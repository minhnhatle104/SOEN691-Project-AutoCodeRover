Currently feature `DeserializationFeature.UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS` is supported by most types, and deserializers tend to implement support using recursion, effectively allowing multiple nested layers of JSON Arrays to be unwrapped.
This is not a feature to support but just an implementation detail; ideally we should only allow a single JSON Array to wrap a value.

I think I have removed ability for deeper nesting from some other types so there may be some prior art.
