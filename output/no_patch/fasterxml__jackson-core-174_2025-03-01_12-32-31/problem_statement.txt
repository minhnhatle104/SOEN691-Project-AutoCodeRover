Add append() to JsonPointer class.
For implementing Json MergePatch (RFC 7386) it would be really helpful to implement an append method to json pointer class.

This method should return a new JsonPointer class containing the previous JsonPointer classes + a new JsonPointer which is the appended one.

WDYT?
