Add `withObjectProperty(String)`, `withArrayProperty(String)` in `JsonNode`
### Describe your Issue

(note: offshoot of #3780, see that for context)

I propose adding 2 new methods that only allow property would make sense:

    withObjectProperty(String)
    withArrayProperty(String)

to help cover existing usage of `JsonNode.with(String)`.
