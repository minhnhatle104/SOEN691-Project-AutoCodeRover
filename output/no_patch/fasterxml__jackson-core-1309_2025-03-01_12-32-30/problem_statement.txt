Relax validation by `NumberInput.looksLikeValidNumber()` to allow trailing dot (like `3.`)
Rules for numbers for which `NumberInput.looksLikeValidNumber(String)` returns true are a superset of JSON number, to roughly correspond to valid Java numbers (but more strict than say YAML).
The reason for this is that it is used by "Stringified numbers" functionality -- databind level functionality that takes JSON String (or XML, YAML, CSV etc for other backends) and coerces into valid `Number`. Given that different backends have different number validation rules this functionality needs to avoid being too strict.

Specific differences from JSON number so far includes:

1. Allow leading `+` sign (so `+10.25` is valid unlike in JSON)
2. Allow omitting of leading `0` in front of `.` (so `.00006` and `-.025` are valid)

but one case that got accidentally stricter with 2.17 wrt "trailing" dot: values like `3.` were previously allowed (in 2.16). So let's again allow this case.
