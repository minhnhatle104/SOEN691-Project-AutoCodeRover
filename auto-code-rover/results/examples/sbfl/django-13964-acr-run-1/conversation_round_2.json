The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\norder = Order()\norder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\norder.product.save()\norder.save()\nassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered the following context about the `Product` and `Order` models within the codebase:\n\n1. **Product Model**:\n   - There are 5 classes named `Product` across different files in the codebase. However, without more specific information about which file or context the issue pertains to, it's difficult to determine which `Product` class is directly related to the issue described. \n   - The search for a custom `save` method within any `Product` class returned no results, suggesting that the `Product` model(s) rely on Django's default `save` behavior.\n\n2. **Order Model**:\n   - There are 3 classes named `Order` found in different parts of the codebase. None of the provided `Order` class definitions directly match the description in the issue, which indicates that the specific `Order` model in question might be in a different part of the codebase or the issue description abstracts some details for simplicity.\n   - Similar to the `Product` model, there was no custom `save` method found for the `Order` model, indicating reliance on Django's default `save` behavior.\n\n3. **ForeignKey Relationship**:\n   - The search for the specific code snippet defining a ForeignKey relationship from `Order` to `Product` using `ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)` did not return any results. This suggests that either the relationship is defined in a manner not exactly matching the search string or it's located in a part of the codebase not covered by the search.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around the handling of non-numeric primary keys in Django models and their behavior when related objects are saved. The absence of custom `save` methods in both `Product` and `Order` models suggests that the issue might be related to Django's internal handling of ForeignKey relationships, especially when dealing with deferred assignments of non-auto primary keys.\n\nTo proceed without direct access to the specific `Product` and `Order` model definitions involved in the issue, we can hypothesize potential solutions based on common Django patterns and practices. However, it's important to note that without pinpointing the exact models and their files, any proposed solution would need validation against the actual codebase to ensure it addresses the issue correctly."

However, based on the issue description, the bug likely resides in the handling of ForeignKey relationships in Django models, particularly in scenarios involving non-numeric primary keys.

This suggests that either the `Product` model is defined in a different file than initially assumed or the search query might not have matched the exact code syntax used in the file.\n\n2. **Order Model**:\n   - We found the `Order` model in `tests/queries/models.py`, but the definition does not match the one described in the issue. The found `Order` model uses an `IntegerField` as its primary key and does not have a `ForeignKey` relationship to a `Product` model. This indicates that the specific `Order` model related to the issue might still be unidentified or the issue description abstracts from the actual code for simplicity.\n\n3. **ForeignKey Relationship**:\n   - The search for the `ForeignKey` relationship definition using `ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)` did not return any results. This could mean that the actual definition uses a different syntax or parameters than those provided in the search query, or it might be located in a part of the codebase not easily identified with the given information.\n\n**Analysis**:\nGiven the discrepancy between the search results and the issue description, it's clear that we have not yet located the exact `Product` and `Order` model definitions involved in the issue. The absence of a `ForeignKey` relationship in the identified `Order` model further complicates pinpointing the exact location of the bug.\n\nThe issue seems to revolve around the handling of `ForeignKey` relationships, especially when the related object's primary key is a non-numeric field (like a `CharField`) and is assigned after the object is instantiated. However, without the exact model definitions and relationships, proposing a specific solution or identifying the bug's location remains challenging.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nWe need more context to accurately address the issue. Specifically, we need to locate the correct `Product` model definition and the correct `Order` model that matches the issue description. Additionally, understanding how Django's ORM handles the assignment of `ForeignKey` fields when the related object's primary key is set after instantiation could provide insights into the cause of the issue.\n\nWithout further information or access to more of the codebase, we can only hypothesize that the issue might be related to how Django tracks changes to model fields, especially primary keys, and how these changes are propagated through related objects."
