Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific codebase and based on a general understanding of Django's ORM system, I'll provide a conceptual patch. This patch aims to address the issue of Django not recognizing changes to a non-numeric primary key on a related model (`Product`) after instantiation but before saving, which affects the `Order` model's foreign key reference.

Please note, the actual implementation may vary based on the specific details of your models and the Django version you are using. The provided patch is hypothetical and intended to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue described.

# modification 1
```python
<file>app/models.py</file>  # Hypothetical file path, replace with the actual path in your project
<original>
class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</original>
<patched>
class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Ensure the product instance is saved and has a valid SKU before saving the Order
        if self.product.pk is None:
            self.product.save()
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the `Product` instance associated with an `Order` is saved and has a valid primary key (`sku`) before the `Order` itself is saved. This approach addresses the issue where the `Order` model's `product_id` might not be correctly set due to the `Product` instance's `sku` being assigned after the `Order` instance is created but before it's saved.

Keep in mind, this is a simplified solution and might need to be adapted to fit the specific logic and requirements of your application, including handling any potential exceptions or side effects related to saving the `Product` instance within the `Order`'s `save` method. Additionally, this solution assumes that saving the `Product` instance does not have undesirable side effects or dependencies that need to be considered.

This patch is provided based on a general understanding of Django models and the issue description. It's essential to thoroughly test this change within the context of your application to ensure it addresses the issue without introducing new problems.
