            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: Yes, we do need more context to accurately pinpoint the issue and propose a viable solution. The following search API calls could provide the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"class Product(models.Model):\", \"tests/queries/models.py\")`: Since the issue description involves a `Product` model with a `CharField` as its primary key, this search aims to find the specific `Product` model definition in the likely file based on the structure of the project.\n\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"class Order(models.Model):\", \"tests/queries/models.py\")`: Similar to the `Product` model, this search is to locate the specific `Order` model definition within the same file, assuming both models are defined in close proximity given their relationship.\n\n3. `search_code(\"ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\")`: Repeating this search without file restriction might help locate the ForeignKey definition if it was missed due to a mismatch in the search query and the actual codebase.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: Without the exact file paths and class definitions, it's challenging to specify the buggy files and methods with certainty. However, based on the issue description, the bug likely resides in the handling of ForeignKey relationships in Django models, particularly in scenarios involving non-numeric primary keys. The models in question are `Product` and `Order`, but without specific file paths or confirmation of the model definitions, it's difficult to pinpoint exact locations."
