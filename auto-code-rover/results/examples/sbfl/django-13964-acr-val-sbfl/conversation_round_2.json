The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\norder = Order()\norder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\norder.product.save()\norder.save()\nassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided code snippets and the issue description, we can deduce a few key points that are central to understanding and resolving the bug:\n\n1. **ForeignKey Resolution (`resolve_related_fields` in `ForeignKey`):**\n   - The `resolve_related_fields` method in the `ForeignKey` class is responsible for resolving the fields related to the ForeignKey relationship. It checks if the related field's model matches the expected model and raises an error if not. This method ensures the integrity of the relationship at a model level but does not seem directly involved in the issue of the primary key not being recognized after assignment.\n\n2. **Preparation of Related Fields for Save (`_prepare_related_fields_for_save` in `Model`):**\n   - This method is crucial for ensuring that related objects are correctly prepared before saving the parent model. It performs checks to ensure that a model instance without a primary key (PK) hasn't been incorrectly assigned to a ForeignKey or OneToOneField. If the related object's PK is `None`, it raises a `ValueError` to prevent data loss.\n   - Importantly, it also handles the case where the PK of a related object is assigned after the object has been assigned to a ForeignKey field. If the related object's PK is set after assignment, it updates the ForeignKey field's value to reflect the new PK. This is done by setting the ForeignKey field's value (`field.attname`) to the related object's PK (`obj.pk`).\n   - The method also takes care of clearing the cached relationship if the relationship's PK or `to_field` was changed after the assignment.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem seems to arise when the primary key of a related object (`Product`) is set after the object has been assigned to a ForeignKey field in another model (`Order`). According to the issue, the `Order` model does not recognize the change in the `Product` model's primary key, leading to a situation where the `Order` model's `product_id` field is incorrectly set to an empty string instead of being updated to reflect the `Product` model's `sku`.\n\nThe method `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` appears to be designed to handle such scenarios by updating the ForeignKey field with the related object's PK if it has been saved after an assignment. However, the issue suggests that this mechanism is not functioning as expected for non-auto CharField primary keys.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method correctly updates the ForeignKey field (`Order.product_id`) with the related object's primary key (`Product.sku`) when the related object's primary key is set after the assignment. This might involve investigating how changes to the primary key of related objects are detected and ensuring that these changes are propagated to the ForeignKey field before the parent model is saved."
