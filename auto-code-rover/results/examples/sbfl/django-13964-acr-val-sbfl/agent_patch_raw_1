Explanation:
The patch addresses the issue where the `Order` model's `product_id` field is set to an empty string instead of being updated with the `Product` model's `sku` when the `sku` is assigned after the `Product` instance is associated with the `Order`. The original code only updates the `field.attname` if it is `None`. The patched version includes an additional check for an empty string (`""`), ensuring that the foreign key field is updated correctly even if it was initially set to an empty string. This change should prevent the data loss issue described in the bug report.
