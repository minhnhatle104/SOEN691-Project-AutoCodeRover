The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\norder = Order()\norder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\norder.product.save()\norder.save()\nassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `ForeignKey` relationship is managed within the Django ORM, particularly how assignment and saving of related objects with non-numeric primary keys are handled. The issue description suggests a problem with the assignment of a `ForeignKey` field before the related object's primary key is set and saved. This implies we should look into the mechanisms by which Django tracks and saves related objects' primary keys, especially in cases where the primary key is not an auto-incrementing integer (e.g., a `CharField` used as a primary key).\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will be necessary to gather more context and potentially identify the source of the bug:\n\n1. **Search for the `Product` class**: This will help us understand the definition of the primary key that is causing the issue.\n   - `search_class(\"Product\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `Order` class**: This will provide insight into how the `ForeignKey` relationship is defined.\n   - `search_class(\"Order\")`\n\n3. **Search for the assignment handling of `ForeignKey` fields**: Since the issue might be related to how the assignment of a `ForeignKey` field is handled when the related object's primary key changes, we need to look into the Django ORM code that manages this.\n   - `search_method(\"ForeignKey\")`\n\n4. **Search for the save method in the `Product` class**: This could give us clues on how saving a model with a `CharField` as a primary key behaves differently, if at all.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Product\")`\n\n5. **Search for the save method in the `Order` class**: This will help us understand if there's any custom logic that might affect how the `ForeignKey` relationship is saved.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Order\")`\n\n6. **Search for transaction handling**: Since the issue occurs within a transaction, understanding how Django handles transactions might provide insights.\n   - `search_code(\"transaction.atomic()\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at dissecting the problem from multiple angles: the model definitions, the handling of `ForeignKey` assignments, the saving mechanism of models, and the transaction handling within Django. This comprehensive approach should help in identifying the root cause of the issue and formulating a patch."

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search API calls, let's analyze the context and findings to understand the issue better and plan the next steps towards a solution.\n\n1. **Classes `Product` and `Order`**:\n   - The search for the `Product` class revealed 5 matches across different test files, but none of these files were explicitly mentioned in the issue description. This suggests that the issue might not be directly related to the specific implementations of the `Product` class in these test files but rather to how Django handles models with non-numeric primary keys in general.\n   - The search for the `Order` class found 3 different implementations in the codebase. However, none of these implementations match the description provided in the issue. This indicates that the issue description might be referring to a hypothetical or simplified example to illustrate the problem rather than a specific implementation in the codebase.\n\n2. **`ForeignKey` Method**:\n   - The search did not find a method named `ForeignKey`, which is expected because `ForeignKey` in Django is a field type rather than a method. This misunderstanding in the search query highlights the need to focus on how Django's ORM handles `ForeignKey` field assignments and updates, particularly in relation to model saving and primary key handling.\n\n3. **`save` Method in `Product` and `Order` Classes**:\n   - No custom `save` methods were found in the `Product` or `Order` classes. This suggests that the issue is not related to custom save logic in these models but rather to Django's internal handling of model saving and foreign key relationships.\n\n4. **Usage of `transaction.atomic()`**:\n   - The search found 162 snippets containing `transaction.atomic()` across various files, indicating that transaction management is a common pattern in the codebase. However, without specific references to how transactions interact with the saving of models with non-numeric primary keys, this information is too broad to directly address the issue at hand.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nThe issue appears to be a more fundamental problem with Django's ORM system, specifically how it handles the assignment and saving of models related by a `ForeignKey` where the related model uses a non-numeric primary key. The problem occurs when the primary key of the related model (`Product`) is set after the model is assigned to a `ForeignKey` field (`product` field in `Order`). The ORM fails to update the `ForeignKey` field with the correct primary key value upon saving the related model.\n\n**Next Steps**:\nGiven the analysis, the next steps should involve a deeper dive into Django's ORM layer to understand how `ForeignKey` assignments are tracked and updated, especially in the context of non-numeric primary keys and transaction boundaries. This might involve reviewing Django's ORM source code directly, as the search queries did not yield specific enough information to pinpoint the issue within the provided codebase excerpts."
