            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: Yes, we need more context to understand how Django's ORM handles `ForeignKey` relationships, especially with non-numeric primary keys. The following search API calls could provide more insights:\n\n1. **Search Django ORM ForeignKey handling**: Since `ForeignKey` is a field, not a method, we need to understand how Django ORM handles the assignment and update of `ForeignKey` fields. A more appropriate query might involve looking into the source code or documentation directly, which is not possible with the provided API. However, a hypothetical API call could look like:\n   - `search_code(\"ForeignKey handling\")`\n\n2. **Search for Django model saving process**: Understanding the model saving process, especially how related objects are handled, could provide insights into where the bug might be.\n   - `search_code(\"save related model\")`\n\n3. **Search for Django transaction management**: Since the issue occurs within a transaction, it would be useful to understand how Django manages transactions, especially in relation to saving models.\n   - `search_code(\"manage transactions with models\")`\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: Without direct access to the Django ORM source code or more specific search results related to the handling of `ForeignKey` fields and model saving, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact locations of the bug. However, the issue likely resides within:\n  - **Buggy files and methods**: The bug is likely within the Django ORM layer that handles:\n    - The assignment and update of `ForeignKey` fields, particularly how changes to the primary key of a related model are propagated to the model holding the `ForeignKey`.\n    - The model saving process, especially how it deals with related models and their primary keys within transactions.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it's probable that the bug is not localized to a single file or method but may involve several parts of the ORM system that work together to manage `ForeignKey` relationships and transactions."
