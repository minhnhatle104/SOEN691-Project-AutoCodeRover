The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\norder = Order()\norder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\norder.product.save()\norder.save()\nassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered some context about the `Product` and `Order` classes, but it seems there were no direct hits for the specific models described in the issue. The search results show various `Product` and `Order` classes across different test files, but none of them match the exact structure described in the issue. This suggests that the issue might be related to a custom implementation or a more generic problem in Django's handling of ForeignKey relationships and transactions, rather than something specific to the found classes.\n\nThe inability to find the `django.db.models.fields.related` class and the `transaction.atomic` method in the codebase could be due to limitations in the search API's scope or inaccuracies in the provided class and method names. It's also possible that the codebase has custom implementations or wrappers around these functionalities.\n\nGiven the information we have:\n\n1. **ForeignKey Assignment Issue**: The core of the problem seems to be how ForeignKey relationships handle the assignment of related objects, especially when the primary key of the related object is set after the assignment. This could be a more general issue with Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, particularly in how it tracks changes to model fields and their impact on related fields.\n\n2. **Transaction Handling**: The issue description mentions that the foreign key constraint is deferred until the transaction commits, which leads to a failure due to the non-existence of a product with an empty string as its primary key. This suggests a potential problem in how transactions are managed or how constraints are checked within transactions.\n\nGiven the lack of direct hits on the specific classes and methods involved in the issue, the next steps would involve a deeper dive into Django's documentation or source code related to ForeignKey field assignment and transaction management. Additionally, reviewing the Django project's issue tracker for similar problems reported by other users could provide insights or potential workarounds.\n\nTo move forward with a patch or a workaround, we would need to:\n\n- Investigate Django's handling of ForeignKey relationships, especially updates to related object's primary keys after assignment.\n- Review Django's transaction management system to understand how and when constraints are enforced.\n- Consider implementing a custom save method for the `Order` model that ensures the `product_id` is correctly updated before saving, based on the current state of the `product` instance.\n\nWithout direct access to the relevant parts of Django's source code or further details from the project's codebase, these recommendations are based on a general understanding of the described issue and common practices in handling similar ORM and transaction-related challenges."
