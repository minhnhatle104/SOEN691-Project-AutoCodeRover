The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\norder = Order()\norder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\norder.product.save()\norder.save()\nassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered the following context about the issue:\n\n1. **Classes Overview**:\n   - There are five `Product` classes found across different files in the codebase. The issue description does not specify which one is involved, but given the nature of the issue, it's likely related to models handling relationships, such as foreign keys.\n   - There are three `Order` classes found, each in a different file and with different fields and relationships. None of the provided `Order` class definitions directly match the one described in the issue, suggesting that the exact class might be in a different part of the codebase or the issue description abstracts some details for simplicity.\n\n2. **Method and Code Snippet Searches**:\n   - No custom `save` methods were found in either the `Product` or `Order` classes from the search results. This indicates that the issue might not be related to custom save logic within these models but could be a more systemic issue related to Django's handling of foreign key relationships and primary key assignments.\n   - The search for `product_id` did not yield results, which could mean that direct references to `product_id` are either dynamically handled by Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or are not explicitly manipulated in a way that the search could detect.\n\nGiven these findings, the issue seems to stem from a more fundamental aspect of how Django handles the assignment and saving of models with non-numeric primary keys, especially in the context of foreign key relationships. The absence of custom `save` methods and direct references to `product_id` suggests that the problem is not with custom logic but possibly with Django's built-in mechanisms for managing model instances and their relationships.\n\nTo proceed with addressing the issue, we might consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Further Investigation**: Since the exact `Product` and `Order` classes involved in the issue were not identified, it might be necessary to manually review the files mentioned in the search results or to refine the search criteria based on additional context from the issue description or the codebase.\n\n2. **Django Documentation and Source Code**: Reviewing Django's documentation and source code related to model saving, foreign key handling, and transaction atomicity could provide insights into potential causes of the issue. This might include how Django tracks changes to model fields, especially primary keys, and updates foreign key references before and after saving.\n\n3. **Testing and Reproduction**: Attempting to reproduce the issue in a controlled environment or test case could help isolate the conditions under which the problem occurs. This might involve creating minimal models that mimic the structure and behavior described in the issue and testing different sequences of operations to observe how Django handles the primary key and foreign key assignments.\n\n4. **Community and Django Developers**: If the issue appears to be a bug or unintended behavior in Django itself, it might be worth consulting with the Django community or developers. They could provide additional insights or confirm if this behavior is known and whether there are existing workarounds or plans for a fix.\n\nAddressing the issue will likely require a combination of further investigation, testing, and potentially engaging with the broader Django community or contributors to identify a suitable solution or workaround."

This diversity suggests that the issue might not be tied to a specific instance of these models but could potentially affect any scenario where a `Product` model with a non-numeric primary key is related to an `Order` model.\n\n2. **Absence of Direct Matches to the Issue Description**:\n   - None of the `Order` class definitions provided in the search results directly match the description provided in the issue. This discrepancy implies that the exact models involved in the issue might not have been indexed by the search or that the issue description abstracts the model definitions for simplicity.\n\n3. **Lack of Custom Save Methods**:\n   - The search did not find custom `save` methods within the `Product` or `Order` classes, suggesting that the issue likely arises from Django's built-in behavior regarding foreign key relationships and primary key handling, rather than from custom model logic.\n\n4. **Considerations for Further Investigation**:\n   - Given the generic nature of the models involved and the absence of custom save logic, the issue might stem from a more systemic aspect of Django's ORM, particularly how it handles the assignment and persistence of foreign key relationships when the related object's primary key is a non-auto CharField that gets defined after the relationship is established.\n\n5. **Potential Bug Locations**:\n   - While we cannot pinpoint exact buggy files or methods without more specific information, the issue likely resides in the underlying mechanisms of Django's ORM that manage the lifecycle of model instances and their relationships. Specifically, the handling of deferred foreign key assignments and the update of related fields upon saving might be areas of interest.\n\n6. **Next Steps**:\n   - To further diagnose and address the issue, it might be beneficial to manually inspect the files mentioned in the search results for any custom behaviors or configurations that could affect the described scenario. Additionally, reviewing Django's documentation and source code related to model relationships, primary key handling, and transaction management could provide insights into potential causes and solutions.\n\nIn summary, while the collected context does not directly reveal the location of the bug, it highlights the need for a deeper investigation into Django's handling of model relationships and primary key assignments. The issue appears to be rooted in the framework's core ORM functionality, necessitating a broader examination of Django's model management mechanisms."

The necessary context involves understanding Django's handling of foreign key relationships and primary key assignments, particularly for non-numeric primary keys, which is more about Django's internal mechanics than about specific project files.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n  Given the information provided and the nature of the issue, the \"bug\" does not seem to reside within a specific file or method in the user's project but rather in the understanding and usage of Django's ORM, especially regarding the timing and sequence of setting primary keys on related objects. The issue described is likely a consequence of how Django's ORM defers the assignment of foreign key references until the related object is saved and has a valid primary key. This behavior is not necessarily a bug in Django but a characteristic of how Django's ORM manages relationships and transactions.\n\nTo address the issue described, the focus should be on ensuring that any object assigned as a foreign key reference has a valid primary key before being associated with another object. This might involve reviewing and adjusting the logic in the application that creates and associates `Product` and `Order` instances to ensure that `Product` instances have their `sku` (primary key) set before being assigned to an `Order`.\n\nWithout specific buggy files or methods to correct, the solution involves adjusting the application's logic and understanding Django's ORM behavior rather than fixing a particular piece of code."
