The issue arises when the `Product` instance's `sku` is set after it has been assigned to an `Order`, leading to unexpected behavior where the `Order` does not recognize the updated `sku`.\n\n2. **Potential Causes**: This could be related to how Django's ORM handles the lifecycle of model instances, particularly how and when it updates foreign key references in related models. Since no custom `save` methods or signal handlers were identified in the `Product` or `Order` models that could directly cause this issue, it suggests the problem might be with Django's built-in mechanisms or with how the models are being used.\n\n3. **Recommended Steps**:\n   - **Review Django's Documentation**: Specifically, look into sections covering model relationships, foreign keys, and the model saving process. There might be insights or best practices regarding the order of operations when setting primary keys and saving related models.\n   - **Inspect Model Definitions**: Re-examine the `Product` and `Order` model definitions to ensure they align with Django's expectations for models with custom primary keys and foreign key relationships.\n   - **Test in Isolation**: Try to reproduce the issue in a simplified Django project with just the `Product` and `Order` models. This can help determine if the issue is with Django's handling of the scenario or something specific to the larger codebase.\n   - **Seek Community Input**: If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the Django community through forums or the Django Users mailing list. Others might have encountered and solved similar issues.\n\n4. **Further Investigation**: Without the ability to perform additional search API calls or access more detailed information from the codebase, focusing on Django's documentation and community resources for guidance is the best path forward.\n\nIf you have specific code snippets, error messages, or further details about the issue, sharing those can help in providing more targeted advice based on that information."
