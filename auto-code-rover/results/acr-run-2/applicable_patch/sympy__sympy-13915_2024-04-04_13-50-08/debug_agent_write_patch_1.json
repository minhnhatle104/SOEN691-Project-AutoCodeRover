        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified key files and methods that are likely related to the issue reported. The issue revolves around the behavior of the `subs` and `limit` methods when dealing with expressions that lead to undefined results under certain substitutions. Here's a summary of the findings and how they might relate to the issue:\n\n1. **`subs` Method Context**:\n   - The `subs` method is found in several files, but given the context of the issue, which involves symbolic manipulation, the most relevant file is likely `sympy/core/basic.py`. This file is part of the core of SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, and is where fundamental classes and methods are defined.\n   - Other files like `sympy/polys/fields.py`, `sympy/polys/rings.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, and `sympy/matrices/common.py` also contain `subs` methods, but these are more specific to polynomial algebra, vector physics, and matrices, and might not be directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n2. **`limit` Method Context**:\n   - The `limit` method is found in `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. Given the nature of the issue, which involves calculating the limit of an expression as a variable approaches a certain value, these files are highly relevant. `sympy/series/limits.py` is likely where the logic for limit calculation is implemented, while `sympy/core/expr.py` could contain more general expressions handling, including limit operations.\n   - The other files, `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py` and `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`, might contain specialized implementations of limits for hypergeometric functions and matrices, respectively.\n\nGiven this context, the core issue seems to be with how the `subs` method behaves or is expected to behave when a substitution leads to an undefined expression, and how the `limit` method is a potential workaround for such cases. The unexpected behavior (getting `1` instead of an undefined result or an error) suggests there might be a need to improve the handling of undefined expressions in the `subs` method or to provide clearer documentation or warnings when such situations arise.\n\nTo proceed with addressing the issue, a deeper analysis of the implementation and intended behavior of the `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and the `limit` method in `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` would be necessary. This could involve reviewing the code for these methods to understand their current handling of undefined expressions and considering whether changes are needed to address the reported issue."

The first modification introduces a check for undefined expressions after substitution and attempts to calculate the limit if the result is infinite. The second modification improves the handling of limits that are infinite in both directions, ensuring that the limit is correctly identified as infinite when appropriate."
