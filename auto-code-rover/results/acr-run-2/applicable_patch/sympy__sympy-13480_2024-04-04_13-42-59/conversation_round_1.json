The problematic code snippet is:\n\n```python\nif m:\n    cothm = coth(m)\n    if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:\n        return coth(x)\n    else: # cothm == 0\n        return tanh(x)\n```\n\nThe error reported in the issue is a `NameError` for `cotm` not being defined. This suggests that there's a typo or a variable that has not been correctly initialized or used within the scope of this method. The variable `cotm` is being checked against `S.ComplexInfinity`, but it seems like `cotm` was either supposed to be `cothm` or `cotm` was not defined or imported correctly.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to resolve the issue would involve:\n1. Verifying if `cotm` is indeed a typo and should be replaced with `cothm`.\n2. If `cotm` is not a typo, ensuring that it is correctly defined and imported before being used in this condition.\n\nBefore proceeding with a patch, it would be beneficial to review the implementation of the `coth` method and any related methods or variables (`cotm`, `cothm`) to understand their intended use and ensure that the correct variable is being used in this condition."
