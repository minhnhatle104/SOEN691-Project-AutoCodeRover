        "content": "Based on the search result, the issue occurs within the `format` function in the `numberformat.py` file, which is part of the Django utilities. The problematic code snippet is:\n\n```python\nelse:\n    str_number = str(number)\nif str_number[0] == \"-\":\n    sign = \"-\"\n    str_number = str_number[1:]\n```\n\nThe error described in the issue, `IndexError: string index out of range`, happens when the `number` variable is `None` (null in Python terminology). In this case, converting `None` to a string results in the string `'None'`, which does not cause an immediate error. However, if `number` is an empty string or somehow becomes an empty string before this check, attempting to access `str_number[0]` will indeed raise an `IndexError` because there are no characters in an empty string.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to ensure that `str_number` is not empty before attempting to access its first character. A simple and effective way to do this is to check the length of `str_number` or directly check if `str_number` is not empty. This check should be added before the problematic line to prevent the error from occurring.\n\nLet's proceed to draft a patch for this issue."
