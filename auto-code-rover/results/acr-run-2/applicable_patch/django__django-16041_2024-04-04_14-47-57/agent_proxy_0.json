            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how `empty_form` is handled within the formset and how `form_kwargs` are applied to it. Specifically, we are looking for how the `empty_permitted` parameter within `form_kwargs` affects the rendering of `empty_form` and leads to a `KeyError`. To get more context and find the relevant sections of the codebase to patch, I will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the class that handles formsets**: Since the issue is related to formsets and their `empty_form` property, we need to find the class that Django uses to manage formsets. This will likely be something like `BaseFormSet` or a similar name in Django's form handling system.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the method that initializes or handles `empty_form`**: To understand how `empty_permitted` is causing a `KeyError` when rendering `empty_form`, we need to find where `empty_form` is initialized or modified in the formset class.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for how `form_kwargs` are applied to forms in a formset**: Since the issue arises when `form_kwargs` are passed with `empty_permitted`, we need to understand how these kwargs are applied to forms within a formset, and specifically to `empty_form`.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should provide us with enough context to understand the problem and start working on a patch to fix the issue."
