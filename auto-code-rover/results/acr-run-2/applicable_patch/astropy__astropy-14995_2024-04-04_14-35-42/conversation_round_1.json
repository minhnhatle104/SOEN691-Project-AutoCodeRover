This is not a problem in v5.2.\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n### Expected behavior\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n### How to Reproduce\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\n```\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\n[ 8,  0,  1],\n[ 2,  1,  0]])\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n```\n### Versions\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\nastropy 5.3\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\nNumpy 1.24.3\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\nScipy 1.10.1\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\n</issue>"

The `NDDataRef` class inherits from several mixins, including `NDArithmeticMixin`. This is crucial information because, although the `multiply` method was not found directly within the `NDDataRef` class, the mention of `NDArithmeticMixin` suggests that arithmetic operations, including multiplication, are likely handled by this mixin. \n\nGiven that the `multiply` method could not be found directly in `NDDataRef`, and considering the error involves mask propagation during arithmetic operations, it's reasonable to infer that the issue might lie within the `NDArithmeticMixin` or how `NDDataRef` utilizes it, particularly in how masks are handled when one of the operands does not have a mask.\n\nTo further investigate, we should look into the `NDArithmeticMixin` to understand how it implements arithmetic operations and handles masks. This will help us pinpoint where the issue with mask propagation during the `multiply` operation arises, especially since the error message indicates a problem when attempting to use `np.bitwise_or` on a mask that is `None`.\n\nNext steps for investigation:\n- Search for the `NDArithmeticMixin` class to understand its implementation of arithmetic operations and mask handling.\n- Given the error involves `np.bitwise_or`, it would also be beneficial to search for how this function is used in relation to masks within the arithmetic operations.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n- `search_class(\"NDArithmeticMixin\")`\n- `search_code(\"np.bitwise_or\")`"
