Based on the context provided and the issue at hand, it appears that the problem might not be directly within the test methods themselves but rather in how `Struct` is being referenced or expected to be resolved in the documentation tests. However, given the specific examples provided, a potential patch could involve ensuring that `Struct` is correctly imported or referenced within the test file to align with Sphinx's expectations for resolving type annotations. Since the exact cause of the issue as it relates to Sphinx's autodoc not being able to resolve `struct.Struct` isn't directly shown in the snippets, the patch will focus on correcting a possible oversight in the test assertions related to `Struct`.

Assuming `Struct` should be imported from the `struct` module for these tests to correctly reference it:

# modification 1
```python
<file>tests/test_util_typing.py</file>
<original>def test_restify():
    assert restify(int) == ":class:`int`"
    assert restify(str) == ":class:`str`"
    assert restify(None) == ":obj:`None`"
    assert restify(Integral) == ":class:`numbers.Integral`"
    assert restify(Struct) == ":class:`struct.Struct`"
    assert restify(Any) == ":obj:`Any`"
</original>
<patched>import struct
from numbers import Integral
from typing import Any

def test_restify():
    assert restify(int) == ":class:`int`"
    assert restify(str) == ":class:`str`"
    assert restify(None) == ":obj:`None`"
    assert restify(Integral) == ":class:`numbers.Integral`"
    assert restify(struct.Struct) == ":class:`struct.Struct`"
    assert restify(Any) == ":obj:`Any`"
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>tests/test_util_typing.py</file>
<original>def test_stringify():
    assert stringify(int) == "int"
    assert stringify(str) == "str"
    assert stringify(None) == "None"
    assert stringify(Integral) == "numbers.Integral"
    assert restify(Struct) == ":class:`struct.Struct`"
    assert stringify(Any) == "Any"
</original>
<patched>import struct
from numbers import Integral
from typing import Any

def test_stringify():
    assert stringify(int) == "int"
    assert stringify(str) == "str"
    assert stringify(None) == "None"
    assert stringify(Integral) == "numbers.Integral"
    assert stringify(struct.Struct) == "struct.Struct"
    assert stringify(Any) == "Any"
</patched>
```

These modifications ensure that `struct.Struct` is correctly referenced in the test methods, aligning with Python's import and usage conventions. This approach assumes that the issue might be partly due to how `Struct` is referenced in these tests, which might not match how Sphinx autodoc expects to resolve such references. However, if the issue is deeply rooted in Sphinx's configuration or how autodoc processes type annotations, further adjustments in the Sphinx setup or autodoc extension might be necessary.
