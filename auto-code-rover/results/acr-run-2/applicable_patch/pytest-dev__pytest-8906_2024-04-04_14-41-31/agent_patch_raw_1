<original>"""Skip an executing test with the given message.

    This function should be called only during testing (setup, call or teardown) or
    during collection by using the ``allow_module_level`` flag.  This function can
    be called in doctests as well.

    :param bool allow_module_level:
        Allows this function to be called at module level, skipping the rest
        of the module. Defaults to False.

    .. note::
        It is better to use the :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref` marker when
        possible to declare a test to be skipped under certain conditions
        like mismatching platforms or dependencies.
        Similarly, use the ``# doctest: +SKIP`` directive (see `doctest.SKIP
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/how-to/doctest.html#doctest.SKIP>`_)
        to skip a doctest statically.

    :param bool allow_module_level:
        Allows this function to be called at module level, skipping the rest
        of the module. Defaults to False. This is particularly useful for skipping
        modules that are not compatible with the current Python version or other
        environment constraints.

    .. note::
        It is better to use the :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref` marker when
        possible to declare a test to be skipped under certain conditions
        like mismatching platforms or dependencies. However, for skipping entire
        modules, especially when dealing with syntax or features not supported in
        certain Python versions, using `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` is
        the recommended approach. Ensure to place the skip call at the top of the
        module before any potentially incompatible syntax is encountered.

        Similarly, use the ``# doctest: +SKIP`` directive (see `doctest.SKIP
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/how-to/doctest.html#doctest.SKIP>`_)
        to skip a doctest statically.
        
        For example, to skip a module under Python versions older than 3.8:
        ```
        import sys
        from pytest import skip

        if sys.version_info < (3, 8):
            skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)
        ```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/outcomes.py</file>
<original>raise Skipped(msg=msg, allow_module_level=allow_module_level)</original>
<patched>if not allow_module_level:
    raise ValueError("Using pytest.skip with allow_module_level=False outside of a test is not allowed. To skip a module, set allow_module_level=True.")
raise Skipped(msg=msg, allow_module_level=allow_module_level)</patched>
```

These modifications aim to improve the documentation for the `skip` function to make the usage of `allow_module_level=True` clearer for users, especially for the scenario of skipping entire modules. Additionally, it introduces a more informative error message when attempting to use `pytest.skip` outside of a test without enabling `allow_module_level`, guiding users towards the correct usage.
