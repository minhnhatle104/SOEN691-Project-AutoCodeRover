Given the error message and the context, it seems like the method fails to properly handle the addition of quantities with dimensions that should be compatible or equivalent. \n\nLet's start by gathering more information about the method and the classes involved:\n\n1. Search for the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within the entire codebase to understand its implementation and which class it belongs to.\n2. Search for the class `UnitSystem` since the method seems to be related to handling units and dimensions, and `SI` appears to be an instance of a unit system.\n3. Search for the class `Quantity` as it is directly involved in the issue, being the type of `v1`, `a1`, and `t1`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_collect_factor_and_dimension\")\nsearch_class(\"UnitSystem\")\nsearch_class(\"Quantity\")\n```"
