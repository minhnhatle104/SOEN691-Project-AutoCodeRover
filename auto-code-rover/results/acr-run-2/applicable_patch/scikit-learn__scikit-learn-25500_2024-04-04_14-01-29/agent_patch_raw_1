Explanation:
- **Modification 1**: This patch addresses the core issue where the `predict_proba` method in `CalibratedClassifierCV` fails when the output is a pandas DataFrame due to the global configuration set by `set_config(transform_output="pandas")`. The fix checks if the output `proba` is an instance of `pd.DataFrame`. If it is, it converts the DataFrame to a numpy array using `.values` before performing the addition operation. This ensures compatibility with the expected numpy array format for `mean_proba`.
- **Modification 2**: Since the patch uses `pd.DataFrame`, it's necessary to import pandas (`import pandas as pd`). This modification ensures that pandas is available for the type check and conversion in the patched code.
