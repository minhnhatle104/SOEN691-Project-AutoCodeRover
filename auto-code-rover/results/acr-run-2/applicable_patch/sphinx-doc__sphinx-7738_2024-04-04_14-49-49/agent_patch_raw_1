Given the context and the nature of the issue, the problem seems to stem from how the `NumpyDocstring` class processes attribute docstrings, particularly in handling trailing underscores in attribute names. The `expected` output in the test method `test_underscore_in_attribute_strip_signature_backslash` explicitly shows an escaped underscore (`\\_`), which suggests that the current logic intentionally escapes underscores. However, based on the issue reported, this behavior leads to an undesired visual representation in the generated HTML documentation.

To address the issue, we need to modify the behavior so that trailing underscores in attribute names are not escaped in the final output when `strip_signature_backslash` is set to `True` in the configuration. This involves adjusting the logic within the `NumpyDocstring` processing, specifically where the attribute names are being prepared for output.

Since the exact location within the `NumpyDocstring` class where this processing happens is not provided, I will outline a hypothetical patch based on the provided test method and the described behavior. This patch assumes there's a part of the `NumpyDocstring` class that handles the escaping of underscores in attribute names.

# modification 1
```python
<file>path/to/napoleon/docstring.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet that escapes underscores in attribute names
attribute_name = attribute_name.replace("_", "\\_")
</original>
<patched>
# Patched version to conditionally escape underscores based on `strip_signature_backslash` config
if not config.strip_signature_backslash:
    attribute_name = attribute_name.replace("_", "\\_")
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>tests/test_ext_napoleon_docstring.py</file>
<original>
def test_underscore_in_attribute_strip_signature_backslash(self):
    docstring = """
Attributes
----------

arg_ : type
    some description
"""

    expected = """
:ivar arg\\_: some description
:vartype arg\\_: type
"""

    config = Config(napoleon_use_ivar=True)
    config.strip_signature_backslash = True
    app = mock.Mock()
    actual = str(NumpyDocstring(docstring, config, app, "class"))

    self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
</original>
<patched>
def test_underscore_in_attribute_strip_signature_backslash(self):
    docstring = """
Attributes
----------

arg_ : type
    some description
"""

    # Adjusted expected output to reflect the desired behavior without escaping underscores
    expected = """
:ivar arg_: some description
:vartype arg_: type
"""

    config = Config(napoleon_use_ivar=True)
    config.strip_signature_backslash = True
    app = mock.Mock()
    actual = str(NumpyDocstring(docstring, config, app, "class"))

    self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
</patched>
```

Please note, the first modification is hypothetical and assumes the existence of a specific code snippet responsible for escaping underscores in the `NumpyDocstring` class, which would need to be located and adjusted accordingly. The second modification updates the test to reflect the desired behavior based on the issue description.
