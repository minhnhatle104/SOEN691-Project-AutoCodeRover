These modifications aim to address the issue with `pairplot` raising a `KeyError` when used with a DataFrame that has MultiIndex columns. The first modification ensures that if the DataFrame passed to `pairplot` has MultiIndex columns, they are flattened before any plotting occurs. This is a straightforward approach to make the DataFrame compatible with the existing seaborn plotting functions, which may not handle MultiIndex columns gracefully.

The second modification is more targeted and addresses the specific operation within the `map_diag` method that leads to the `KeyError`. It adds a check to see if the DataFrame's columns are a MultiIndex and, if so, attempts to access the data by a flattened version of the variable name. This approach is more conservative as it only flattens the column names when necessary, preserving the original DataFrame structure outside of the seaborn plotting context.

Note: These patches are conceptual and might require further testing and adjustment to ensure compatibility with all possible use cases and DataFrame structures. Additionally, directly modifying the `data` DataFrame's columns within seaborn functions could have unintended side effects. A more robust solution might involve creating a copy of the DataFrame with flattened columns for plotting purposes, thus preserving the original DataFrame's structure.
