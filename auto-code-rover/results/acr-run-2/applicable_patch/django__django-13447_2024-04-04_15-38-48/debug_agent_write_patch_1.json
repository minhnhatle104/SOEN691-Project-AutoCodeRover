        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search API calls, here's an analysis of the context related to the issue:\n\n1. **Usage of `app_list`**:\n   - The `app_list` variable appears in 43 snippets across the codebase, indicating its widespread use.\n   - It is particularly prevalent in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` with 12 matches, which is significant because the issue mentions manipulating `app_list` in a custom admin view. This file likely contains logic related to how admin views are constructed and rendered, making it a critical area for addressing the issue.\n   - Other files such as `django/core/management/commands/dumpdata.py`, `django/core/serializers/__init__.py`, and various test files also reference `app_list`, suggesting its importance in data serialization and testing scenarios.\n\n2. **The `_build_app_dict` Method**:\n   - The `_build_app_dict` method is found within the `AdminSite` class in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`. This method is responsible for building the app dictionary, which can optionally filter models of a specific app based on the `label` parameter.\n   - The method iterates over models registered to the admin site, checking permissions and constructing a dictionary (`app_dict`) that includes information such as model names, permissions, admin URLs, and add URLs.\n   - The `app_dict` is then used to construct the `app_list` context, as indicated by the reference to `reverse('admin:app_list', kwargs={'app_label': app_label}, current_app=self.name,)` within the method. This suggests that modifications to `_build_app_dict` could directly impact how `app_list` is constructed and what information it contains.\n\n**Implications for Addressing the Issue**:\n- To provide access to the model class within the `app_list` context, modifications to the `_build_app_dict` method in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` are likely required. This could involve adding additional information to the `model_dict` or `app_dict` structures to include model class references.\n- Making `_build_app_dict` public (i.e., removing the leading underscore or providing a public wrapper method) would facilitate its use in custom admin views, as mentioned in the issue. This change would need to be carefully considered for potential impacts on encapsulation and the public API.\n\nThe next steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the `_build_app_dict` method to include model class information in the `app_list` context and potentially making the method public or accessible through a public interface."
