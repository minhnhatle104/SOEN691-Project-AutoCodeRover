# modification 2
```python
<file>django/contrib/admin/sites.py</file>
<original>def _build_app_dict(self, request, label=None):</original>
<patched>def build_app_dict(self, request, label=None):  # Made the method public by removing the leading underscore</patched>
```

These modifications address the issue by including the model class directly in the `model_dict` within the `_build_app_dict` method, allowing for easier manipulation of the `app_list` in custom admin views as requested. Additionally, making the `_build_app_dict` method public (now `build_app_dict`) allows for its use outside of the `AdminSite` class, providing greater flexibility for developers working with Django's admin framework.
