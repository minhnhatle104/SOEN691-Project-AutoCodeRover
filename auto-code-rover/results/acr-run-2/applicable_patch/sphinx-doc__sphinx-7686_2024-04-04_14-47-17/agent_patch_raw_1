```

Explanation:
The original condition in the `get_members` function was intended to skip imported members based on the `imported` flag and the comparison of the member's `__module__` attribute to the `obj.__name__`. However, this logic does not correctly filter out imported members when `imported_members` is set to `False`. The patched version corrects this by explicitly checking that `imported` is `False` and that the member's `__module__` does not match the `obj.__module__`, which is a more accurate way to determine if a member is imported. This change ensures that when `imported_members` is `False`, only members that are defined within the module itself (not imported from other modules) are included.
