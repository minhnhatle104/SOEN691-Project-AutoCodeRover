This patch addresses the `IndexError: too many indices for array` by ensuring that the indexing into `coefs_paths` is within bounds. The modification uses the modulo operator `%` to wrap the index around the corresponding dimension size of `coefs_paths`, thus preventing an index out of bounds error. This solution assumes that the primary issue is related to incorrect indexing due to the shape of `coefs_paths` not being properly accounted for when `refit=False`. This approach maintains the original logic's intent while ensuring safe indexing.
