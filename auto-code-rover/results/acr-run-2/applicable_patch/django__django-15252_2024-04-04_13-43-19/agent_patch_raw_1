```

This patch modifies the `ensure_schema` method in the `MigrationRecorder` class to respect the `allow_migrate` rules defined in the project's database router(s). It does this by importing the `router` module from `django.db` and using the `allow_migrate` method to check if migrations are allowed for the model associated with the `MigrationRecorder` on the current database connection (`self.connection.alias`). If `allow_migrate` returns `False`, the method returns early without attempting to create the migrations table. This approach ensures that the migrations table is only created in databases where migrations are permitted according to the project's routing logic.
