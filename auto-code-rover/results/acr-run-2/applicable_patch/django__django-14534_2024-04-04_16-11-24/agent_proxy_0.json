Specifically, we should look into the `BoundField` and `BoundWidget` classes, and the `id_for_label` method within `BoundWidget`. Additionally, understanding how `subwidgets` method is implemented in `BoundField` could provide insights into how the `id` attribute is handled.\n\nLet's start by searching for these classes and methods to get a better understanding of their implementation and how they interact with each other:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BoundField\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of the `BoundField` class, especially the `subwidgets` method mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. `search_class(\"BoundWidget\")`: This will provide insights into the `BoundWidget` class, focusing on the `id_for_label` method which seems to be at the core of the issue.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"id_for_label\", \"BoundWidget\")`: To get the exact implementation of the `id_for_label` method within the `BoundWidget` class, which is reported to ignore the `id` set by `ChoiceWidget.options`.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"subwidgets\", \"BoundField\")`: To understand how `subwidgets` is implemented in the `BoundField` class and how it handles the `id` attribute. \n\nThese searches should provide enough context to understand the problem and start working on a patch."
