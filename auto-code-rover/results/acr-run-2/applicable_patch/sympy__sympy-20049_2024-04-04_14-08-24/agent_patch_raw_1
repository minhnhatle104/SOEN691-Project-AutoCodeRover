This patch attempts to address the issue by enhancing the `vel` method in the `Point` class. If the velocity of the point has not been explicitly defined in the given reference frame, the method now iterates over the `_pos_dict` of the point, which contains information about its position relative to other points. For each relative position vector found, it tries to calculate the time derivative with respect to the given frame, which represents the velocity. If successful, this velocity is set for the point in the frame, and then returned. If no velocity can be calculated this way, the original error is raised, indicating that the velocity has not been defined.

This approach assumes that the position vectors stored in `_pos_dict` are expressed in terms that allow for differentiation with respect to the frame (i.e., they are functions of time or include dynamicsymbols). If the differentiation fails (for example, if the position vector does not depend on time), it silently passes and attempts to find another position vector that might allow for velocity calculation. If no such vector exists, it defaults to the original behavior of raising a `ValueError`. 

This solution aims to provide a more intuitive behavior for users expecting automatic velocity calculation based on position vectors, similar to how angular velocities are handled, while preserving the original error handling as a fallback.
