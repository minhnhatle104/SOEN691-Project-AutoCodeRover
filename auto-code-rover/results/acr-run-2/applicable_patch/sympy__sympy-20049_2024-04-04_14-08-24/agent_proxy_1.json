The information gathered provides a sufficient understanding of how the `ReferenceFrame` and `Point` classes work, as well as the specific methods (`vel`, `set_pos`, `orientnew`) involved in the issue. The next step would be to work on a solution based on this understanding.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n\nThe issue is not exactly a bug in the traditional sense but rather a feature enhancement or a missing functionality in the `sympy.physics.vector.point.py` file, specifically within the `Point` class and its `vel` method. The enhancement would involve allowing the `vel` method to calculate and return the velocity of a point based on the derivative of its position vector relative to another point when such velocity has not been explicitly defined."
