But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work. See below:\n```\nIn [1]: import sympy as sm\nIn [2]: import sympy.physics.mechanics as me\nIn [3]: A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')\nIn [5]: q = me.dynamicsymbols('q')\nIn [6]: B = A.orientnew('B', 'Axis', (q, A.x))\nIn [7]: B.ang_vel_in(A)\nOut[7]: q'*A.x\nIn [9]: P = me.Point('P')\nIn [10]: Q = me.Point('Q')\nIn [11]: r = q*A.x + 2*q*A.y\nIn [12]: Q.set_pos(P, r)\nIn [13]: Q.vel(A)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-13-0fc8041904cc> in <module>\n----> 1 Q.vel(A)\n~/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sympy/physics/vector/point.py in vel(self, frame)\n453         if not (frame in self._vel_dict):\n454             raise ValueError('Velocity of point ' + self.name + ' has not been'\n--> 455                              ' defined in ReferenceFrame ' + frame.name)\n456         return self._vel_dict[frame]\n457\nValueError: Velocity of point Q has not been defined in ReferenceFrame A\n```\nThe expected result of the `Q.vel(A)` should be:\n```\nIn [14]: r.dt(A)\nOut[14]: q'*A.x + 2*q'*A.y\n```\nI think that this is possible. Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\n</issue>"
