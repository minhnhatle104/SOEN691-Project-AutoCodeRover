However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n</issue>"

Given the description of the issue, it's clear that we're dealing with Django's admin framework, specifically the handling of Inline model admin classes. Here are the API calls that would be most relevant to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. **Search for the Inline class in the Django admin framework**: Since the issue is related to Inline classes in admin views, we first need to find the base class or classes that handle these functionalities. This will give us a starting point to understand how `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are currently implemented and where modifications might be necessary.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(class_name=\"InlineModelAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for methods that handle `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural`**: To understand how these properties are set and used, we need to find the methods within the Inline class or related classes that handle these attributes. This could include methods that initialize these properties or methods that render them in the admin interface.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(method_name=\"__init__\", class_name=\"InlineModelAdmin\")\n   search_method_in_class(method_name=\"get_verbose_name\", class_name=\"InlineModelAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for code snippets that reference `verbose_name_plural` without `verbose_name`**: Since the issue mentions that `verbose_name_plural` does not default to being based on `verbose_name` if specified, it would be useful to see if there are explicit references or checks that separate these two properties in a way that could be contributing to the issue.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(code_str=\"verbose_name_plural\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a comprehensive overview of how `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are handled within Django's InlineModelAdmin class and potentially related classes or methods. This information will be crucial for understanding the current implementation and for devising an appropriate patch to address the issue."

        "content": "Based on the information collected from the search API calls, let's analyze the context and findings to understand how to approach the issue of using `verbose_name` as the default for `verbose_name_plural` in Django admin Inline classes.\n\n### InlineModelAdmin Class\n\nThe `InlineModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` is where the handling of inline models in the Django admin is defined. This class has attributes for `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural`, which are initialized to `None`. During the initialization of an `InlineModelAdmin` instance (`__init__` method), if `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are not explicitly set, they default to the model's `_meta.verbose_name` and `_meta.verbose_name_plural`, respectively. This behavior is consistent with the issue description, where the `verbose_name_plural` does not automatically derive from the `verbose_name` if the latter is specified.\n\n### Method `__init__` in InlineModelAdmin\n\nThe `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin` sets `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` based on the model's meta options if they are not explicitly provided. This is a key area for implementing the proposed change. To address the issue, the logic here could be modified to set `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if it is specified, before falling back to the model's `_meta.verbose_name_plural`.\n\n### Search for `get_verbose_name`\n\nThe search for a method named `get_verbose_name` in `InlineModelAdmin` did not yield any results, indicating that there is no such method in the class that could be directly modified or extended to implement the desired behavior.\n\n### References to `verbose_name_plural`\n\nThe search for code snippets containing `verbose_name_plural` showed that it is used in various places across the Django codebase, including models, migrations, views, and tests. This widespread use underscores the importance of ensuring that any changes made to how `verbose_name_plural` is set or derived in `InlineModelAdmin` do not inadvertently affect other parts of Django.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nTo address the issue, the focus should be on modifying the `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin` to implement logic that sets `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if the latter is specified. This change should be carefully designed to avoid breaking existing functionality or expectations around the use of `verbose_name_plural`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to draft a patch that modifies the `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin` accordingly, and to write tests that verify the new behavior without negatively impacting other parts of Django. This patch should then be reviewed and tested in various scenarios to ensure compatibility and correctness."
