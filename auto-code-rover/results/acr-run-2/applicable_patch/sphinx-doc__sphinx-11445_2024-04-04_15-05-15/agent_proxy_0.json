            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how Sphinx processes the `rst_prolog` setting and how it affects the rendering of documents, especially those with domain directives as the first heading. The issue seems to be related to how Sphinx parses and includes headings in the toctree when `rst_prolog` is set. Given this context, we should look into the Sphinx codebase to find relevant classes and methods that handle `rst_prolog`, document rendering, and toctree inclusion.\n\nLet's start by investigating the following areas:\n1. How `rst_prolog` is processed and applied to documents.\n2. The mechanism Sphinx uses to parse headings and recognize domain directives.\n3. The logic that integrates headings into the toctree.\n\nBased on this, the following search API calls would be relevant:\n- `search_code(\"rst_prolog\")`: This will help us understand where and how `rst_prolog` is processed in the Sphinx codebase.\n- `search_method(\"parse_heading\")`: Assuming there's a method for parsing headings, this could give us insight into how Sphinx handles headings, including those with domain directives.\n- `search_method(\"toctree\")`: This could help us find the logic related to integrating headings into the toctree, which seems to be affected by the issue.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the problem and developing a patch."
