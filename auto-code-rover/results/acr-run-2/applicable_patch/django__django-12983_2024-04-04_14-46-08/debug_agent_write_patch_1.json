        "content": "Based on the search results, we have two instances of the `slugify` method within the Django codebase. One is located in `django/template/defaultfilters.py`, and the other, which is more relevant to the issue, is in `django/utils/text.py`. The issue specifically mentions `django.utils.text.slugify()`, so we'll focus on the second result.\n\nThe current implementation of `slugify` in `django/utils/text.py` does the following:\n1. Converts the input value to a string.\n2. Normalizes the string to either ASCII or Unicode, depending on the `allow_unicode` flag.\n3. Uses a regular expression to remove characters that are not alphanumerics, underscores, or hyphens, and converts the string to lowercase.\n4. Strips leading and trailing whitespace.\n5. Replaces sequences of hyphens or spaces with a single hyphen.\n\nThe issue reported is that the `slugify` method does not strip leading or trailing dashes and underscores from the resulting slug. The current implementation already strips leading and trailing whitespace but does not specifically address dashes and underscores.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to modify the `slugify` method to also strip leading and trailing dashes and underscores after the existing transformations are applied. This would ensure that the output matches the expected result of \"this-is-a-test\" when given the input \"___This is a test ---\". \n\nNext, we will draft a patch to solve this issue."
