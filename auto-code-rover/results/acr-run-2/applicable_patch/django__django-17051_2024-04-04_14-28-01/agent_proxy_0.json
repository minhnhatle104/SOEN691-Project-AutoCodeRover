            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation of `bulk_create` and how it handles `update_conflicts`. Specifically, we need to understand where `returning_fields` gets removed during the process, as mentioned in the issue description. The relevant parts of the Django source code to look into are the `bulk_create` method and the handling of `returning_fields` in the context of `update_conflicts`.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `bulk_create` method within the Django codebase to understand its implementation and parameters. Next, we will look for the code snippet that removes `returning_fields` to see how it's currently handled.\n\n1. `search_method(method_name: \"bulk_create\")` - This will help us find the implementation of `bulk_create` and understand its parameters and logic.\n\n2. `search_code(code_str: \"returning_fields gets removed\")` - Since the issue description mentions a specific part of the code where `returning_fields` gets removed, this search will help us locate that snippet for further analysis. \n\nThese searches should provide the necessary context to start working on a patch for the issue."
