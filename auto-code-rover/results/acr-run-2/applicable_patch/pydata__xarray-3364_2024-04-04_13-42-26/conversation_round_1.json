Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n</issue>"

Given that the issue specifically mentions the behavior of `xray.concat` in the context of concatenating datasets with different variables, it's likely that the implementation or the behavior that needs to be modified is located within these files.\n\nThe file `xarray/core/concat.py` seems particularly relevant because it might contain the primary implementation of the `concat` function as it relates to the concatenation of datasets. On the other hand, `xarray/core/variable.py` might contain lower-level details or utilities that are used by the `concat` function.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to understand how `concat` currently handles datasets with different variables and then propose a solution that allows it to gracefully handle such cases, possibly by introducing an option to ignore missing variables.\n\nThe next steps would involve looking into the implementation details of the `concat` method within these files to understand the current logic and identify where modifications are needed to introduce the desired behavior. This might include adding a new parameter to the `concat` method to control the handling of missing variables and implementing the logic to either include or ignore such variables based on this parameter.\n\nGiven this context, a deeper analysis of the `concat` method's implementation in `xarray/core/concat.py` would be the most logical next step."
