```

This patch addresses the issue by refining the handling of the `discrete_features` parameter in the `_estimate_mi` function. The first modification ensures that when `discrete_features` is not `'auto'`, it checks if it is a list or an array. If it is a boolean mask (with the same length as the number of features and of boolean type), it is used directly. If it is an array of indices, a new boolean mask is created accordingly. This approach ensures compatibility with different types of inputs for `discrete_features`. The second modification removes the now redundant code that was previously handling the `discrete_features` parameter in a less flexible manner.
