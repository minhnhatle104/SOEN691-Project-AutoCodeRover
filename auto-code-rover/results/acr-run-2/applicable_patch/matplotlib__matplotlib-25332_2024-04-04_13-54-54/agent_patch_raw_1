Given the information and the context of the issue, it seems that the problem might be related to the use of a data structure or mechanism (`self._align_label_groups['x'].join(ax, axc)` and `self._align_label_groups['y'].join(ax, axc)`) that is not directly pickleable due to the inclusion of weak references or similar non-pickleable objects. However, without direct access to the implementation of `_align_label_groups` and its `join` method, I'll propose a hypothetical patch that aims to ensure that objects involved in label alignment are pickleable. This patch assumes the existence of a custom implementation for grouping axes that might be using weak references or similar constructs that are not pickleable.

Please note, the actual implementation might differ, and without access to the complete codebase, especially the implementation details of `_align_label_groups` and its `join` method, this patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to solving the pickle issue.

This patch proposes a speculative solution where we replace or augment the existing mechanism for grouping axes with a more pickle-friendly approach, using a dictionary of sets. Each axis is keyed by itself, and the value is a set of axes it should be aligned with. This approach assumes that axes objects are pickleable themselves or have been made pickleable elsewhere in the codebase. 

Please note, this solution is speculative and based on the assumption that the issue lies with the grouping mechanism's compatibility with pickling. The actual implementation might require a different approach depending on the specifics of how `_align_label_groups` and its `join` method are implemented.
