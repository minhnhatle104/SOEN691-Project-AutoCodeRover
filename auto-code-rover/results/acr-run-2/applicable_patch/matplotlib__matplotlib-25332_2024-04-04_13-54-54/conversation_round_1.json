        "content": "Based on the provided information, the `align_labels` method is found within the `FigureBase` class in the `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` file. The purpose of this method is to align the xlabels and ylabels of subplots within the same row or column, respectively, if label alignment is being done automatically. This means that if the position of labels is not set manually, this method will ensure that labels across different subplots align with each other. It does so by potentially calling two other methods: `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels`, based on the axes provided as an argument or defaulting to align all Axes on the figure if no specific axes are provided.\n\nGiven the bug description, the issue arises when trying to pickle a figure after the `align_labels` method has been called. The error message indicates a `TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object`, which suggests that during the process of aligning labels, an object that cannot be pickled (likely due to the use of weak references) is being involved.\n\nTo further investigate and potentially patch this issue, we need to understand how `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` methods work, as they are called within `align_labels` and could be manipulating or creating objects that are not pickleable. Additionally, understanding the implementation of these methods might reveal why a `weakref.ReferenceType` object is involved in the process.\n\nNext steps for investigation could include:\n1. Examining the implementations of `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` methods to see how they handle label alignment and what objects they interact with.\n2. Identifying any use of weak references within these methods or any objects they manipulate that could lead to the pickle error.\n\nLet's proceed with examining the implementations of `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` methods."
