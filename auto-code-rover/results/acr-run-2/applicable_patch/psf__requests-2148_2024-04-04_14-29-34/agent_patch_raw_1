This modification adds an additional `except` block to catch `socket.error` exceptions during the content reading process in the `content` method of the `Response` class. When such an exception is caught, it is wrapped in a `ConnectionError`, providing a consistent interface for handling connection-related errors within the `requests` library. Note that the message `"A request object could be passed here if available"` is a placeholder; depending on the context in which the `content` method is called, it might be beneficial to pass the actual request object to the `ConnectionError` for more detailed debugging information.
