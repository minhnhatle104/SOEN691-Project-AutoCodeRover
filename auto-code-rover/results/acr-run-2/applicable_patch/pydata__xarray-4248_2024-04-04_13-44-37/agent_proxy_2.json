            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: \n\nGiven the analysis, we have a good understanding of where to start implementing the feature request. However, to precisely modify the dataset representation to include units, it would be beneficial to examine how units are stored within data variables and coordinates more closely. Specifically, understanding the structure of metadata where units are defined could guide the enhancement. Thus, a focused search on how units are accessed or stored, particularly in data variables and coordinates, would be beneficial. However, without the capability to execute more targeted and complex queries or inspect the code directly, we have reached the limit of what can be achieved through the provided search API calls.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: \n\nThis is not about fixing a bug but about enhancing the feature. The locations relevant to the feature enhancement are:\n\n1. **HTML Representation**:\n   - **File**: `xarray/core/formatting_html.py`\n   - **Method**: `dataset_repr`\n   - This file is responsible for generating the HTML representation of the dataset, which is used in Jupyter notebooks and possibly other web interfaces.\n\n2. **Plain Text Representation**:\n   - **File**: `xarray/core/formatting.py`\n   - **Method**: `dataset_repr`\n   - This file handles the generation of the plain text representation of the dataset, which appears in console outputs and logs.\n\nThese locations are where modifications are needed to include units in the dataset's representation. Further, a detailed examination of how units are represented within data variables and coordinates (likely within their attributes) across the xarray codebase would be necessary to implement this feature effectively."
