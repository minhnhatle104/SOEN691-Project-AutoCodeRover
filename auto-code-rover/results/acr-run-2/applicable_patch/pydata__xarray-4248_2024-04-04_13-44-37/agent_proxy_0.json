            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `Dataset` representation is generated in the codebase. This involves finding the method responsible for generating the string representation of a `Dataset` object, which typically involves a method like `__repr__` or a specifically designed method for pretty-printing the dataset's structure. Given the nature of the request, it's also possible that there's a dedicated method for formatting the dimensions, coordinates, and data variables sections of the dataset's representation.\n\nLet's start by searching for the class and methods that might be responsible for generating the dataset's representation:\n\n1. **Search for the Dataset class**: This will help us find the class definition and understand its structure and methods.\n   \n2. **Search for a `__repr__` method in the Dataset class**: The `__repr__` method is commonly used in Python to define how an object's printable representation is generated, which is likely involved in creating the dataset overview.\n\n3. **Search for any method related to formatting or representing the dataset**: Since the feature request involves adding units to the dataset's representation, there might be specific methods responsible for formatting the dimensions, coordinates, and data variables sections.\n\nBased on these considerations, the API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"Dataset\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"Dataset\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"format\", \"Dataset\")` (This is a more speculative search, assuming there might be a method with \"format\" in its name responsible for formatting parts of the dataset's representation.)"
