            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: Yes, to effectively implement the feature request, we need to examine the implementation of the `formatting.dataset_repr` function, as it is responsible for generating the string representation of a `Dataset` object. Additionally, understanding how units are stored and accessed for coordinates and data variables within a `Dataset` will be crucial. Therefore, the following search API calls are necessary:\n  - `search_method(\"dataset_repr\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the `dataset_repr` function to understand how the current representation is generated.\n  - `search_code(\"units\")`: Since we need to know how units are stored and accessed, searching for references to \"units\" within the codebase could provide insights into how units are associated with dimensions and data variables.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: Based on the current information, the feature request does not pertain to a bug but rather to an enhancement of the existing functionality. The relevant location for implementing this feature is within the file and method responsible for generating the dataset's string representation:\n  - **Buggy files and methods**: Not applicable in the context of a feature request. However, the focus for the enhancement is on:\n    - **File**: `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n    - **Method**: `__repr__` (indirectly, since it delegates to `formatting.dataset_repr`)"
