            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `simplify` and `evalf` methods work within the SymPy library, as these are the key functions involved in the problem described. The issue seems to arise when trying to simplify an expression that involves floating-point exponents and fractions. Let's gather more information about these methods and any related classes or methods that could be involved in this issue.\n\n1. `search_method(\"simplify\")`: This will help us understand how the `simplify` method is implemented and if there are any known limitations or bugs related to simplification of expressions with floating-point numbers or fractions as exponents.\n\n2. `search_method(\"evalf\")`: Since `evalf` is also used in the code snippet provided in the issue, understanding its implementation and interaction with `simplify` could provide insights into why the expression is not simplifying as expected.\n\n3. `search_class(\"Symbol\")`: Given that a `Symbol` is being used in the expression, it would be useful to understand if there are any specific behaviors or methods related to `Symbol` instances that could affect the simplification process.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."
