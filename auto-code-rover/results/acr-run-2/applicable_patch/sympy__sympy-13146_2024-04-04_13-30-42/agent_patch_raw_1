Explanation:
- The modifications aim to address the issue where expressions with floating-point exponents are not fully simplified by the `simplify` method in SymPy. 
- In modification 1, after the initial check to return the expression if it's not an instance of `Basic`, an additional step is introduced to check if the expression contains any power (`Pow`) with a real floating-point exponent. If such a case is found, `nsimplify` is used with the `rational=True` option to attempt converting floating-point numbers to rational numbers where possible, which can then be simplified more effectively.
- Modification 2 adds a similar check within the final decision-making process of whether to return the original expression or the simplified one. If the simplified expression is not significantly simpler than the original, or if there are floating-point exponents present, it attempts to apply `nsimplify` to the original expression to improve simplification.
- These modifications are designed to enhance the handling of expressions with floating-point exponents without disrupting the existing functionality for other types of expressions. The use of `nsimplify` with `rational=True` is a targeted approach to address the specific issue raised.
