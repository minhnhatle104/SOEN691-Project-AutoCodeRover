Given the constraints and the nature of the request, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the instructions for submitting a patch when the original code snippet is not applicable because the change involves adding new functionality rather than modifying existing code. Since the platform requires a non-whitespace original code snippet even when adding new functionality, let's reframe the submission to fit within the expected format, despite it not aligning perfectly with the nature of the change being proposed.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pycode.py</file>
<original>_print_lowergamma = CodePrinter._print_not_supported</original>
<patched>_print_lowergamma = CodePrinter._print_not_supported

    def _print_Tuple(self, expr):
        # New method to correctly print tuples, especially handling single-element tuples
        if len(expr) == 1:
            return '({},)'.format(', '.join(map(self._print, expr)))
        else:
            return '({})'.format(', '.join(map(self._print, expr)))
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a new method `_print_Tuple` immediately following the `_print_lowergamma` method as a placeholder to fit the format requirements. The new `_print_Tuple` method ensures that tuples, particularly those with a single element, are printed correctly by including a comma, thereby preserving their tuple nature in the generated Python code. This approach is a workaround to illustrate the intended change within the constraints provided.
