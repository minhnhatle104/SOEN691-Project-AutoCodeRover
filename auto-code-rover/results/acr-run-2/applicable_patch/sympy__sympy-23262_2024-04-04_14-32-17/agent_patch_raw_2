Since the original request was to add a new method to handle tuples, which did not exist in the provided context, the "original" section should be empty as it was a new addition rather than a modification of existing code. However, to adhere to the format and clarify the intention, I'll reformat the submission without specifying an "original" code snippet, as the addition is entirely new.

<patched>class PythonCodePrinter(AbstractPythonCodePrinter):

    ...

    def _print_Symbol(self, expr):
        name = super()._print_Symbol(expr)
        if name in self.reserved_words:
            if self._settings['error_on_reserved']:
                msg = ('This expression includes the symbol "{}" which is a '
                       'reserved keyword in this language.')
                raise ValueError(msg.format(name))
            return name + self._settings['reserved_word_suffix']
        elif '{' in name:   # Remove curly braces from subscripted variables
            return name.replace('{', '').replace('}', '')
        else:
            return name

    def _print_Tuple(self, expr):
        if len(expr) == 1:
            return '({},)'.format(', '.join(map(self._print, expr)))
        else:
            return '({})'.format(', '.join(map(self._print, expr)))

    _print_lowergamma = CodePrinter._print_not_supported
    _print_uppergamma = CodePrinter._print_not_supported
    _print_fresnelc = CodePrinter._print_not_supported
    _print_fresnels = CodePrinter._print_not_supported

This modification introduces a `_print_Tuple` method to the `PythonCodePrinter` class. This method checks the length of the tuple and ensures that a comma is included after the element if the tuple has only one element, thus preserving the tuple nature of the expression in the generated Python code.
