The issue suggests that `HttpResponse` does not correctly handle `memoryview` objects, resulting in an unexpected representation of the content. To gather more context and find a potential solution, we should look into the implementation of `HttpResponse` and how it processes the content provided to it.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the HttpResponse class**: This will help us understand the structure of the `HttpResponse` class and any relevant methods that handle the content.\n   - `search_class(\"HttpResponse\")`\n\n2. **Search for methods in the HttpResponse class that handle content**: Since the issue is related to how content is processed, we need to find methods within `HttpResponse` that are responsible for setting or modifying the content.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"content\", \"HttpResponse\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide insight into how `HttpResponse` is designed to handle content and whether there's a specific mechanism or method that fails to properly handle `memoryview` objects. With this information, we can then proceed to devise a patch or workaround."
