2024-04-04 14:00:33 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the collected context, we have the following information:\n\n1. **SimpleLazyObject** is defined in `django/utils/functional.py`. It inherits from `LazyObject` and implements several methods including `__init__`, `_setup`, `__repr__`, `__copy__`, and `__deepcopy__`. However, from the issue description, it\'s clear that `SimpleLazyObject` lacks implementation for several magic methods, specifically `__radd__`.\n\n2. **new_method_proxy** is also located in `django/utils/functional.py`. This function is designed to wrap a method so that it sets up the lazy object (if it hasn\'t been set up already) before calling the method on the wrapped object. This is a utility function that can be used to implement magic methods in lazy objects by delegating calls to the wrapped object.\n\nGiven this context, the issue with `SimpleLazyObject` not implementing `__radd__` can be approached by creating a new method in `SimpleLazyObject` that uses `new_method_proxy` to delegate the `__radd__` operation to the wrapped object. However, as noted in the issue description, a direct application of `new_method_proxy` with `operator.radd` or `operator.attrgetter("__radd__")` is not feasible due to limitations in those approaches.\n\nThe proposed minimal implementation provided in the issue description suggests directly implementing `__radd__` in `SimpleLazyObject` to manually handle the lazy setup and then perform the addition operation. This approach bypasses the need for `new_method_proxy` but still respects the lazy initialization pattern by ensuring `_setup` is called before attempting to use the wrapped object.\n\nTo proceed with a solution, we would need to integrate this `__radd__` implementation into `SimpleLazyObject`, ensuring it correctly handles the lazy setup and delegates the addition operation to the wrapped object. This would involve modifying the `SimpleLazyObject` class definition in `django/utils/functional.py`.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
