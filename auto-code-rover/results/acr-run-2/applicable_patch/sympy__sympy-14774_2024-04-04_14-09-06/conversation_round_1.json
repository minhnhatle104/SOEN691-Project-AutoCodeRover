        "content": "Based on the search result, the issue is located within the `LatexPrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, specifically in the `_print_Function` method. The code snippet provided shows the initialization of the `inv_trig_table` array, which is used to determine how inverse trigonometric functions are printed based on the `inv_trig_style` setting. The issue arises because the `inv_trig_table` does not include \"acsc\" and \"asec\", leading to inconsistent naming when the `inv_trig_style` is set to \"full\".\n\nTo address this issue, the proposed fix is to update the `inv_trig_table` array to include \"acsc\" and \"asec\". This change would ensure that when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is used, the `latex` function returns the expected full names for all inverse trigonometric functions, including `acsc` and `asec`.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the issue, the next steps would involve implementing the proposed fix and then testing to ensure that it resolves the issue without introducing any new problems."
