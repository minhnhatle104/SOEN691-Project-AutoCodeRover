Specifically, I will search for the `CoordSys3D`, `Del`, and the `pprint` function, as these are directly mentioned in the issue description. Additionally, I will look into the `init_printing` function since it's related to how the output is being formatted and might be affecting the display in the terminal. Here are the API calls I will make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CoordSys3D\")`: To understand how the `CoordSys3D` class is implemented and if there's anything related to the printing or representation of vectors that could cause the issue.\n2. `search_class(\"Del\")`: To get more information on the `Del` class, especially how it handles operations that might affect the output formatting.\n3. `search_method(\"pprint\")`: To investigate the `pprint` function, which is responsible for pretty-printing the output and could be where the bug originates.\n4. `search_method(\"init_printing\")`: To explore the `init_printing` function, which sets up the printing system in sympy and could influence how outputs are displayed in the terminal."
