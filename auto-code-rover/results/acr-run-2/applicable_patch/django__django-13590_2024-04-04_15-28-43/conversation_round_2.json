This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n</issue>"

The issue mentions a specific method and a process that leads to a TypeError when using named tuples as arguments to `__range` in queryset filters. The method in question is `resolve_lookup_value` within the `Query` class, which is part of Django's ORM layer.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls would be necessary to gather the required context to understand and eventually patch the issue:\n\n1. Search for the `Query` class to find its location and understand its structure:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Query\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class to find its implementation details:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"resolve_lookup_value\", \"Query\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to locate the source of the issue within the Django codebase, specifically focusing on how named tuples are handled when passed as arguments to the `__range` lookup. Understanding the implementation of `resolve_lookup_value` will be crucial for devising a patch that correctly expands the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple, as suggested in the issue description."

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the Django codebase, we can see how the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class is implemented. This method is crucial for understanding the issue at hand, which arises when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0 and involves named tuples used as arguments to `__range` causing errors.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the `resolve_lookup_value` method as found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`:\n\n```python\ndef resolve_lookup_value(self, value, can_reuse, allow_joins):\n    if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):\n        value = value.resolve_expression(\n            self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,\n        )\n    elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n        # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need\n        # to be resolved independently.\n        return type(value)(\n            self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n            for sub_value in value\n        )\n    return value\n```\n\nThe method checks if the `value` has a `resolve_expression` method and, if so, calls it. This part is not directly related to the issue. The relevant part for the issue is the `elif` block, where it checks if the `value` is an instance of `list` or `tuple`. If it is, the method attempts to reconstitute the iterable by calling `resolve_lookup_value` recursively on each element of the iterable and then tries to construct a new iterable of the same type with the resolved values.\n\nThe problem arises when `value` is a named tuple. The method attempts to create a new named tuple by passing an iterator (`self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins) for sub_value in value`) to the constructor of the named tuple. However, named tuples expect each field to be passed as a separate argument, not as a single iterator, leading to the error described in the issue: `TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'`.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `resolve_lookup_value` method to correctly handle named tuples by expanding the iterator into separate arguments when reconstructing the named tuple. This can be achieved using the `*` operator to unpack the iterator. Let's move on to drafting a patch for this issue."
