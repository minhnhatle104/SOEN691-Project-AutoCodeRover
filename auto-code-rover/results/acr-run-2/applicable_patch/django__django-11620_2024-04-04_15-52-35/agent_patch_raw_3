Given the constraints and the detailed context provided earlier, it's clear that a direct patch to address the issue as described cannot be accurately formulated without speculative changes. The core of the issue seems to revolve around enhancing the developer's experience by providing more informative error messages when `Http404` exceptions occur, especially in the context of custom path converters during development (`DEBUG=True`).

However, based on the understanding of Django's error handling mechanisms and the desire to improve the debugging experience, a speculative approach to address the user's concern could involve ensuring that `Http404` exceptions raised in custom path converters provide as much context as possible. This speculative patch would aim to enhance the `technical_404_response` to include more detailed debugging information if available.

Since the original request and the provided code snippets do not directly indicate a specific bug or a missing feature but rather a desire for enhanced functionality, the following is a conceptual patch that developers might consider implementing in their projects or as a proposal for Django's development:

```python
<file>django/core/handlers/exception.py</file>
<original>if isinstance(exc, Http404):
    if settings.DEBUG:
        response = debug.technical_404_response(request, exc)
    else:
        response = get_exception_response(request, get_resolver(get_urlconf()), 404, exc)</original>
<patched>if isinstance(exc, Http404):
    if settings.DEBUG:
        # Enhanced debug information could be included in the Http404 exception as additional arguments or via custom attributes.
        # This requires modifications where Http404 is raised to include more context.
        debug_info = getattr(exc, 'debug_info', {})
        response = debug.technical_404_response(request, exc, debug_info=debug_info)
    else:
        response = get_exception_response(request, get_resolver(get_urlconf()), 404, exc)</patched>
```

```python
<file>django/views/debug.py</file>
<original>def technical_404_response(request, exception):
    ...
    return HttpResponseNotFound(t.render(c), content_type='text/html')</original>
<patched>def technical_404_response(request, exception, debug_info=None):
    ...
    # Use debug_info to enhance the context if available
    if debug_info is not None:
        for key, value in debug_info.items():
            c[key] = value
    return HttpResponseNotFound(t.render(c), content_type='text/html')</patched>
```

This conceptual patch suggests modifying the `technical_404_response` function to accept an additional `debug_info` parameter, which could be a dictionary containing extra debugging information. The `response_for_exception` function in `exception.py` is also adjusted to pass this additional debugging information to `technical_404_response`, assuming that such information is attached to the `Http404` exception.

**Important Note**: This patch is speculative and conceptual. Implementing it would require changes in how `Http404` exceptions are raised throughout the Django project, including attaching additional debugging information where relevant. This approach aims to provide a starting point for enhancing error reporting in development environments but would need thorough testing and consideration before integration into a production codebase.
