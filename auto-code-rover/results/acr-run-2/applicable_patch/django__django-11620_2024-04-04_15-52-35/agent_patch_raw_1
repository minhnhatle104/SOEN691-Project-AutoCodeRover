Based on the issue description and the retrieved context, it seems the core of the problem is not necessarily in the handling of `Http404` exceptions themselves but rather in ensuring that when such exceptions are raised within a path converter's `to_python` method, they result in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`, as expected. Since the current implementation already attempts to handle `Http404` exceptions in a special way when `DEBUG` is `True`, the patch would need to ensure that this behavior is consistent and informative enough for development purposes.

However, without specific details on how the `Http404` exceptions are being raised and handled in the path converter's `to_python` method, and given the existing handling in `django/core/handlers/exception.py` and `django/views/debug.py`, a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without making assumptions about the project's structure and the nature of the bug.

A hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that `Http404` exceptions raised in path converters are correctly caught and processed by the existing exception handling mechanism, but without a clear indication that this mechanism is failing or needs adjustment, proposing a specific code change is speculative.

Given the information available, a general approach to addressing issues of this nature would involve:

1. Ensuring that `Http404` exceptions raised in custom path converters are correctly propagated up to the middleware layer where `response_for_exception` can catch and process them.
2. Verifying that the `DEBUG` setting is correctly configured and accessible at the points where these exceptions are handled.
3. Enhancing the technical response provided for `Http404` exceptions in debug mode to include more detailed information about the context in which the exception was raised, if necessary.

Without specific evidence of a bug in the provided code snippets or a clear description of a malfunction in the existing exception handling logic, creating a patch would require more detailed information about the issue encountered and the context in which it occurs.
