This patch modifies the `fit` method of the `VotingClassifier` class to iterate over the estimators and check if any of them is `None` before attempting to fit them with the provided `X`, `transformed_y`, and `sample_weight`. If an estimator is `None`, it is skipped. This approach ensures that the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fit'` is avoided by not attempting to call `fit` on a `NoneType` object. Additionally, it handles the case where `sample_weight` is provided by passing it to the `fit` method of estimators that support it, aligning with the original intent to support sample weights if all underlying estimators do.
