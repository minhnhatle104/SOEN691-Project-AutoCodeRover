```

This patch addresses the issue by explicitly checking if the `row_block` or `col_block` is not found, which would indicate an index out of bounds error. This additional check ensures that the method does not proceed with an invalid block index, potentially leading to incorrect element access. The original logic is preserved but enhanced with clearer handling of cases where the index falls outside the expected range, ensuring that the method behaves correctly even when indices could refer to elements in different blocks.
