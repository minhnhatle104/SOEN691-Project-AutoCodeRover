The error trace provides specific files and methods that are relevant to the issue. Here are the API calls we should make based on the information provided in the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the `MatAdd` class**: This will help us understand the structure of `MatAdd` objects and how they are supposed to work with `MatrixSymbol` objects.\n   \n2. **Search for the `_print_MatAdd` method in the `pretty.py` file**: Since the error occurs during pretty printing, understanding this method's implementation will be crucial to identifying why `sympify` is being incorrectly used.\n\n3. **Search for the `MatrixSymbol` class**: This will provide context on how `MatrixSymbol` objects are structured and how they might be interacting with `MatAdd` objects during the pretty printing process.\n\n4. **Search for the `sympify` method in the `sympify.py` file**: Understanding how `sympify` is implemented and intended to be used will help us identify why its current usage is causing an error.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"MatAdd\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"_print_MatAdd\", \"./sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")`\n- `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"sympify\", \"./sympy/core/sympify.py\")`"
