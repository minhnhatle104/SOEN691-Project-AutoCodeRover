Given the context and the analysis of the `col_insert` and `_eval_col_insert` methods, it appears that the implementation logically should work as intended for inserting columns into a matrix. The issue described does not clearly point to a bug within these methods based on their implementation. The unexpected behavior described in the issue might be due to a misunderstanding of how these methods are supposed to work or an edge case not covered by the current implementation.

However, without a clear bug to fix based on the provided code snippets and the described issue, suggesting a specific patch is challenging. The methods seem to correctly handle the insertion logic, including adjusting for the position and ensuring the matrices have matching row counts.

If there were a specific bug identified, such as an off-by-one error or incorrect handling of matrix dimensions, a patch would involve modifying the relevant lines of code to correct the logic. For example, if the issue were that the inserted columns overwrite existing columns when they shouldn't, the patch might involve adjusting how the new matrix dimensions are calculated or how existing matrix values are preserved during the insertion process.

Since no specific bug has been identified in the provided code snippets, here's a hypothetical patch format for a situation where a bug was found in the handling of matrix dimensions:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/common.py</file>
<original>
def _eval_col_insert(self, pos, other):
    cols = self.cols

    def entry(i, j):
        if j < pos:
            return self[i, j]
        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:
            return other[i, j - pos]
        return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]

    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,
                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))
</original>
<patched>
def _eval_col_insert(self, pos, other):
    cols = self.cols

    def entry(i, j):
        if j < pos:
            return self[i, j]
        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:
            return other[i, j - pos]
        elif j >= pos + other.cols:  # Adjusted condition to explicitly handle this case
            return self[i, j - other.cols]

    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,
                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))
</patched>
```

This hypothetical patch explicitly handles the case for `j >= pos + other.cols` to ensure clarity in the logic, even though the original logic might not be incorrect. It's important to note that this is a fabricated example and not a direct solution to the described issue, as the issue does not point to a specific flaw in the logic based on the provided information.
