Given the issue description, it's clear that the method is not inserting columns as expected, particularly in relation to the identity matrix and a matrix of ones. Let's start by finding where the `Matrix` class and the `col_insert` method are defined in the codebase.\n\n- `search_class(\"Matrix\")`: This will help us find the file or files where the `Matrix` class is defined.\n- `search_method(\"col_insert\")`: This will help us find all occurrences of the `col_insert` method in the codebase to understand how it's implemented and potentially identify where the issue might be."
