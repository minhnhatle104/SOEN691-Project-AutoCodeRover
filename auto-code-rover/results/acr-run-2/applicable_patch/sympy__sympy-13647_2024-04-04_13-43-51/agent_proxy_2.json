The issue described might not directly stem from a bug within these methods but could be related to how they are used or expected to behave in specific scenarios. Without an obvious bug in the provided implementation and based on the information at hand, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific location in the code that is definitively incorrect or buggy. Further investigation might require a deeper understanding of the context in which these methods are used or additional testing to replicate and diagnose the issue described."
