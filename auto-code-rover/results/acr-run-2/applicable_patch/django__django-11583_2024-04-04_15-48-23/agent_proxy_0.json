            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `StatReloader`, `Pathlib`, and the `os.readlink` function are being used within the Django project's autoreload mechanism. The error \"ValueError: embedded null byte\" suggests that there's an issue with how file paths are being resolved or read, particularly when `Pathlib`'s `resolve` method is involved. Given the stack trace and the description, we should focus on the following:\n\n1. How `StatReloader` is implemented and interacts with file paths.\n2. The usage of `Pathlib` within the autoreload mechanism, specifically the `resolve` method.\n3. The call to `os.readlink` within `Pathlib`, as this is where the error occurs.\n\nBased on this, the following API calls will be necessary to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"StatReloader\")`: To understand how `StatReloader` is implemented and possibly contributing to the issue.\n2. `search_method(\"resolve\")`: Since `resolve` is a method of `Pathlib`, this will help us understand how it's used across the project, especially in relation to file path resolution.\n3. `search_code(\"os.readlink\")`: This will help identify all usages of `os.readlink` in the project, which is directly related to the error.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how file paths are being handled and potentially lead to identifying the cause of the intermittent \"ValueError: embedded null byte\" error."
