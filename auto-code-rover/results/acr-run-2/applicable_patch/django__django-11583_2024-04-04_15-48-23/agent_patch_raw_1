Given the nature of the issue described, which involves intermittent failures due to "ValueError: embedded null byte" potentially when Django's `StatReloader` interacts with the filesystem, a direct patch to Django's codebase might not be straightforward without identifying the exact cause. However, based on the analysis and the information provided, a speculative approach to mitigate this issue could involve adding a safeguard in the `snapshot_files` method within the `StatReloader` class to skip files that cause issues due to embedded null bytes or other filesystem anomalies.

Since the error seems to stem from the interaction with the filesystem, particularly with how paths are resolved or read, and considering that the direct manipulation of file paths isn't evident in the Django code provided, the patch would aim to catch and log any `ValueError` exceptions that occur during the file snapshot process, preventing the autoreloader from crashing.

Please note, this is a speculative solution and might not address the root cause of the issue if it lies outside Django's code (e.g., in the specific environment setup or in external dependencies like `Pathlib`).

```python

            if file in seen_files:
                continue
            try:
                mtime = file.stat().st_mtime
            except OSError:
                # This is thrown when the file does not exist.
                continue
            seen_files.add(file)
            yield file, mtime

<patched>    def snapshot_files(self):
        # watched_files may produce duplicate paths if globs overlap.
        seen_files = set()
        for file in self.watched_files():
            if file in seen_files:
                continue
            try:
                mtime = file.stat().st_mtime
            except OSError:
                # This is thrown when the file does not exist.
                continue
            except ValueError as e:
                # Catch ValueError which can be caused by "embedded null byte" issue.
                logger.error(f"Error reading file {file}: {e}")
                continue
            seen_files.add(file)
            yield file, mtime
</patched>
```

This patch adds an additional `except` block to catch `ValueError` exceptions, which might be thrown due to issues like embedded null bytes in file paths. It logs the error and continues with the next file, preventing the entire autoreload process from failing. This approach ensures that the autoreload feature remains robust against unexpected filesystem anomalies while providing visibility into the errors encountered.

Remember, this patch is based on the assumption that catching and logging the specific error can mitigate the issue without addressing the root cause, which might require further investigation into the environment or the specifics of the filesystem interaction.
