Henceforth, selecting a new data point will trigger the same traceback. Otherwise, it works fine.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport mplcursors as mpl\nx = np.arange(1, 11)\ny1 = x\nplt.scatter(x,y1)\nmpl.cursor()\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cbook\\__init__.py\", line 304, in process\nfunc(*args, **kwargs)\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1550, in on_release\nif self._check_still_parented() and self.got_artist:\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1560, in _check_still_parented\nself.disconnect()\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1568, in disconnect\nself.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1517, in <lambda>\ncanvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'\n```\n### Expected outcome\nNo terminal output\n### Additional information\nUsing matplotlib 3.7.0 or lower works fine.

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand the context around the `AttributeError` and the code paths involved in the traceback. The error message points to several methods and properties within the `matplotlib` library, specifically within the `offsetbox.py` file and related to the handling of canvas disconnection and artist checking.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls would be beneficial to gather more context about the bug:\n\n1. **Search for the class where the error occurs**: Since the error traceback mentions `matplotlib.offsetbox`, it's likely that the issue is within a class in this module. However, the traceback does not specify a class name directly but mentions methods and properties. We can start by examining the `disconnect` method and the `canvas` property in the `offsetbox.py` file.\n\n2. **Search for methods and properties involved in the traceback**:\n    - The `disconnect` method and the lambda function accessing `self.ref_artist.figure.canvas` are directly mentioned in the traceback. Investigating these will provide insight into how the `NoneType` object is encountered.\n    - The `on_release` method is also part of the traceback, indicating it might be involved in the event that leads to the error.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"disconnect\", \"matplotlib/offsetbox.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas\", \"matplotlib/offsetbox.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"on_release\", \"matplotlib/offsetbox.py\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate the exact points in the code where the error originates and understand the logic that leads to the `AttributeError`."

        "content": "Based on the search results from the `matplotlib/offsetbox.py` file, we can analyze the context around the `AttributeError` encountered in the issue. The relevant pieces of code are within the `DraggableBase` class and pertain to the `disconnect` and `on_release` methods, as well as a lambda function defining a `canvas` property.\n\n1. **`disconnect` method**:\n   - The `disconnect` method is designed to disconnect callbacks. It iterates over `self.cids`, calling `self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)` for each. Additionally, it attempts to access an attribute `self._c1` and, if present, calls `mpl_disconnect` on it as well.\n   - This method does not directly throw the `AttributeError`, but it's involved in the process of disconnecting event callbacks, which is relevant to the issue.\n\n2. **`canvas` property**:\n   - The `canvas` property is defined using a lambda function that returns `self.ref_artist.figure.canvas`. This property is crucial because the `AttributeError` specifically mentions that a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'`. This suggests that either `self.ref_artist` or `self.ref_artist.figure` is `None` at the time this property is accessed.\n   - The property is designed to be picklable, which is why it's defined in this manner. However, the issue arises when the `ref_artist` or its `figure` is not properly referenced.\n\n3. **`on_release` method**:\n   - The `on_release` method checks if the draggable object is still parented and if it has an artist. If both conditions are true, it finalizes the offset, sets `got_artist` to `False`, and disconnects a callback using `self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self._c1)`.\n   - This method directly interacts with the `canvas` and attempts to disconnect callbacks, which is relevant to the traceback seen in the issue.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nThe issue arises when the `canvas` property is accessed, and either `self.ref_artist` or `self.ref_artist.figure` is `None`, leading to the `AttributeError`. This could happen if the artist or figure is somehow dereferenced or not properly set up before these methods are called. The `on_release` method's logic, which involves checking for the artist's presence and disconnecting callbacks, might be a part of the sequence leading to the error, especially if it's called in a state where the artist or figure has been cleared or not yet initialized.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that:\n- The `canvas` property access is safeguarded against `None` values.\n- The `on_release` and `disconnect` methods handle cases where the artist or figure might not be fully initialized or has been dereferenced.\n\nA patch would likely involve adding checks to ensure `self.ref_artist` and `self.ref_artist.figure` are not `None` before accessing their `canvas` property, and similarly ensuring that callback disconnection logic accounts for potential `None` states."
