These modifications aim to address the issue by providing a fallback mechanism in `format_cursor_data` when the `inverse` method is not available or applicable, and by offering an approximate inverse function in `BoundaryNorm` to prevent crashes during user interaction. The approximation in `BoundaryNorm.inverse` is a basic implementation and might need further refinement based on the specific requirements and expected behavior.
