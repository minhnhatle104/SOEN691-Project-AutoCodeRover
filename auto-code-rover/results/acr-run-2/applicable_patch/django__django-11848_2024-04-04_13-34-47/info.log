The function is designed to parse dates formatted according to HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1, which allows three different date formats. The critical part of the issue lies in how two-digit years are handled within the date parsing logic.\n\nThe current implementation uses a simple heuristic to decide the century of a year when only two digits are provided:\n- If the year is less than 70, it assumes the year is in the 21st century (2000-2069).\n- If the year is between 70 and 99, it assumes the year is in the 20th century (1970-1999).\n\nThis approach is hardcoded and does not align with the guidance provided in RFC 7231 (and similarly in RFC 2822), which suggests that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\n\nTo address this issue, the logic for determining the century of a two-digit year needs to be updated to dynamically compare the two-digit year against the current year, rather than relying on a static range. This would involve calculating the current year at runtime and determining whether the two-digit year, when interpreted as being in the 20th or 21st century, would appear to be more than 50 years in the future. If so, the year should be adjusted to represent the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the year determination logic within the `parse_http_date` function to adhere to the specifications outlined in RFC 7231. This would ensure that the function correctly interprets two-digit years in a way that is compliant with modern standards and expectations.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
