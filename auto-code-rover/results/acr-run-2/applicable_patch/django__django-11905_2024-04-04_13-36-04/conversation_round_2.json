        "content": "Based on the search results, it's clear that `__isnull` is widely used across the Django project, particularly in model querying and filtering functionalities. The presence of `__isnull` in both core Django files (like those in `django/db/models/`) and in a wide range of test files suggests that it's a fundamental part of Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, used for generating database queries that check for NULL values in database fields.\n\nGiven the widespread use of `__isnull` and the issue's focus on preventing its use with non-boolean values, the next steps involve:\n\n1. **Understanding `__isnull` Implementation and Usage**: Since `__isnull` is not a standalone method but likely a part of Django's query construction mechanism, we need to understand how it's implemented. This involves looking into the files where `__isnull` is used, especially in core Django files like `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which are likely to contain the logic for interpreting `__isnull` in query construction.\n\n2. **Identifying Validation Points**: We need to identify where the validation for `__isnull` values can be added. This could be at the point where query parameters are processed or where the query is constructed. The goal is to catch instances where `__isnull` is used with non-boolean values and raise an error.\n\n3. **Reviewing Test Coverage**: Given the issue's mention of the behavior being undocumented and untested, part of the solution will involve adding tests that cover the new validation logic. This ensures that the change does not introduce regressions and that the expected behavior (raising an error for non-boolean values) is correctly implemented.\n\nTo proceed with the analysis, we should focus on the core implementation files and potentially the admin files, as these are likely places where the logic and validation can be added or modified. Specifically, looking into `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` would be a good starting point to understand how `__isnull` is processed in Django's ORM layer. Additionally, reviewing how `__isnull` is tested in various test files can provide insights into current test coverage and where new tests should be added.\n\nGiven the broad scope of the search results, a detailed analysis of each file might not be feasible in this format. However, focusing on the core implementation files will provide the necessary context to address the issue effectively."

        "content": "The search results provide specific instances where `__isnull` is used within the Django ORM layer, specifically in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. These instances give us valuable insights into how `__isnull` is currently implemented and where we might introduce validation to ensure it only accepts boolean values.\n\n### Analysis of `django/db/models/query.py`\n\nIn `django/db/models/query.py`, `__isnull` is used within the `dates` and `datetimes` methods of the `QuerySet` class. Both methods use `__isnull` in a filter to ensure that only non-null values of date fields (`datefield` and `datetimefield`) are considered. This usage is consistent and does not directly indicate a bug but shows how `__isnull` is applied in filtering query sets.\n\n### Analysis of `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n\nIn `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the `split_exclude` method of the `Query` class includes logic that builds a filter using `__isnull`. This part of the code adds a condition to a query that checks if a field is null, specifically in the context of handling 'left outer joins' in SQL queries. This usage is more technical and closer to the query construction process, making it a potential location for introducing validation for `__isnull` values.\n\n### Conclusions and Next Steps\n\nBased on the collected context:\n\n- **Bug Locations**: While the snippets themselves do not directly show buggy behavior, they highlight where `__isnull` is actively used in query construction and filtering. The actual bug, as described in the issue, would be the lack of validation for the values passed to `__isnull` lookups. Therefore, the locations to introduce fixes would be around the areas where these filters are constructed or processed, potentially in the methods mentioned above or in the underlying mechanisms that interpret these lookups.\n\n- **Validation Implementation**: To address the issue, we need to implement validation that ensures only boolean values are passed to `__isnull` lookups. This could involve modifying the logic in the `QuerySet` methods (`dates` and `datetimes`) and the `Query` method (`split_exclude`) to introduce checks before the filters are applied. Alternatively, a more centralized approach could involve adjusting the ORM's filter construction logic to enforce this validation across all uses of `__isnull`.\n\n- **Testing**: Given the issue's mention of the behavior being undocumented and untested, adding comprehensive tests to verify that an error is raised when non-boolean values are used with `__isnull` is crucial. This would involve modifying existing tests or adding new ones in the files related to querying and filtering, such as those in the `tests/queries/` directory.\n\nIn summary, while the exact bug locations in terms of where to add the validation are not explicitly detailed in the snippets, they guide us towards the relevant parts of the Django ORM where such validation could logically be implemented. The next step would involve modifying the identified methods or the underlying query construction logic to enforce boolean-only values for `__isnull` lookups and ensuring this behavior is well-tested."
