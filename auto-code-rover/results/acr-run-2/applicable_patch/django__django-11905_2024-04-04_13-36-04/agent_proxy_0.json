Given the description, `__isnull` seems to be a lookup mechanism, possibly related to database query construction or filtering. The goal is to ensure it only accepts boolean values to prevent unintended behavior or confusion.\n\nTo get started, we should look for the implementation of `__isnull` and any related validation or usage patterns. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"__isnull\")`: This will help us find where the `__isnull` method is defined or used across the entire codebase.\n2. `search_code(\"__isnull\")`: This will provide broader context by finding code snippets where `__isnull` is mentioned, which might include places where it's used in a way that doesn't directly call a method (e.g., as part of a query string or parameter).\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand how `__isnull` is integrated into the project and where we might need to introduce validation to enforce the use of boolean values only."
