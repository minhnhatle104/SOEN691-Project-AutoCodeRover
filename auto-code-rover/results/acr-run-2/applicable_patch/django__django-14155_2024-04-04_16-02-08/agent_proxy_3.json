However, based on the information we've gathered and analyzed:\n\n- The bug is indeed located within the `__repr__` method of the `ResolverMatch` class. This method is responsible for generating a string representation of a `ResolverMatch` instance, but it does not currently handle `functools.partial` objects in a way that reveals the underlying function or the arguments provided to it.\n\n- The specific file containing this bug is `django/urls/resolvers.py`.\n\nGiven this understanding, the location of the bug seems to be accurately identified based on the information available. However, to address the request for precision or additional context, no further search API calls seem necessary at this point since the issue revolves around enhancing the `__repr__` method to better handle `functools.partial` objects. The next step would be to propose a solution or patch for this issue."
