        "content": "Based on the information collected, we have identified the `ResolverMatch` class within the Django framework, located in `django/urls/resolvers.py`. This class includes several methods, including `__init__`, `__getitem__`, and `__repr__`. The issue at hand concerns the `__repr__` method and its handling of `functools.partial` objects. Specifically, when a partial function is passed as the view, the `__repr__` method does not display helpful information about the underlying function or the arguments provided to the partial.\n\nGiven the issue description and the location of the `ResolverMatch` class, the next step is to improve the `__repr__` method to handle `functools.partial` objects more effectively. This will likely involve unwrapping the `functools.partial` object to access and display the underlying function and its arguments within the `__repr__` output.\n\nTo proceed, we need to review the current implementation of the `__repr__` method in the `ResolverMatch` class to understand how it currently represents objects and to identify where modifications are needed to support `functools.partial` objects appropriately. Let's search for the implementation of the `__repr__` method within the `ResolverMatch` class for further analysis."
