This class includes several methods, including `__init__`, `__getitem__`, and `__repr__`. The issue at hand concerns the `__repr__` method and its handling of `functools.partial` objects. Specifically, when a partial function is passed as the view, the `__repr__` method does not display helpful information about the underlying function or the arguments provided to the partial.\n\nGiven the issue description and the location of the `ResolverMatch` class, the next step is to improve the `__repr__` method to handle `functools.partial` objects more effectively. This will likely involve unwrapping the `functools.partial` object to access and display the underlying function and its arguments within the `__repr__` output.\n\nTo proceed, we need to review the current implementation of the `__repr__` method in the `ResolverMatch` class to understand how it currently represents objects and to identify where modifications are needed to support `functools.partial` objects appropriately. Let's search for the implementation of the `__repr__` method within the `ResolverMatch` class for further analysis."

It includes various attributes such as `func`, `args`, `kwargs`, `url_name`, `app_names`, `namespaces`, and `route`. The representation of the `func` attribute is derived from `self._func_path`, which suggests that it might not be handling `functools.partial` objects in a way that reveals the underlying function or the arguments provided to it.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem arises when the `func` attribute is a `functools.partial` object. The current implementation does not unwrap these objects to display the underlying function or its provided arguments, which results in a less informative `__repr__` output for instances of `ResolverMatch` where the view function is a partial.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to enhance the `__repr__` method to check if `self._func_path` (or the actual function it represents) is a `functools.partial` object. If it is, we should unwrap it to get the underlying function's name and the arguments provided to the partial. This enhancement will make the `__repr__` output more informative and useful, especially for debugging purposes.\n\nThe bug location is clearly in the `__repr__` method of the `ResolverMatch` class within the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file. The next step is to draft a patch that modifies this method to handle `functools.partial` objects appropriately."
