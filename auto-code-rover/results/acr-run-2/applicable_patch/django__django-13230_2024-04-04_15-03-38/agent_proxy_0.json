Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"add_item\", \"feed\")` - This will help understand how items are currently added to the feed and what parameters it accepts.\n2. `search_code(\"item_extra_kwargs\")` - Since the issue mentions taking a detour via `item_extra_kwargs` to define `item_comments`, understanding how `item_extra_kwargs` is used will be crucial.\n3. `search_code(\"feedparser\")` - To see how `comments` are mentioned in the feedparser, which could give insights into how it's expected to be implemented in the view."
