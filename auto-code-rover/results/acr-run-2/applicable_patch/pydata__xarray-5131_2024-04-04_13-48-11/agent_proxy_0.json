This involves locating the method responsible for generating the string representation, which is typically `__str__` or `__repr__` in Python classes. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that the class `DatasetGroupBy` or a related method is where the trailing whitespace is introduced.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be necessary to gather more context and potentially identify the source of the bug:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")`: This will help us find the file and location where the `DatasetGroupBy` class is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`: Since the issue is related to the string representation, this call will help us find if there's a custom `__str__` method in the `DatasetGroupBy` class that might be adding the trailing whitespace.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`: Similarly, if the `__str__` method does not directly cause the issue, the `__repr__` method (which is another common method used for object representation) might be the culprit.\n\nThese calls should provide sufficient information to identify where the trailing whitespace is being introduced in the `DatasetGroupBy` text representation."
