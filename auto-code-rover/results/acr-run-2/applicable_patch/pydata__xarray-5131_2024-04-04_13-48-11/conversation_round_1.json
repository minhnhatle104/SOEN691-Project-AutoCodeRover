        "content": "<issue>Trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy text representation\nWhen displaying a DatasetGroupBy in an interactive Python session, the first line of output contains a trailing whitespace. The first example in the documentation demonstrate this:\n```pycon\n>>> import xarray as xr, numpy as np\n>>> ds = xr.Dataset(\n...     {\"foo\": ((\"x\", \"y\"), np.random.rand(4, 3))},\n...     coords={\"x\": [10, 20, 30, 40], \"letters\": (\"x\", list(\"abba\"))},\n... )\n>>> ds.groupby(\"letters\")\nDatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters'\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\n```\nThere is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output which is \"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \". This can be seen more clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before `\\n`):\n```pycon\n>>> str(ds.groupby(\"letters\"))\n\"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\"\n```\nWhile this isn't a problem in itself, it causes an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code is correctly formatted and we also have doctests that rely on DatasetGroupBy textual representation. Flake8 reports a violation on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctests fail because the expected output doesn't match the actual output. So we have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable. Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctest want the expected output to be exactly the same as the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference. We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violation for the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunately it's not possible to just add `# NoQA` comments to get flake8 to ignore the violation only for specific lines because that creates a difference between expected and actual output from doctest point of view. Flake8 doesn't allow to disable checks for blocks of code either.\nIs there a reason for having this trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy representation? Whould it be OK to remove it? If so please let me know and I can make a pull request.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, there are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The `DatasetGroupBy` class is defined in `xarray/core/groupby.py`. This class inherits from `GroupBy` and implements additional functionality specific to dataset grouping in xarray. The methods listed (`map`, `apply`, `_combine`, `reduce`, `assign`) are primarily focused on data manipulation and do not directly pertain to the issue at hand, which is related to the string representation of `DatasetGroupBy` objects.\n\n2. **String Representation Methods**: Neither a custom `__str__` nor a `__repr__` method was found in the `DatasetGroupBy` class. This suggests that the string representation might be inherited from a parent class or is being affected by another mechanism not directly defined within `DatasetGroupBy`.\n\nGiven these observations, the next steps in diagnosing the issue should involve:\n\n- Investigating the parent class `GroupBy` to see if the string representation is defined there, which could be responsible for the trailing whitespace.\n- Since neither `__str__` nor `__repr__` were overridden in `DatasetGroupBy`, it's possible that the representation is handled by a method that formats the output string for both `DatasetGroupBy` and possibly other related classes.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into the `GroupBy` class to understand how it handles string representations, which might indirectly affect `DatasetGroupBy`:\n\n1. **Search for the `GroupBy` class definition**: This will help determine if the string representation is being defined or modified in the parent class.\n2. **Search for any method in `DatasetGroupBy` or `GroupBy` that might be responsible for generating the textual representation**: Since the standard `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are not overridden in `DatasetGroupBy`, there might be another method involved in generating the output that includes the trailing whitespace.\n\nGiven the current context, the next logical step would be to search for the `GroupBy` class to see if it provides any clues:\n\n- `search_class(\"GroupBy\")`\n\nAdditionally, considering the possibility of an indirect method affecting the representation, we should also look for any method that could be formatting the output string:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"format\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"format\", \"GroupBy\")`\n\nThese steps should help us get closer to identifying the source of the trailing whitespace in the `DatasetGroupBy` text representation."
