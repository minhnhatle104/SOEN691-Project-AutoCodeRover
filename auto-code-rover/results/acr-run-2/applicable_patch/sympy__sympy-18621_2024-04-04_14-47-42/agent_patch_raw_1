```

This patch addresses the issue where a 'One' object is not subscriptable by checking if the block is an instance of `ZeroMatrix` and returning 0 directly if so. This avoids attempting to subscript a 'One' object, which was the cause of the TypeError in the original issue. The patch assumes that the error occurs when trying to access elements in a `ZeroMatrix` block, which is consistent with the description of the problem. If the 'One' object mentioned in the traceback refers to a different scenario not covered by the provided code snippets, further adjustments may be needed.
