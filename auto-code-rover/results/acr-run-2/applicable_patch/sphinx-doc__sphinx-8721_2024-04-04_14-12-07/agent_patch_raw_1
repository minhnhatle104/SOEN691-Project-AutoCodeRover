```python
<file>sphinx/ext/viewcode.py</file>
<original>if app.builder.name.startswith("epub") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
        return</original>
<patched>if "epub" in app.builder.format and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
        return</patched>
```

Explanation:
The original code checks if the builder's name starts with "epub" to decide whether to skip generating viewcode pages based on the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting. However, this approach might not correctly identify all epub-related build processes, especially if the naming convention changes or if there are multiple epub builders with different names not strictly starting with "epub".

The patched version changes the condition to check if "epub" is part of the builder's format instead of relying on the builder's name to start with "epub". This approach is more robust and flexible, ensuring that the check correctly identifies all epub-related build processes regardless of specific naming conventions. This change should prevent the generation of viewcode pages for epub when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`, addressing the issue described.
