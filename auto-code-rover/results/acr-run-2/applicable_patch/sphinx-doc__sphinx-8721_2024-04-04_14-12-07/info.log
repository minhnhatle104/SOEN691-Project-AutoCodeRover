2024-04-04 14:13:02 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the search results, we have some valuable insights into how the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting is implemented and potentially where the issue might be arising from. Let\'s break down the findings:\n\n1. **`viewcode.py` Implementation Details**:\n   - The `doctree_read` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` contains a conditional check that specifically looks for the builder\'s name. If the builder\'s name starts with "epub" and `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`, the function returns early, effectively skipping whatever processing it does. This is likely intended to prevent the generation of viewcode pages for epub when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.\n   - The `setup` function in the same file shows that `viewcode_enable_epub` is added as a configuration value with a default of `False`. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue, where viewcode pages should not be created for epub by default.\n\n2. **Testing for `viewcode_enable_epub`**:\n   - In `tests/test_ext_viewcode.py`, there\'s a test case specifically designed to test the behavior when `viewcode_enable_epub` is enabled (`True`). This indicates that there is some testing around this functionality, but the issue might be arising in scenarios not covered by the tests.\n\n3. **Lack of Direct References to Build Process for `html` and `epub`**:\n   - The search for methods related to the `make html epub` command and for code related to generating epub pages did not yield results. This suggests that the issue might not be directly related to specific methods or code explicitly named after these processes but rather to how the Sphinx build process interacts with the `viewcode` extension and its settings.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to be correctly identified in the `doctree_read` function where the check for `viewcode_enable_epub` is made. However, despite this check, users are reporting that viewcode pages are still being generated for epub outputs. This discrepancy suggests that there might be a gap in how the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting is applied or a misunderstanding of how the build process should respect this setting.\n\nThe next steps would involve:\n- Reviewing the `doctree_read` function and any related processing to ensure that the early return when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False` effectively prevents all viewcode page generation for epub.\n- Investigating how the Sphinx build process for epub might bypass or not fully respect the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting.\n- Considering the possibility of edge cases or configurations that might lead to the observed behavior, potentially outside of the direct `viewcode` extension logic.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

2024-04-04 14:13:18 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='# modification 1\n```python\n<file>sphinx/ext/viewcode.py</file>\n<original>if app.builder.name.startswith("epub") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:\n        return</original>\n<patched>if "epub" in app.builder.format and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:\n        return</patched>\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe original code checks if the builder\'s name starts with "epub" to decide whether to skip generating viewcode pages based on the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting. However, this approach might not correctly identify all epub-related build processes, especially if the naming convention changes or if there are multiple epub builders with different names not strictly starting with "epub".\n\nThe patched version changes the condition to check if "epub" is part of the builder\'s format instead of relying on the builder\'s name to start with "epub". This approach is more robust and flexible, ensuring that the check correctly identifies all epub-related build processes regardless of specific naming conventions. This change should prevent the generation of viewcode pages for epub when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`, addressing the issue described.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
