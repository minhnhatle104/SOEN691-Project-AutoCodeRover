These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that setting the visibility of a 3D axes object (`Axes3D`) through `set_visible` or `set_frame_on` methods affects not only the frame but also the contents within the axes. The first modification enhances the `set_frame_on` method to adjust the visibility of all child artists when the frame's visibility is changed. The second modification introduces a new `set_visible` method to `Axes3D` that overrides the inherited behavior from `Artist`, ensuring that visibility settings are propagated to both the frame and its contents. This approach should resolve the reported issue by providing consistent and expected behavior when toggling visibility in 3D plots.
