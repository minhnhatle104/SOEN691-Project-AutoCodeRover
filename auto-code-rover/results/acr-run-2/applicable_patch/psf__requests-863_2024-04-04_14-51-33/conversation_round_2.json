If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the `Request` class, its `__init__` method, and the `register_hook` method, we can deduce the following relevant points related to the issue:\n\n1. **Location and Structure of `Request` Class**:\n   - The `Request` class is defined in `requests/models.py`.\n   - The class includes an `__init__` method where various parameters are initialized, including `hooks`.\n   - The `hooks` parameter is intended to be a dictionary where each key represents an event, and the value is expected to be a function (or a list of functions based on the issue description) that acts as the hook for that event.\n\n2. **Initialization of Hooks in `__init__` Method**:\n   - During the initialization of a `Request` object, the `hooks` parameter is initially set to an empty dictionary.\n   - For each predefined event in `HOOKS`, an empty list is assigned to the event key in the `hooks` dictionary.\n   - The `hooks` argument passed to the `__init__` method is then processed. If provided, it iterates over its items and calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair.\n\n3. **`register_hook` Method**:\n   - The `register_hook` method takes an `event` and a `hook` as arguments.\n   - It appends the `hook` to the list of hooks associated with the given `event` in the `self.hooks` dictionary.\n   - This method assumes that each event key in `self.hooks` is associated with a list, to which it appends the new hook.\n\n**Issue Summary**:\nThe issue arises when the `hooks` argument passed to the `Request` class `__init__` method contains a list of functions for a single event. The current implementation of the `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method does not support directly assigning a list of functions to an event. Instead, it treats the list as a single hook, leading to errors when the hooks are consumed, as a list is not callable.\n\n**Solution Approach**:\nTo resolve this issue, modifications are needed in how the `hooks` argument is processed in the `__init__` method and possibly in how the `register_hook` method handles adding hooks. The goal is to allow a list of functions to be assigned as hooks for a single event, enabling the registration of multiple hooks for the same event directly through the `hooks` argument of the `Request` class constructor."

The way the `hooks` argument is processed needs to be modified to support lists of functions for each event.\n  - **Method**: `register_hook` of the `Request` class.
