Let's start by searching for these components:\n\n1. Search for the `Request` class to understand its structure and find the file it's located in.\n2. Search for the `register_hook` method within the `Request` class to understand how it currently registers hooks.\n3. Search for the `__init__` method within the `Request` class to see how the `hooks` argument is processed during object initialization.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Request\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"register_hook\", \"Request\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Request\")\n```"
