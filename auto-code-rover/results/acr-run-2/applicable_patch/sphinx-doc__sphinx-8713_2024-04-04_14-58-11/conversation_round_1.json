The provided code snippets indicate that the behavior of these sections is controlled by methods within a class, likely related to parsing and formatting docstrings in the NumpyDoc format.\n\nTo gather more context and potentially identify where the bug might be fixed, we should look into the following:\n\n1. The class that contains the `_parse_other_parameters_section` and `_parse_parameters_section` methods. Since the issue doesn't specify the class name directly, but it's clear these methods are part of the same class, we can infer they belong to the `NumpyDocstring` class based on the usage example provided in the issue description.\n\n2. The implementation of the `napoleon_use_param` configuration option to understand how it's supposed to affect the rendering of parameters.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. `search_class(\"NumpyDocstring\")`: To find the class definition and potentially other relevant methods or configurations.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_parse_other_parameters_section\", \"NumpyDocstring\")`: To get more context on how the \"Other Parameters\" section is currently parsed and formatted.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_parse_parameters_section\", \"NumpyDocstring\")`: To understand how the \"Parameters\" section is handled and how the `napoleon_use_param` configuration is applied.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the current implementation and identifying where changes might be needed to address the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have found the `NumpyDocstring` class within the `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py` file. This class is responsible for parsing and formatting docstrings according to the NumpyDoc style, which is part of the Sphinx `napoleon` extension. The `NumpyDocstring` class contains various methods for parsing different sections of a docstring, such as returns sections, see also sections, and potentially parameters sections, although the specific methods mentioned in the issue (`_parse_other_parameters_section` and `_parse_parameters_section`) were not found in the search results.\n\nGiven this information, there are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Location of Methods**: The methods `_parse_other_parameters_section` and `_parse_parameters_section` were not found in the search results. This could mean that the methods have been renamed, moved, or the search did not correctly identify them due to limitations or inaccuracies in the search API.\n\n2. **Class Responsibilities**: The `NumpyDocstring` class is clearly responsible for handling the parsing and formatting of Numpy-style docstrings. Understanding its structure and methods is crucial for addressing the issue at hand.\n\n3. **Configuration Handling**: The issue mentions a configuration option `napoleon_use_param` that affects how parameters are rendered. However, details on how this configuration is implemented or used within the `NumpyDocstring` class or its methods were not found in the search results. Understanding how configuration options are applied in this class is essential for proposing a solution.\n\nGiven the missing information from the search results, the next steps could involve:\n\n- Manually inspecting the `docstring.py` file to locate the `_parse_other_parameters_section` and `_parse_parameters_section` methods if they exist. It's possible that the issue description contains outdated method names or that these methods are part of a larger method handling parameters in general.\n  \n- Investigating how the `NumpyDocstring` class handles configuration options, specifically `napoleon_use_param`, to understand how it currently affects the rendering of the \"Parameters\" and \"Other Parameters\" sections.\n\n- Considering alternative approaches to locate the relevant code, such as searching for keywords related to \"Other Parameters\" within the `NumpyDocstring` class or looking for methods that handle configuration options.\n\nWithout direct access to the methods mentioned in the issue, we need to infer the structure and behavior of the `NumpyDocstring` class based on the available information and the typical responsibilities of such a class within the Sphinx `napoleon` extension."
