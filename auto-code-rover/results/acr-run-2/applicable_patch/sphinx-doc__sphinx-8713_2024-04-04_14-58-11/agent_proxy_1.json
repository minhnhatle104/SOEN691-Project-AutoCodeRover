            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: Yes, we need more context to accurately pinpoint the bug and propose a solution. Given the initial search results did not find the specific methods mentioned in the issue, we should attempt to find any methods related to parsing and formatting the \"Parameters\" and \"Other Parameters\" sections within the `NumpyDocstring` class. Additionally, understanding how configuration options like `napoleon_use_param` are applied within the class could provide crucial insights. Therefore, the following search API calls could be helpful:\n\n    1. `search_method_in_class(\"_format_fields\", \"NumpyDocstring\")`: Since the issue description mentions this method in the context of formatting fields, it might give us insight into how the \"Other Parameters\" section is formatted.\n    \n    2. `search_method_in_class(\"_format_docutils_params\", \"NumpyDocstring\")`: This method is mentioned as part of the conditional logic for formatting parameters based on the `napoleon_use_param` configuration. Understanding its implementation could reveal how the configuration affects parameter rendering.\n    \n    3. `search_code(\"napoleon_use_param\", \"sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py\")`: To understand how the `napoleon_use_param` configuration is implemented or used within the `NumpyDocstring` class.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: Without the specific methods or a clear understanding of how the `napoleon_use_param` configuration is applied in the context of the \"Other Parameters\" section, we cannot definitively identify the bug locations. However, based on the issue description and the context we have:\n\n    - **Buggy file**: `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py`\n    \n    - **Potential locations/methods to investigate**:\n        - Any method related to formatting the \"Parameters\" and \"Other Parameters\" sections, which might not have been directly identified due to naming discrepancies or search limitations.\n        - How the class handles the `napoleon_use_param` configuration, particularly in relation to formatting parameters and other parameters.\n\n    Further investigation into the mentioned file and potentially related methods is required to accurately locate and address the bug."
