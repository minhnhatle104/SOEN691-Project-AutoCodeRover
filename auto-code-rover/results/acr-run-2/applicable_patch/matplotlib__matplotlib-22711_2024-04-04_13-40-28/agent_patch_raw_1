This patch corrects the issue by ensuring that the last point of the polygon (`xy[4]`) is set to be the same as the first point (`xy[0]`), effectively closing the polygon. This approach maintains the integrity of the polygon shape used in the `RangeSlider` widget and avoids the `IndexError` by not assuming an incorrect structure for the `xy` array.
