**Explanation**: The patch addresses the issue where the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class does not correctly handle the case when the exponent in a `Pow` expression is dimensionless. The original code attempts to set `exp_dim` to 1 if it is dimensionless, which does not affect the calculation of the dimension of the result in a meaningful way. The patched version directly returns the calculated factor and dimension for the base, raised to the power of the exponent's factor, only if the exponent's dimension is dimensionless. This approach ensures that the dimensionality of the exponent is correctly accounted for when evaluating `Pow` expressions. If the dimension of the exponent is not dimensionless, a `ValueError` is raised, providing clearer feedback that could help identify incorrect usage or assumptions about the dimensionality of expressions.
