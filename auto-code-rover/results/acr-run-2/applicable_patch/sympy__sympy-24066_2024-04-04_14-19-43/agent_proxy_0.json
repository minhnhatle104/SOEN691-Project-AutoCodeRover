            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method works within the `SI` class, and how it interacts with expressions, especially those involving the exponential function (`exp`). Given the nature of the issue, it's also important to understand how dimensionality is checked and handled in expressions. Here are the API calls I would make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SI\")`: To get an overview of the `SI` class, including its methods and how it might be handling dimensions and factors.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_collect_factor_and_dimension\", \"SI\")`: To understand the implementation details of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, which seems to be at the core of the issue.\n3. `search_method(\"get_dimension_system\")`: Since the `get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)` check is failing, understanding how dimensions are retrieved and checked for being dimensionless is crucial.\n4. `search_code(\"exp(expr)\")`: To see how the exponential function is handled across the codebase, especially in relation to unit and dimension processing.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of how dimensions are managed, how the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method works, and any special handling (or lack thereof) for exponential expressions involving units."
