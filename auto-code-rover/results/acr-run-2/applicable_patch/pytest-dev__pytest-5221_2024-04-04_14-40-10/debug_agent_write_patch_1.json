Given the nature of the issue, it's likely related to the implementation of the command-line interface (CLI) for pytest and the fixture management system. Here are the API calls that would be useful to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for the method or function that handles the `--fixtures` option in pytest. This could be part of a CLI parsing module or a specific pytest plugin.\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"parse_options\")`\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"--fixtures\")`\n\n2. Since fixture scopes are an integral part of fixture definitions, we should look for where fixtures are defined or registered in pytest. This might give us insight into how scopes are currently handled and where we could integrate scope display functionality.\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"fixture\")`\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"def fixture\")`\n\n3. It would also be helpful to understand how pytest prints or displays fixture information when the `--fixtures` option is used. This could lead us to the right place to add scope information.\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"show_fixtures\")`\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"print\")` and `search_code(code_str=\"fixtures\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the current implementation and where modifications can be made to include fixture scope information in the output of `pytest --fixtures`."

These files are likely central to handling fixtures and the `--fixtures` command-line option.\n   - The `fixture` function in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` is crucial for defining fixtures. It includes a parameter for `scope`, which is directly related to the issue at hand. This function's documentation and implementation provide insights into how fixtures are defined, including their scope.\n\n2. **Fixture Scope Handling**:\n   - The `fixture` function allows defining the scope of a fixture at the time of its creation. This is done through the `scope` argument. The scope can be one of `\"function\"`, `\"class\"`, `\"module\"`, `\"package\"`, or `\"session\"`.\n   - Since the scope is an integral part of a fixture's definition, any solution to display fixture scopes with `--fixtures` will likely need to extract this information from the fixture definitions or the internal representations of fixtures within pytest.\n\n3. **Displaying Fixture Information**:\n   - Although a specific method named `show_fixtures` was not found, the presence of multiple matches for `--fixtures` in files related to fixtures and help/config suggests that the logic for handling the `--fixtures` option and displaying fixture information is spread across these files.\n   - The absence of a direct method for showing fixtures implies that the functionality to display fixture information (including scopes) might need to be integrated into the existing logic that handles the `--fixtures` option.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - To implement the feature of displaying fixture scopes, one would need to modify the logic that processes the `--fixtures` option to include scope information. This might involve changes in how fixture information is collected, formatted, and displayed to the user.\n   - A good starting point would be to further investigate `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`, `src/_pytest/python.py`, and `src/_pytest/helpconfig.py` to understand how they contribute to processing and displaying fixtures. Specifically, looking into how the `--fixtures` option is parsed and how fixture information is currently displayed could reveal where to integrate the display of scope information.\n\nIn summary, the solution to the issue will likely involve enhancing the existing functionality related to the `--fixtures` option to include fixture scope information.

        "content": "Based on the newly collected context, we can refine our understanding of where and how the feature to display fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures` could be implemented.\n\n1. **Handling of `--fixtures` Option**:\n   - The mention of the `--fixtures` option in `src/_pytest/helpconfig.py` within the `showhelp` function provides a clue that this file is involved in handling the help options, including listing available fixtures. However, this snippet mainly deals with displaying help text and does not directly implement the functionality of listing fixtures.\n\n2. **Fixture Definition and Properties**:\n   - The `fixture` function in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` is confirmed to be the decorator for marking fixture factory functions. This function takes a `scope` argument, among others, which is crucial for our feature. The presence of the `scope` parameter here confirms that any fixture defined with this decorator has its scope explicitly specified, which is the information we want to display.\n   - The `FixtureRequest` class's `fixturenames` property lists all active fixtures in a request but does not directly provide scope information. This indicates that while `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` is central to fixture management, the scope information's display might require combining data from multiple parts of the fixture management system.\n\n3. **Lack of Direct `parse` Method in `src/_pytest/python.py`**:\n   - The absence of a `parse` method in `src/_pytest/python.py` suggests that the parsing of command-line options related to fixtures might not be localized to a single, easily identifiable method within this file. This could mean that the handling of command-line arguments is more distributed or abstracted across several components.\n\n4. **Terminal Output Handling**:\n   - The findings in `src/_pytest/terminal.py` indicate various points where pytest outputs information to the terminal. Although none of the identified methods directly relate to displaying fixture information, this file is clearly involved in generating terminal output. It's possible that modifications or extensions to methods in this file could be part of how we ultimately display fixture scope information.\n\n**Summary of Analysis**:\n- The feature enhancement does not correspond to a single \"buggy\" location but rather requires integrating new functionality into the existing framework for handling fixtures and command-line options.\n- **Key Locations for Implementation**:\n  - **`src/_pytest/helpconfig.py`**: Involved in handling the `--fixtures` help text. Modifications here could include extending the help text to mention that fixture scopes will be displayed.\n  - **`src/_pytest/fixtures.py`**: Central to fixture definition and management. Enhancements here could involve ensuring that scope information is readily accessible for fixtures when preparing to list them in response to the `--fixtures` option.\n  - **`src/_pytest/terminal.py`**: Since this file is involved in terminal output, it might be a candidate for implementing the logic that formats and displays fixture information, including scopes, to the user.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- To implement the feature, one would likely need to trace how the `--fixtures` option is currently processed to list fixtures and then extend this process to include and display scope information. This might involve modifications in `src/_pytest/helpconfig.py` to initiate the feature, enhancements in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` to access scope information, and adjustments in `src/_pytest/terminal.py` to format and output this information."
