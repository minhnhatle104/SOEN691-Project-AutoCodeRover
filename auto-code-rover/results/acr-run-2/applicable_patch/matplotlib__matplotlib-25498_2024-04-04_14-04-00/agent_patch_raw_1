Based on the issue description and the context provided, the problem seems to stem from the inability of the `update_normal` method in the `Colorbar` class to effectively update the colorbar when the norm of the associated mappable changes to `LogNorm`. The method does not account for the specific requirements of updating a colorbar when its norm has been changed after its creation, especially for norms that require special handling like `LogNorm`.

Given that the `update_bruteforce` method mentioned in the issue does not exist in the provided context, and considering the error encountered (`ZeroDivisionError`) when attempting to use it, the patch will focus on improving the `update_normal` method to ensure it properly handles updates when the norm changes to `LogNorm` or any other norm that might require special handling.

This patch introduces a check within the `update_normal` method to specifically handle cases where the norm is changed to `LogNorm`. It ensures that `vmin` and `vmax` are positive, as required by `LogNorm`, by introducing a helper method `_positive_vmin_vmax` that computes positive minimum and maximum values from the data associated with the mappable. This approach aims to prevent the `ZeroDivisionError` encountered when `vmin` or `vmax` are non-positive values, which is a requirement for logarithmic scaling.
