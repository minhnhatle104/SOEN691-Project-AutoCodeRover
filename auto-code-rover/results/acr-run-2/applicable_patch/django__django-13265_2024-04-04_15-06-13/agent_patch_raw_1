Given the issue described and the code for `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations, the core of the problem seems to be the sequencing of operations where an index involving the `_order` field is attempted to be added before the `_order` field is properly established. A direct patch to the Django framework's code might not be the most appropriate solution, as this could involve altering the fundamental behavior of Django's migration system, which could have wide-ranging effects.

However, a conceptual patch could involve ensuring that the migration system checks for the existence of the `_order` field before attempting to add an index that includes it. This would likely involve modifying the `AddIndex` operation to perform this check. Note that this is a conceptual solution and might require further refinement to integrate seamlessly with Django's existing migration framework.

```python
<file>django/db/migrations/operations/models.py</file>
<original>def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):
    model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)
    if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):
        schema_editor.add_index(model, self.index)</original>
<patched>def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):
    model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)
    # Check if the index involves the '_order' field and if '_order' exists
    if '_order' in self.index.fields and not hasattr(model._meta, '_order'):
        raise ValueError("Attempting to add an index on '_order' field before it is created.")
    if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):
        schema_editor.add_index(model, self.index)</patched>
```

This modification introduces a check within the `database_forwards` method of the `AddIndex` operation. Before proceeding with adding the index, it verifies if the `_order` field is involved in the index and whether this field exists on the model. If the `_order` field is referenced but not present, it raises a `ValueError`, preventing the operation from proceeding. This is a basic safeguard and would need to be accompanied by more nuanced handling in a real-world patch, including possibly reordering operations or ensuring that the `_order` field creation is prioritized when necessary.

Keep in mind, altering Django's core migration system can have significant implications and should be approached with caution. Any changes should be thoroughly tested across various scenarios to ensure compatibility and stability. Additionally, contributing such changes back to Django would involve discussions with the Django community and adherence to the project's contribution guidelines.
