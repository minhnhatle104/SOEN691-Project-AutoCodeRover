To achieve this, we should look more closely at the regular expression used for validation (`option_desc_re`) and any related logic that might influence how option descriptions are parsed and validated.\n\nLet's perform additional searches focusing on the regular expression and the broader context of its application:\n\n1. Search for the regular expression definition (`option_desc_re`) to understand its constraints and how it might be modified to accommodate more option syntaxes.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"option_desc_re\")\n```\n\n2. Since the `handle_signature` method is identified as the location where the issue occurs, getting more context about this method could be beneficial. This includes how it's called and any related validation logic that might not be immediately visible within the method itself.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"handle_signature\", \"Cmdoption\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a more detailed understanding of the validation process and any potential areas for adjustment to resolve the issue."
