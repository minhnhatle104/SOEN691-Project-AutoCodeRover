Based on the provided context and the issue described, it seems the error occurs because the `list_display` attribute in `QuestionAdmin` is misconfigured or missing, specifically referencing a field `"choice"` that does not exist in the `Question` model. Since the `Question` model does not have a `choice` field as shown in the provided class definition, we need to either add this field to the model (if it's supposed to exist) or correct the `list_display` attribute in `QuestionAdmin` to reference existing fields. Given the context, the most straightforward and likely correction is to adjust the `QuestionAdmin` class to correctly use `list_display` with existing fields from the `Question` model.

Since the original issue mentions an error when `list_display = ["choice"]` is used, and this configuration is not directly shown in the provided `QuestionAdmin` class code snippet, I'll assume the task is to introduce a correct `list_display` attribute to the `QuestionAdmin` class.

```python
<file>tests/admin_views/admin.py</file>
<original>class QuestionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ordering = ["-posted"]
    search_fields = ["question"]
    autocomplete_fields = ["related_questions"]
</original>
<patched>class QuestionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ordering = ["-posted"]
    search_fields = ["question"]
    autocomplete_fields = ["related_questions"]
    list_display = ["question", "posted", "expires"]  # Assuming these are the fields we want to display
</patched>
```

This patch assumes that the intention is to display the `question`, `posted`, and `expires` fields in the Django admin list view for the `Question` model. Adjustments can be made based on the actual requirements or fields that are intended to be displayed. The key here is to ensure that all fields referenced in `list_display` exist on the `Question` model, as confirmed by the model's definition provided.
