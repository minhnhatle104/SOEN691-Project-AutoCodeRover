Given the context and the issue described, it seems the warning "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" might be related to how Sphinx handles images and potentially other document elements like tables when determining if they have suitable candidates for the build output. Since the specific code related to table numbering or the exact cause of the warning was not identified, I'll propose a hypothetical patch based on the information available. This patch will focus on enhancing the logging in the `post_process_images` method within the `Builder` class to provide more context, which could help in diagnosing the issue further or might indirectly address similar warnings by ensuring more informative logging is in place.

Please note, without a direct indication of the bug's location or a clear understanding of how tables are specifically handled, this patch is speculative and aims to improve diagnostics rather than directly resolve the reported warning.

```python
<file>sphinx/builders/__init__.py</file>
<original>logger.warning(__('a suitable image for %s builder not found: '
                          '%s (%s)'),
                          self.name, mimetypes, image_uri, location=node)
</original>
<patched>logger.warning(__('a suitable image or table for %s builder not found: '
                          '%s (%s). Please check if the table has an assigned number or if the image is included correctly.'),
                          self.name, mimetypes, image_uri, location=node)
</patched>

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/builders/__init__.py</file>
<original>logger.warning(__('a suitable image for %s builder not found: %s'),
                          self.name, image_uri, location=node)
</original>
<patched>logger.warning(__('a suitable image or table for %s builder not found: %s. '
                          'This might be due to missing numbering for tables or issues including the image.'),
                          self.name, image_uri, location=node)
</patched>
```

This patch modifies the warning messages to suggest checking for both image inclusion issues and table numbering, which could help users diagnose similar problems. It's a stopgap measure until a more precise cause of the "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" can be identified and directly addressed.
