However, without a clear direction from the initial searches, it's challenging to construct specific API calls without more granular insights into how Sphinx's version 3.3 might have changed relevant behaviors. A manual review of the changelog for Sphinx 3.3, discussions in the Sphinx community, or issues reported around the time of the 3.3 release might provide the necessary context to formulate more targeted search API calls.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\nAt this stage, we do not have enough information to specify buggy files and methods. The issue likely involves complex interactions within Sphinx's document processing system, particularly how tables are handled and numbered during the build process. The `Builder` class in `sphinx/builders/__init__.py` and the various `warn` methods across the codebase are potential areas of interest, but without more specific information, pinpointing the exact location of the bug is not feasible."
