# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/svm/base.py</file>
<original>self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
            (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
            (n_class, n_SV))</original>
<patched># Handle the case when n_class is 0, creating an empty csr_matrix for dual_coef_
if n_class > 0:
    self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
        (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
        (n_class, n_SV))
else:
    self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix((0, 0))</patched>
```

These modifications address the `ZeroDivisionError` by ensuring that division by zero is avoided and handling the case when `n_class` is 0 by creating an empty `csr_matrix` for `dual_coef_`. This should resolve the issue without affecting the functionality of the SVM for cases where `support_vectors_` is not empty.
