Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"QuerySet.Delete\")`: This will help us understand where the `Delete` method is defined within the `QuerySet` class or if it's inherited from a parent class. It will give us an overview of how deletion is handled and where the inconsistency might be introduced.\n\n2. `search_class(\"FileAccess\")`: Since the issue mentions a specific model `my_app.FileAccess` which seems to have a foreign key, this will help us understand the structure of this model and its relationship with other models.\n\n3. `search_class(\"BlockLibrary\")`: This is to understand the structure of the \"simple\" model without foreign keys, as mentioned in the issue. It will help us compare how deletion is handled differently for models with and without foreign keys.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to understand the problem and begin formulating a solution."
