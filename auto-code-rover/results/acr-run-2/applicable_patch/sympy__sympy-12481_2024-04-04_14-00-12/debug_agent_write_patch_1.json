This class contains a variety of methods related to permutations, including constructors, properties, and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion. The issue at hand concerns the constructor of the `Permutation` class, which fails when non-disjoint cycles are provided as input.\n\nThe issue description suggests that the constructor should be able to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order to construct the resulting permutation. However, the current implementation raises a `ValueError` in such cases. This indicates that the constructor (likely implemented in the `__new__` method or a method closely related to object instantiation) does not currently support the desired behavior for non-disjoint cycles.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to understand how the `Permutation` class processes its input arguments during instantiation and identify where the check for disjoint cycles occurs, as well as where the `ValueError` is raised. Given this context, the next step would be to examine the `__new__` method and any other methods that are directly involved in the instantiation process, such as `_af_new`, which might be responsible for creating a new permutation from the provided cycles.\n\nThe goal will be to modify the instantiation logic to allow for non-disjoint cycles, applying them in the specified order to produce the correct permutation. This will likely involve adjusting the logic that currently checks for disjoint cycles and raises the `ValueError`, as well as implementing the mechanism for correctly applying non-disjoint cycles to construct the permutation."

        "content": "The collected context from the `Permutation` class, specifically from the `__new__` and `_af_new` methods, provides valuable insights into how permutations are constructed and the current limitations that lead to the issue described.\n\n### Analysis of `__new__` Method\nThe `__new__` method in the `Permutation` class is responsible for constructing a new permutation object. It supports various forms of input, including array form, cyclic form, and even single integers. The method has several checks to ensure the validity of the input:\n- It checks for the presence of all integers from 0 up to the maximum specified or implied by the input unless the input is in cyclic form.\n- It raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the input, which is the crux of the reported issue. This check is performed both for array form and cyclic form inputs.\n- For cyclic form inputs, it attempts to resolve the cycles using the `Cycle` class before converting them to array form. However, it explicitly checks for repeated elements and raises a `ValueError` if any are found, without attempting to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order as the issue suggests should be the case.\n\n### Analysis of `_af_new` Method\nThe `_af_new` method is a utility method meant for internal use to quickly create a new `Permutation` object from a list representing the permutation in array form. It does not perform any checks on the input list; it directly assigns the list to the `_array_form` attribute of a new `Permutation` object.\n\n### Conclusion and Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class within the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file. The issue arises because the method does not support constructing a permutation from non-disjoint cycles. Instead of applying non-disjoint cycles in the specified left-to-right order, it prematurely raises a `ValueError` upon detecting repeated elements in the input.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the logic in the `__new__` method needs to be adjusted to allow for non-disjoint cycles. This involves removing or modifying the check that raises a `ValueError` for repeated elements when the input is in cyclic form and implementing a mechanism to correctly apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order to produce the resulting permutation."
