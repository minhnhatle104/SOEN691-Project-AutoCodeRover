Given the complexity of the issue and without a clear pinpoint of the exact cause from the provided context, a precise patch cannot be accurately determined. However, based on the nature of the problem described in the issue - that simplification leads to an inequivalent expression, particularly involving complex numbers, I can propose a hypothetical patch that might address potential issues in handling complex expressions during simplification. This patch aims to add a check to ensure the simplification process does not inadvertently change the nature of the expression from real to complex or vice versa.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might not directly solve the issue without further testing and refinement.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):
        expr = original_expr</original>
<patched># Added check to ensure the simplified expression does not change in nature (real to complex or vice versa)
if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr) or not expr.is_real == original_expr.is_real:
        expr = original_expr</patched>
```

This patch adds an additional condition to revert the expression to its original form if the simplification process changes its nature regarding being real or complex. This is a simplistic approach and assumes that the `is_real` property is accurately set for both the original and simplified expressions. Further testing and refinement would be necessary to ensure this patch does not introduce new issues or overlook edge cases.

It's important to note that the actual bug might be deeply rooted in the specific simplification strategies applied to the expression. Therefore, a thorough review and potentially more targeted fixes within those strategies might be required to fully resolve the issue.
