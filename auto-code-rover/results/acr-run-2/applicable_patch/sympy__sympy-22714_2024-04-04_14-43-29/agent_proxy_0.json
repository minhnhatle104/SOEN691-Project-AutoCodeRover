            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `Point2D` class and the `evaluate` context manager are implemented and interact with each other. Specifically, we need to investigate the implementation of the `Point2D` constructor to understand why it raises a `ValueError` when used with `evaluate(False)`. Additionally, understanding how the `evaluate` context manager affects the evaluation of expressions could provide insights into the cause of the issue.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Point2D\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of the `Point2D` class, especially how it handles the instantiation with given coordinates.\n\n2. `search_method(\"evaluate\")`: Since `evaluate` is likely a method or a function that affects the global evaluation state, this search will help us understand how it is implemented and how it might interact with the instantiation of `Point2D`.\n\nThese searches should provide sufficient information to start diagnosing the issue described."
