Therefore, no further search API calls are necessary at this point. The precise location of the bug has been identified based on the provided context and analysis:\n\n- **Buggy File**: `seaborn/_stats/regression.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `PolyFit._fit_predict`\n\nThis method is where the error occurs due to the handling of missing data (None values) when calling `np.polyfit`. The solution involves implementing a mechanism within this method to filter out or otherwise handle missing data before proceeding with the polynomial fitting process."
