Based on the information provided and the constraints of our interaction, the identified buggy location within the `seaborn` project is as follows:\n\n- **Buggy File**: `seaborn/_stats/regression.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `PolyFit._fit_predict`\n\nThis method is where the error occurs due to the handling of missing data (None values) when calling `np.polyfit`. The solution involves implementing a mechanism within this method to filter out or otherwise handle missing data before proceeding with the polynomial fitting process.\n\nGiven the limitations of our current interaction, I cannot perform further searches or provide more precise locations without additional specific search capabilities or more detailed insights into the project's source code beyond what has been provided. The analysis and identification of the bug are based on the traceback information, the structure of the `PolyFit` class, and the usage of `np.polyfit` within the `_fit_predict` method as revealed by the search results."
