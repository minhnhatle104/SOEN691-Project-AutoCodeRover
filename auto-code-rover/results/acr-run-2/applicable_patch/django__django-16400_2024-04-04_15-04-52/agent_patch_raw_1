Given the issue description and the context retrieved, the core of the problem seems to be that the `migrate` command does not respect the database parameter for all operations, particularly in the context of a custom database router setup for a multi-tenant service. The detailed implementation of the custom middleware and router was not available, but the issue likely lies in how the database parameter is passed and used within Django's migration system, specifically within the `MigrationExecutor` class.

Since the exact cause within the custom components cannot be pinpointed without their implementations, a general approach to ensure the database parameter is respected throughout the migration process, including any post-migration database read operations, would involve ensuring that the database parameter is explicitly considered when determining the database for read and write operations within migrations.

However, without specific details on the custom components or the exact points of failure, providing a precise patch is challenging. A hypothetical patch could involve modifying the `MigrationExecutor` to ensure it respects a database parameter when setting up the database connection for migrations. This would be speculative and might not directly address the issue if the problem lies within the custom middleware or router's handling of database connections.

Since we cannot provide a direct patch without more context, especially regarding the custom middleware and router, a recommended approach would be to:

1. Review the custom `TenantDatabaseRouter` implementation to ensure it correctly handles the database parameter for all operations, including reads that occur after migrations.
2. Ensure that any database operations triggered by migrations explicitly pass the database parameter to the router, possibly by modifying the migration executor or the way migrations are called to include this parameter.

For educational purposes, here's a hypothetical modification that ensures the `MigrationExecutor` considers a `database` parameter (assuming such a parameter could be passed and utilized within the migration process):

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/executor.py</file>
<original>def migrate(self, targets, plan=None, state=None, fake=False, fake_initial=False):</original>
<patched>def migrate(self, targets, plan=None, state=None, fake=False, fake_initial=False, database=None):</patched>
```

This modification introduces a `database` parameter to the `migrate` method, which would then need to be utilized within the method to ensure that all database operations respect this parameter. This is a starting point and would require additional modifications throughout the method and potentially other parts of the migration system to fully respect the `database` parameter.

Please note, this is a speculative and simplified example. Implementing this change would require a comprehensive understanding of Django's migration system and careful testing to ensure compatibility and correctness.
