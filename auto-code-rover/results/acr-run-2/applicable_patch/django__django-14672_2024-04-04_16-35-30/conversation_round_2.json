        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered the following context relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **ManyToManyRel Class**:\n   - Located in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`.\n   - Inherits from `ForeignObjectRel`.\n   - Contains an `__init__` method where `through_fields` is one of the parameters, but there's no direct manipulation of `through_fields` to ensure it's hashable within this class.\n   - Has a property `identity`, which could be relevant to how instances of this class are compared or hashed, but the implementation details of `identity` are not provided in the search result.\n\n2. **make_hashable Function**:\n   - Located in `django/utils/hashable.py`.\n   - Designed to attempt making a value hashable by converting it to a tuple if it's a dictionary or an iterable that isn't inherently hashable. If the value is already hashable, it returns the value as is.\n   - This function is crucial for ensuring that elements like `through_fields`, if they are lists (which are not inherently hashable), can be made hashable.\n\n3. **Absence of make_hashable in ForeignObjectRel**:\n   - The search did not find a `make_hashable` method within the `ForeignObjectRel` class, indicating that `make_hashable` is not directly used within the class or its methods. This suggests that the usage of `make_hashable` to ensure hashability of elements like `limit_choices_to` or `through_fields` needs to be explicitly implemented where necessary.\n\nGiven this context, the issue at hand is that `through_fields`, when it is a list, is not being made hashable in the `ManyToManyRel` class. This leads to a `TypeError` when Django attempts to hash `ManyToManyRel` instances, particularly during model checks, and this problem seems to manifest more prominently with proxy models.\n\nTo solve this issue, we need to ensure that `through_fields` is made hashable within the `ManyToManyRel` class, likely within its `identity` property or during its initialization. This would involve using the `make_hashable` function on `through_fields` when it's being set or when `identity` is being computed.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the `ManyToManyRel` class to incorporate this change."
