            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the `ManyToManyRel` class and the `make_hashable` method or function. Specifically, we want to understand where `ManyToManyRel` is defined and how `make_hashable` is implemented or used in relation to `ForeignObjectRel` or similar classes. This will help us understand where and how to apply the fix for making `through_fields` hashable.\n\nGiven the information in the issue, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Search for the `ManyToManyRel` class to understand its structure and current implementation, especially how it handles `through_fields`.\n   \n   `search_class(\"ManyToManyRel\")`\n\n2. Search for the `make_hashable` method or function to understand its implementation and how it's used to make elements hashable. This is crucial for understanding how to apply it to `through_fields`.\n\n   `search_method(\"make_hashable\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions that the identity property has been added to all `ForeignObjectRel` to make it possible to compare them, it would be useful to see how `make_hashable` is called in relation to `ForeignObjectRel` or its subclasses.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"make_hashable\", \"ForeignObjectRel\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive understanding of the components involved in the issue and guide the development of a patch."
