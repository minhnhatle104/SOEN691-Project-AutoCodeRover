A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 40.6.3\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.15.4\nscipy: 1.2.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the `AffinityPropagation` class and its methods, we can analyze the behavior and structure related to the issue reported. The key points from the analysis are as follows:\n\n1. **Initialization and Parameters**:\n   - The `AffinityPropagation` class is initialized with several parameters, including `damping`, `max_iter`, `convergence_iter`, `copy`, `preference`, `affinity`, and `verbose`. None of these parameters directly indicate whether the algorithm has converged, but `max_iter` and `convergence_iter` are critical for understanding the convergence process.\n\n2. **The `fit` Method**:\n   - The `fit` method is responsible for fitting the clustering model to the data. It checks the type of affinity (precomputed or euclidean) and calculates the affinity matrix accordingly.\n   - The actual clustering process is handled by the `affinity_propagation` function, which returns `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. The `n_iter_` could potentially be used to infer convergence by comparing it to `max_iter`, but this is not explicitly done within the `fit` method.\n   - There is no explicit check or property within the `fit` method that sets or checks a convergence flag.\n\n3. **The `predict` Method**:\n   - The `predict` method is designed to predict the closest cluster each sample in X belongs to. It checks if the model has been fitted and if `cluster_centers_` exist.\n   - Importantly, if there are no cluster centers because the algorithm did not converge, it issues a warning and labels every sample as '-1'. This behavior is somewhat aligned with the expected behavior described in the issue but is only applicable to the `predict` method, not the initial clustering (`fit` method).\n\n4. **Convergence Indication**:\n   - The search for a `converged_` method or property in the `AffinityPropagation` class yielded no results, indicating that there is no explicit attribute or method designed to directly indicate whether the algorithm has converged.\n\nGiven this analysis, the discrepancy noted in the issue seems to stem from the lack of explicit handling or reporting of non-convergence within the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class. While the `predict` method does handle non-convergence by warning and assigning a label of '-1' to all samples, the `fit` method does not seem to set `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` in a way that reflects non-convergence directly, contrary to what the documentation suggests.\n\nTo address the issue, a patch could involve:\n- Implementing a check after the `affinity_propagation` call within the `fit` method to see if `n_iter_` reached `max_iter` without proper convergence and adjusting `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` accordingly.\n- Alternatively, introducing a `converged_` attribute that gets set based on the outcome of the clustering process and can be checked by users to verify convergence.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting these changes in code to resolve the issue."
