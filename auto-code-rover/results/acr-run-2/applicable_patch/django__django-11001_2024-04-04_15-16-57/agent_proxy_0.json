Additionally, understanding how `ordering_parts` is used within `get_order_by` is crucial. Here are the API calls that would help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SQLCompiler\")`: This will help us find the file or files where the `SQLCompiler` class is defined, which is essential for understanding the broader context of where the `get_order_by` method is implemented.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get_order_by\", \"SQLCompiler\")`: With this, we can find the implementation details of the `get_order_by` method within the `SQLCompiler` class, which is directly related to the issue.\n\n3. `search_code(\"ordering_parts.search\"): This will help us understand how `ordering_parts` is being used across the codebase, especially in relation to searching within SQL queries, which seems to be at the heart of the issue described."
