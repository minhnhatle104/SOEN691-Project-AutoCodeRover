<original>without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)</original>

without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)</patched>
```

This modification addresses the issue by transforming the SQL query into a single line before performing the regular expression search for ordering parts. This approach ensures that multi-line `RawSQL` expressions are treated as a single entity, preventing the incorrect identification of duplicates based on their last lines. The use of `splitlines()` instead of splitting on `\n` directly is a more robust solution as it handles different newline characters (`\n`, `\r\n`, etc.) appropriately, which aligns with the issue submitter's caution regarding end-of-line (EOL) characters.
