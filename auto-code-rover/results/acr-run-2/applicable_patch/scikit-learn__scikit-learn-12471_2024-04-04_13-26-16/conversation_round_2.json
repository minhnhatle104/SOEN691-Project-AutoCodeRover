The memory of the arrays is not handled safely and it can lead to a ValueError\nBasically, when you call the transform method it will sets all the unknown strings on your array to OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] which is the first category alphabetically sorted given for fit\nIf this OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] is a long string, and the array that you want to transform has small strings, then it is impossible to fit the whole  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] into the entries of the array we want to transform. So  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0]  is truncated and this raise the ValueError.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n# It needs to be numpy arrays, the error does not appear\n# is you have lists of lists because it gets treated like an array of objects.\ntrain  = np.array([ '22','333','4444','11111111' ]).reshape((-1,1))\ntest   = np.array([ '55555',  '22' ]).reshape((-1,1))\nohe = OneHotEncoder(dtype=bool,handle_unknown='ignore')\nohe.fit( train )\nenc_test = ohe.transform( test )\n```\n#### Expected Results\nHere we should get an sparse matrix 2x4 false everywhere except at (1,1) the '22' that is known\n#### Actual Results\n> ValueError: y contains previously unseen labels: ['111111']\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18)  [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]\nmachine: Linux-4.4.0-138-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python\nBLAS:\nmacros: HAVE_CBLAS=None\ncblas_libs: openblas, openblas\nlib_dirs: /usr/lib\nPython deps:\nCython: 0.25.2\nscipy: 0.18.1\nsetuptools: 36.7.0\npip: 9.0.1\nnumpy: 1.15.2\npandas: 0.19.1\nsklearn: 0.21.dev0\n#### Comments\nI already implemented a fix for this issue, where I check the size of the elements in the array before, and I cast them into objects if necessary.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information collected from the `OneHotEncoder` class and its `transform` method, we can start to analyze the context and structure relevant to the issue reported.\n\n### Analysis of `OneHotEncoder` Class\nThe `OneHotEncoder` class is defined in `sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py`. It inherits from `_BaseEncoder` and is designed to encode categorical features as a one-hot numeric array. The constructor of `OneHotEncoder` accepts several parameters, including `handle_unknown`, which determines the behavior when unknown categories are encountered during transformation. The default behavior is to raise an error, but it can be set to 'ignore' to bypass unknown categories.\n\n### Analysis of `transform` Method\nThe `transform` method is responsible for transforming the input data (`X`) using one-hot encoding. The method checks if the encoder is fitted (`check_is_fitted(self, 'categories_')`) and then proceeds with the transformation. There's a distinction between legacy mode (`self._legacy_mode`) and the new transformation process, where the latter is executed through `self._transform_new(X)`.\n\n### Issue Context\nThe issue arises when `handle_unknown='ignore'` is set, and the input data contains unknown string categories. The bug description indicates a problem with memory handling and a `ValueError` being raised when the first category (alphabetically sorted) is longer than the strings in the array to be transformed. This suggests that the error might be occurring in the process of handling unknown categories during the transformation, possibly in the `self._transform_new(X)` method or related utility functions that handle the 'ignore' behavior for unknown categories.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo further investigate and address this issue, we should look into the implementation details of `self._transform_new(X)` and any related utility functions that deal with unknown categories when `handle_unknown='ignore'`. Specifically, we need to understand how categories are handled, how memory is managed for the transformed array, and how the transformation process deals with string lengths and unknown categories.\n\nGiven the information we have, the next logical steps would be to:\n1. Examine the implementation of `self._transform_new(X)` in the `OneHotEncoder` class.\n2. Investigate any utility functions or parts of the code that specifically handle unknown categories when `handle_unknown='ignore'`.\n\nThis approach will help us identify the root cause of the issue and develop a patch to fix the bug."

        "content": "With the detailed context provided by the `_transform_new` method within the `OneHotEncoder` class, we can analyze how the transformation process is handled, especially in the context of unknown categories and string data types. This method is crucial for understanding the root cause of the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis of `_transform_new` Method\n\nThe `_transform_new` method is responsible for the new implementation of the transformation process, assuming categorical input. Here are the key steps in the method that are relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **Input Checking and Conversion**: The method starts by checking the input array `X` and determining its data type. If `X` does not have a `dtype` and its temporary dtype is a subtype of `np.str_`, it is converted to an object dtype (`np.object`). This step ensures that string data is handled correctly, but it does not directly address the issue of handling unknown categories.\n\n2. **Transformation and Masking**: The method transforms `X` into integer indices (`X_int`) and a mask (`X_mask`) indicating valid (known) categories. This is done by calling `self._transform(X, handle_unknown=self.handle_unknown)`, which should handle the 'ignore' behavior for unknown categories.\n\n3. **Sparse Matrix Construction**: The method constructs a sparse matrix (`out`) based on the transformed data, using the indices and mask to place ones in the correct positions of the matrix. This matrix represents the one-hot encoded output.\n\n### Identifying the Bug Location\n\nThe issue described in the bug report involves handling unknown string categories when `handle_unknown='ignore'`. Specifically, the problem arises when the first category (alphabetically sorted) is longer than the strings in the array to be transformed, leading to a `ValueError`.\n\nGiven the steps outlined in the `_transform_new` method, the bug is likely related to how unknown categories are handled during the transformation process (`X_int, X_mask = self._transform(X, handle_unknown=self.handle_unknown)`). However, the detailed implementation of handling unknown categories ('ignore' option) and the subsequent memory management issues described are not fully visible in the provided method code. The actual truncation and insertion of the first category's value into the transformed array, leading to the `ValueError`, are not explicitly covered in the `_transform_new` method's code snippet.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe bug is likely located in the mechanisms that:\n- Determine how unknown categories are handled and represented in `X_int` and `X_mask`.\n- Manage memory and data types during the transformation, especially when dealing with string data and the 'ignore' option for unknown categories.\n\nTo fully address the issue, we would need to inspect:\n- The implementation of `self._transform(X, handle_unknown=self.handle_unknown)` called within `_transform_new`.\n- How the method deals with string lengths and memory allocation for unknown categories that are ignored.\n\nThis analysis points us towards the need to understand the internal workings of `self._transform` and possibly other utility functions involved in handling unknown categories and memory management for string data types."
