            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more information about the `check_array` method and how it interacts with pandas `DataFrame` objects, especially in relation to the `warn_on_dtype` parameter. The issue indicates that the expected warning is not being thrown when a DataFrame with `dtype=object` is passed to `check_array` with `warn_on_dtype=True`.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be useful to understand the current implementation and potentially identify why the warning is not being triggered as expected:\n\n1. `search_method(\"check_array\")`: This will help us find where the `check_array` method is defined in the codebase.\n2. `search_code(\"warn_on_dtype\")`: Since the issue is specifically related to the `warn_on_dtype` parameter, searching for this keyword in the codebase might reveal how it's used within the `check_array` method or elsewhere, providing clues on why it's not functioning as expected with DataFrames."
