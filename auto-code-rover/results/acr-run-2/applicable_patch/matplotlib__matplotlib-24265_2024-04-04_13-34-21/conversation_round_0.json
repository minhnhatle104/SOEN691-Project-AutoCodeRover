I recently installed my code on a machine with matplotlib version 3.6.1 and upon importing my code, this generated a key error for line `the_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]` saying \"seaborn-colorblind\" was a bad key.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nthe_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]\n```\n### Actual outcome\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nKeyError: 'seaborn-colorblind'\n### Expected outcome\nseaborn-colorblind should be set as the matplotlib library style and I should be able to continue plotting with that style.\n### Additional information\n- Bug occurs with matplotlib version 3.6.1\n- Bug does not occur with matplotlib version 3.4.3\n- Tested on MacOSX and Ubuntu (same behavior on both)\n### Operating system\nOS/X\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.6.1\n### Matplotlib Backend\nMacOSX\n### Python version\n3.9.7\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\npip\n</issue>"
