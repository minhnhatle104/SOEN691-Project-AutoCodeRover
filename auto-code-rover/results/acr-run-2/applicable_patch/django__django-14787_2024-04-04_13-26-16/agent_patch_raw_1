```

This patch addresses the issue where `method_decorator` fails to properly handle decorators that are `functools.partial` objects, lacking attributes like `__name__`. By checking if the decorator is a partial object, we can manually set the `__name__` and `__doc__` attributes for the `_dec` function, using the underlying function (`decorator.func`) of the partial object. This ensures that even when partial objects are used as decorators, `method_decorator` can still preserve essential function attributes, preventing the `AttributeError` described in the issue.
