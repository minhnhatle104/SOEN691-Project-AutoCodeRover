2024-04-04 13:27:42 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the collected context from the search results, we have the following information:\n\n1. **`method_decorator` Implementation**: Found in `django/utils/decorators.py`, the `method_decorator` function is designed to convert a function decorator into a method decorator. The implementation checks if the object it decorates is a class or a function. If it's a class, the `name` argument is required to specify which method of the class is being decorated. The decorator then either applies itself to the method (if `name` is provided and the target is a class) or directly to the function. It uses an internal function `_multi_decorate` to apply the decorator, and it ensures that the decorated object is callable. The implementation also takes care of updating the wrapper's metadata using `update_wrapper`.\n\n2. **Usage of `@method_decorator(logger)`**: The search did not find any instances of `@method_decorator(logger)` in the codebase. This could mean that the issue description provided an example that doesn't directly correspond to the current state of the codebase, or it's a hypothetical or planned usage scenario that hasn't been implemented yet.\n\n3. **`logger` Method**: The search did not find a method named `logger` in the codebase. This suggests that the `logger` decorator described in the issue might be a custom implementation provided by the user or a third-party library not directly available in the current codebase search scope.\n\nGiven this context, the core of the issue seems to be related to how `method_decorator` interacts with partial objects, specifically when it's expected to handle objects that lack typical function attributes like `__name__` and `__module__`. The error described in the issue (`AttributeError: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'`) indicates that somewhere in the process, either `method_decorator` or the way it's intended to be used with `logger` does not account for partial objects correctly.\n\nSince the `logger` method is not found in the codebase, and there's no direct usage of `@method_decorator(logger)`, the solution might involve ensuring that `method_decorator` can gracefully handle partial objects by checking for and managing the absence of expected attributes or by providing a way to manually specify these attributes when they are not automatically available.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to `method_decorator` to ensure it can handle partial objects more gracefully, possibly by enhancing the `_multi_decorate` function or the attribute handling in `_dec`. However, without a direct example of `logger` or its intended usage, the solution would need to be general enough to handle similar cases.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

By checking if the decorator is a partial object, we can manually set the `__name__` and `__doc__` attributes for the `_dec` function, using the underlying function (`decorator.func`) of the partial object. This ensures that even when partial objects are used as decorators, `method_decorator` can still preserve essential function attributes, preventing the `AttributeError` described in the issue.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
