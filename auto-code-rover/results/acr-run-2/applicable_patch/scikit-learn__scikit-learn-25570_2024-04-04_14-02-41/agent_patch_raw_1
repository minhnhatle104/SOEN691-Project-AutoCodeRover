**Explanation**:
- **Modification 1**: Adjusts the `_iter` method to ensure that transformers with no features are still yielded when the output format is set to "pandas". This change aims to prevent the "Length mismatch" error by including these transformers in the output feature name generation process, even if they do not contribute any features. This is a speculative fix based on the understanding that the issue arises due to these transformers being skipped entirely, leading to a mismatch in the number of columns.
  
- **Modification 2**: Modifies the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` method to handle the case where the output format is "pandas" and a transformer has no features. It ensures that feature names are prefixed with the transformer's name, and in cases where a transformer contributes no features, it adds a placeholder feature name to maintain consistency in the output structure. This change aims to address the potential root cause of the issue by ensuring that the output feature names match the actual transformed output, including handling transformers with no features.

These modifications are proposed based on the analysis of the provided context and aim to address the issue described in the bug report. Further testing and validation would be required to ensure that these changes effectively resolve the issue without introducing new problems.
