It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nHere is some code to reproduce the error. If you remove .set_output(transform=\"pandas\") on the line before last, all works fine. If you remove the (\"categorical\", ...) step, it works fine too.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\nX = pd.DataFrame(data=[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], [4, 2, 2, 5]],\ncolumns=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"])\ny = np.array([0, 1])\ncategorical_features = []\nnumerical_features = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\nmodel_preprocessing = (\"preprocessing\",\nColumnTransformer([\n('categorical', 'passthrough', categorical_features),\n('numerical', Pipeline([(\"scaler\", RobustScaler()),\n(\"imputer\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\"median\"))\n]), numerical_features),\n], remainder='drop'))\npipeline = Pipeline([model_preprocessing, (\"classifier\", LGBMClassifier())]).set_output(transform=\"pandas\")\npipeline.fit(X, y)\n```\n### Expected Results\nThe step with no features should be ignored.\n### Actual Results\nHere is the error message:\n```pytb\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/home/philippe/workspace/script.py\", line 22, in <module>\npipeline.fit(X, y)\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/pipeline.py\", line 402, in fit\nXt = self._fit(X, y, **fit_params_steps)\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/pipeline.py\", line 360, in _fit\nX, fitted_transformer = fit_transform_one_cached(\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/joblib/memory.py\", line 349, in __call__\nreturn self.func(*args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/pipeline.py\", line 894, in _fit_transform_one\nres = transformer.fit_transform(X, y, **fit_params)\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_set_output.py\", line 142, in wrapped\ndata_to_wrap = f(self, X, *args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\", line 750, in fit_transform\nreturn self._hstack(list(Xs))\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\", line 862, in _hstack\noutput.columns = names_out\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py\", line 5596, in __setattr__\nreturn object.__setattr__(self, name, value)\nFile \"pandas/_libs/properties.pyx\", line 70, in pandas._libs.properties.AxisProperty.__set__\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py\", line 769, in _set_axis\nself._mgr.set_axis(axis, labels)\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/managers.py\", line 214, in set_axis\nself._validate_set_axis(axis, new_labels)\nFile \"/home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/deleteme/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/base.py\", line 69, in _validate_set_axis\nraise ValueError(\nValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 3 elements, new values have 0 elements\nProcess finished with exit code 1\n```\n### Versions\n```shell\nSystem:\npython: 3.9.15 (main, Nov 24 2022, 14:31:59)  [GCC 11.2.0]\nexecutable: /home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/strategy-training/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-5.15.0-57-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.31\nPython dependencies:\nsklearn: 1.2.0\npip: 22.2.2\nsetuptools: 62.3.2\nnumpy: 1.23.5\nscipy: 1.9.3\nCython: None\npandas: 1.4.1\nmatplotlib: 3.6.3\njoblib: 1.2.0\nthreadpoolctl: 3.1.0\nBuilt with OpenMP: True\nthreadpoolctl info:\nuser_api: openmp\ninternal_api: openmp\nprefix: libgomp\nfilepath: /home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/strategy-training/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scikit_learn.libs/libgomp-a34b3233.so.1.0.0\nversion: None\nnum_threads: 12\nuser_api: blas\ninternal_api: openblas\nprefix: libopenblas\nfilepath: /home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/strategy-training/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy.libs/libopenblas64_p-r0-742d56dc.3.20.so\nversion: 0.3.20\nthreading_layer: pthreads\narchitecture: Haswell\nnum_threads: 12\nuser_api: blas\ninternal_api: openblas\nprefix: libopenblas\nfilepath: /home/philippe/.anaconda3/envs/strategy-training/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scipy.libs/libopenblasp-r0-41284840.3.18.so\nversion: 0.3.18\nthreading_layer: pthreads\narchitecture: Haswell\nnum_threads: 12\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, let's analyze the context and identify potential causes and solutions for the issue described in the bug report.\n\n### Analysis of `ColumnTransformer` and Related Methods\n\n1. **`ColumnTransformer` Class Overview**:\n   - The `ColumnTransformer` class is designed to apply transformers to columns of an array or pandas DataFrame. It allows different columns or column subsets of the input to be transformed separately and the features generated by each transformer will be concatenated to form a single feature space.\n   - It has a parameter `remainder` which can be set to \"drop\" (default) or \"passthrough\" for columns not explicitly selected.\n\n2. **`_iter` Method**:\n   - The `_iter` method generates tuples of (name, transformer, column, weight) for each transformer.\n   - It handles both fitted and unfitted transformers differently. For fitted transformers, it can replace \"passthrough\" with the actual transformer and skip \"drop\" transformers.\n   - Importantly, it has a condition to skip transformers if `_is_empty_column_selection(columns)` returns `True`, which likely relates to the issue where transformers with no features (empty column selection) are not being handled as expected when outputting to pandas.\n\n3. **`_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` Method**:\n   - This method prefixes the output feature names with the transformer names, which is useful for ensuring the uniqueness of feature names in the output.\n   - It has a mechanism to check for unique feature names and raises a ValueError if non-unique feature names are detected, unless `verbose_feature_names_out` is set to `True`.\n\n### Potential Cause of the Issue\n\nThe issue arises when a `ColumnTransformer` is used with a transformer that applies to 0 features (an empty column selection) and the output is set to \"pandas\". The error message indicates a \"Length mismatch\" when attempting to set the columns of a pandas DataFrame, suggesting that the expected number of columns does not match the actual number of columns generated.\n\nFrom the `_iter` method's description, it seems that transformers with no features are correctly skipped during the transformation process. However, the problem may lie in how the output feature names are handled or generated, especially when the output is a pandas DataFrame. The `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` method expects a list of feature names to prefix, but if a transformer is skipped due to having no features, this might lead to a discrepancy in the expected vs. actual number of feature names.\n\n### Proposed Solution Direction\n\nA potential solution could involve ensuring that the handling of feature names in `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` and the overall feature name management logic in `ColumnTransformer` correctly accounts for transformers that are skipped due to having no features. This might include:\n\n- Verifying that the logic for generating and managing output feature names correctly handles cases where some transformers are skipped.\n- Ensuring that the final set of feature names matches the actual transformed output, especially when some transformers apply to 0 features and the output is set to \"pandas\".\n\nFurther investigation and debugging would be required to pinpoint the exact cause and to implement a precise fix. Adjustments might be needed in how feature names are collected, managed, and set for the output DataFrame to ensure consistency and to avoid the \"Length mismatch\" error."

This change aims to prevent the \"Length mismatch\" error by including these transformers in the output feature name generation process, even if they do not contribute any features. This is a speculative fix based on the understanding that the issue arises due to these transformers being skipped entirely, leading to a mismatch in the number of columns.\n  \n- **Modification 2**: Modifies the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` method to handle the case where the output format is \"pandas\" and a transformer has no features. It ensures that feature names are prefixed with the transformer's name, and in cases where a transformer contributes no features, it adds a placeholder feature name to maintain consistency in the output structure. This change aims to address the potential root cause of the issue by ensuring that the output feature names match the actual transformed output, including handling transformers with no features.\n\nThese modifications are proposed based on the analysis of the provided context and aim to address the issue described in the bug report. Further testing and validation would be required to ensure that these changes effectively resolve the issue without introducing new problems."
