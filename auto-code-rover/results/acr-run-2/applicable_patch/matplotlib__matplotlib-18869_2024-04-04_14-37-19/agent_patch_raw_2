I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's address the issue with a more structured approach. Here are the proposed modifications to enhance version information accessibility in the matplotlib project:

### Modification 1: Rename `__version_tuple__` to `version_info` in `lib/matplotlib/_version.py`
This change aims to make the version tuple more intuitive and consistent with common practices in other projects.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
__version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (3, 5, 0, 'dev1324', 'gb7d0591986')
</original>
<patched>
version_info = (3, 5, 0, 'dev1324', 'gb7d0591986')
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Update `__getattr__` in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` to expose `version_info`
This modification ensures that `version_info` is easily accessible as a top-level attribute, improving usability for version comparison.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>
def __getattr__(name):
    if name == "__version__":
        import setuptools_scm
</original>
<patched>
def __getattr__(name):
    if name == "version_info":
        from . import _version
        return _version.version_info
    elif name == "__version__":
        import setuptools_scm
</patched>
```

These modifications collectively aim to enhance the usability of version information in matplotlib, making it easier for users to perform version checks and comparisons. The first modification simplifies the naming convention by adopting `version_info`, which is more intuitive and aligns with common practices. The second modification ensures that this information is readily accessible to users by dynamically exposing `version_info` as a top-level attribute through the `__getattr__` method in `__init__.py`.
