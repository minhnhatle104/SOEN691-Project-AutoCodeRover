Based on the context and the issue at hand, which involves enhancing the accessibility and usability of version comparison features in the matplotlib project, here are the proposed modifications:

### Modification 1: Enhancing `__version_tuple__` in `lib/matplotlib/_ version.py`
Given that `__version_tuple__` is already present but perhaps not well-documented or widely known, the first modification involves ensuring this feature is more accessible and also considering a name change to `version_info` for clarity and consistency with common practices.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
__version__ = version = "3.5.0.dev1324+gb7%2d7%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1%2d1
