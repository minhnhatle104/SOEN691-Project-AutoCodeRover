Based on the provided code and the issue at hand, it appears the issue might be related to how symbols are sorted and grouped, leading to multiple "Symbols" sections. The original logic for determining whether an entry falls under "Symbols" or not might not be handling all symbols consistently, especially considering the unique handling for symbols and alphabetic characters. Let's propose a patch that ensures all symbol entries are grouped under a single "Symbols" section by adjusting the sorting logic to treat all non-alphabetic and non-underscore characters uniformly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py</file>
<original>if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):
                lckey = chr(127) + lckey</original>
<patched>if not lckey[0:1].isalpha() and not lckey.startswith('_'):
                # Prefix all non-alphabetic and non-underscore characters with a common prefix
                # to ensure they are grouped together under "Symbols"
                lckey = '0' + lckey
            else:
                lckey = '1' + lckey</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py</file>
<original>if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):
                key = chr(127) + key</original>
<patched>if not key[0:1].isalpha() and not key.startswith('_'):
                # Adjust the sorting logic for keys to ensure symbols are grouped together
                key = '0' + key
            else:
                key = '1' + key</patched>
```

These modifications address the sorting logic by ensuring that all symbols (entries not starting with an alphabetic character or underscore) are prefixed in a way that groups them together, ahead of alphabetic entries. This approach should prevent the creation of multiple "Symbols" sections by treating all symbols uniformly in the sorting process. The use of '0' and '1' prefixes is to ensure symbols are sorted before alphabetic entries, as originally intended, but now without creating separate sections for different symbols.
