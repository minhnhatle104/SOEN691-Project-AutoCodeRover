            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to understand how the index entries are processed and how the HTML output is generated, particularly for the symbols section. Given the description of the issue, it seems relevant to look into the parts of the code that handle index entry categorization and HTML anchor generation. Therefore, I will start by searching for methods or code snippets that might be involved in these processes.\n\n1. To find out how index entries are categorized, especially those with special leading characters like `@`, `\u00a3`, and `\u2190`, I will search for methods that might be responsible for sorting or categorizing index entries. This could involve methods with names like `sortIndexEntries`, `categorizeIndexEntries`, or similar.\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that there are two sections called \"Symbols\" in the HTML output and there's a problem with HTML anchors, I will also look for methods that generate the HTML output for the index, possibly involving anchor generation. Methods with names like `generateHTML`, `createIndexSection`, or `generateAnchor` could be relevant.\n\n3. Additionally, searching for code snippets that directly mention \"Symbols\" could help identify where in the code the sections are being created or named.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"sortIndexEntries\")`\n- `search_method(\"categorizeIndexEntries\")`\n- `search_method(\"generateHTML\")`\n- `search_method(\"createIndexSection\")`\n- `search_method(\"generateAnchor\")`\n- `search_code(\"Symbols\")`"
