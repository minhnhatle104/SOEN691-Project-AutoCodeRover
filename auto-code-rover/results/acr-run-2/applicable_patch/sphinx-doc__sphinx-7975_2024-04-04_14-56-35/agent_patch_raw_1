Based on the issue description and the code provided, the problem seems to stem from how symbols are categorized and how the "Symbols" section is generated, particularly in the `keyfunc3` function where it decides whether an entry should be placed under the "Symbols" heading. The issue is that all non-alphabetic and non-underscore characters should be grouped under a single "Symbols" section, but due to the sorting logic, they end up in separate sections. Here's a proposed patch to ensure that all symbols are grouped together under a single "Symbols" section and have a unique anchor.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py</file>
<original>if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':
                return letter
            else:
                # get all other symbols under one heading
                return _('Symbols')</original>
<patched>if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':
                return letter
            else:
                # Ensure all symbols are grouped under a single "Symbols" heading
                # by returning a constant value for any non-alphabetic and non-underscore character
                return 'Symbols'</patched>
```

This modification changes the return value for non-alphabetic and non-underscore characters from `_('Symbols')` to a constant `'Symbols'`. This is to ensure that the localization function `_()` does not create variations in the "Symbols" heading due to different locales, which could potentially lead to the issue if the sorting or grouping behaves unexpectedly with localized strings. By returning a constant string `'Symbols'`, we ensure that all symbols are grouped under a single heading.

Please note, this patch assumes that the localization of the "Symbols" heading is not required or that it can be handled uniformly elsewhere in the code to maintain consistency across different locales. If localization of the "Symbols" heading is necessary, additional steps may be needed to ensure that the localized headings are treated uniformly in the sorting and grouping logic.
