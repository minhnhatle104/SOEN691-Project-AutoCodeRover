        >>> from sympy.geometry.point import Point

        When sequences of coordinates are passed to Point methods, they
        are converted to a Point internally. This __add__ method does
        not do that so if floating point values are used, a floating
        point result (in terms of SymPy Floats) will be returned.

        >>> Point(1, 2) + (.1, .2)
        Point2D(1.1, 2.2)

        If this is not desired, the `translate` method can be used or
        another Point can be added:

        >>> Point(1, 2).translate(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
        >>> Point(1, 2) + Point(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
