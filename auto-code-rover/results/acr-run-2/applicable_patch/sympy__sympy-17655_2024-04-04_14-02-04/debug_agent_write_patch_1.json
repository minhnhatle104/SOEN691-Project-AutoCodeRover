The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    \"\"\"\n    is_sympy = getattr(a, '__sympy__', None)\n    if is_sympy is not None:\n        return a\n\n    if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n    cls = getattr(a, \"__class__\", None)\n    if cls is None:\n        cls = type(a)  # Probably an old-style class\n    conv = converter.get(cls, None)\n    if conv is not None:\n        return conv(a)\n\n    for superclass in getmro(cls):\n        try:\n            return converter[superclass](a)\n        except KeyError:\n            continue\n\n    if cls is type(None):\n        if strict:\n            raise SympifyError(a)\n        else:\n            return a\n\n    if evaluate is None:\n        if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n            evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n        else:\n            evaluate = True\n\n    # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n    # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n    if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n        import numpy as np\n        if np.isscalar(a):\n            return _convert_numpy_types(a, locals=locals,\n                convert_xor=convert_xor, strict=strict, rational=rational,\n                evaluate=evaluate)\n\n    _sympy_ = getattr(a, \"_sympy_\", None)\n    if _sympy_ is not None:\n        try:\n            return a._sympy_()\n        # XXX: Catches AttributeError: 'SympyConverter' object has no\n        # attribute 'tuple'\n        # This is probably a bug somewhere but for now we catch it here.\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n\n    if not strict:\n        # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n        # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n        flat = getattr(a, \"flat\", None)\n        if flat is not None:\n            shape = getattr(a, \"shape\", None)\n            if shape is not None:\n                from ..tensor.array import Array\n                return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n\n    if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n        for coerce in (float, int):\n            try:\n                coerced = coerce(a)\n            except (TypeError, ValueError):\n                continue\n            # XXX: AttributeError only needed here for Py2\n            except AttributeError:\n                continue\n            try:\n                return sympify(coerced)\n            except SympifyError:\n                continue\n\n    if strict:\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    if iterable(a):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n    if isinstance(a, dict):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n\n    # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n    # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n    # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n    # anything to SymPy expression).\n    #\n    # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n    # and try to parse it.

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we can analyze the context and behavior of the `Point` class, its `__add__` and `__mul__` methods, and the `sympify` function to understand the root cause of the issue reported.\n\n### Analysis of the `Point` Class and Its Methods\n\n1. **Point Class (`sympy/geometry/point.py`)**: The `Point` class is a fundamental part of the SymPy geometry module. It represents a point in a geometric space and is used extensively across different geometric computations.\n\n2. **`__add__` Method**: The `__add__` method in the `Point` class is designed to add the coordinates of two points or a point and a tuple representing coordinates. This method does not automatically convert sequences of coordinates into a `Point` object unless explicitly done so. It also mentions that if floating point values are used, the result will be in terms of SymPy Floats. The method attempts to normalize the dimensions of the operands and then performs coordinate-wise addition.\n\n3. **`__mul__` Method**: The `__mul__` method allows a `Point` object's coordinates to be multiplied by a factor. The factor is first sympified, and then each coordinate of the point is multiplied by this factor. This method ensures that the multiplication operation is applied to each coordinate of the point, returning a new `Point` object with the scaled coordinates.\n\n4. **`sympify` Function (`sympy/core/sympify.py`)**: The `sympify` function is designed to convert an arbitrary expression into a type that can be used inside SymPy. It converts Python numeric types into their SymPy equivalents (e.g., Python `int` to `sympy.Integer`, Python `float` to `sympy.Float`). It also handles strings, booleans, and collections containing convertible elements. The function uses `eval` internally and supports various options for controlling the conversion process.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\nThe issue arises when attempting to perform an operation that involves multiplying a `Point` object by a number (after sympifying the number) and then adding it to another `Point` object. The first operation (`point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`) works as expected because the multiplication happens first, creating a new `Point` object with scaled coordinates, which is then added to `point1`.\n\nHowever, the problematic operation (`point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`) fails because the addition operation tries to execute before the multiplication due to Python's operator precedence. This leads to an attempt to add a `Point` object to a `Mul` object (which represents an unevaluated multiplication), causing the `__add__` method to raise a `GeometryError` due to type incompatibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe root cause of the issue is related to the operator precedence and the way the `__add__` method in the `Point` class handles operands of incompatible types. A potential solution would involve enhancing the `__add__` method to handle cases where one of the operands is a `Mul` object involving a `Point`, or ensuring that operations are performed in the correct order by the user (e.g., by using parentheses to enforce the desired operation order)."
