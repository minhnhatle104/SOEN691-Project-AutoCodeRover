Additionally, understanding how `sympify` interacts with these operations could provide insight into the cause of the exception. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Point\")`: This will help us understand the structure of the `Point` class, including any relevant methods that might be involved in the operations causing the issue.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__add__\", \"Point\")`: Since the issue occurs during an addition operation, examining the implementation of the `__add__` method in the `Point` class is crucial.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__mul__\", \"Point\")`: Given that the issue arises when a `Point` object is multiplied by a number, understanding how the `__mul__` method is implemented in the `Point` class could provide insights.\n\n4. `search_method(\"sympify\")`: This will help us understand how `sympify` works and how it might affect the operations between `Point` objects and numbers."
