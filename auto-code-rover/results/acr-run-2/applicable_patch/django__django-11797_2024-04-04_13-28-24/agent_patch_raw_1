Given the context and the issue described, a precise patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the Django ORM's internals and the specific project requirements. However, I can propose a conceptual approach to address the issue based on the provided code snippets and the problem description.

The issue seems to stem from how Django's ORM handles `GROUP BY` clauses, especially when `annotate()` and `values()` methods are used in conjunction. The problem is that the expected `GROUP BY` behavior changes unexpectedly when filtering on the result of a subquery that includes a `GROUP BY` clause.

A potential solution could involve ensuring that the `GROUP BY` clause of a subquery is preserved and correctly applied in the context of the outer query. This might require modifications in how the `get_group_by` method constructs the `GROUP BY` clause, particularly in ensuring that it respects the `GROUP BY` clause of subqueries.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</file>
<original>if self.query.group_by is None:
    return []</original>
<patched># Check if the query is a subquery and preserve its group_by if present
if self.query.group_by is None:
    if self.query.is_subquery and self.query.subquery_group_by:
        return self.query.subquery_group_by
    return []</patched>
```

This modification introduces a conceptual change where, if the current query is identified as a subquery and it has a specific `group_by` clause defined (`subquery_group_by` is a hypothetical attribute representing this), then this `group_by` clause is preserved and used instead of defaulting to an empty list. Note that `is_subquery` and `subquery_group_by` are not existing attributes; this approach assumes modifications or extensions to the Django ORM to support this behavior.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>self.group_by = tuple(group_by)</original>
<patched># Extend the group_by tuple with additional logic to handle subqueries
# This is a placeholder for logic that ensures subquery group_by clauses are correctly handled
self.group_by = self.adjust_group_by_for_subqueries(group_by)</patched>
```

In this hypothetical modification, `adjust_group_by_for_subqueries` is a method that would need to be implemented. It's intended to adjust the `group_by` clause for subqueries, ensuring that the `GROUP BY` clause from subqueries is correctly integrated into the outer query.

Please note, these modifications are conceptual and intended to illustrate a potential approach to solving the issue based on the information provided. Implementing these changes would require a deeper modification of Django's ORM, including adding support for recognizing and preserving `GROUP BY` clauses from subqueries. This would likely involve more extensive changes to both the ORM's internal query construction logic and its API to expose the necessary functionality.
