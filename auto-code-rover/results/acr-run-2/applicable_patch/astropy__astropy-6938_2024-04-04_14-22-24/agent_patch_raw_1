<file>astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py</file>
<original>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</original>
<patched>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field[:] = np.char.replace(output_field, encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the replacement operation affects the `output_field` array directly. The use of `output_field[:] =` ensures that the changes are made in-place on the existing array rather than creating a new array that is not used. Additionally, this approach leverages `np.char.replace` for the replacement operation, which is more appropriate for operations on NumPy character arrays. This change assumes that `output_field` is a NumPy array and that `np` (NumPy) is already imported in the context of this file. If not, an import statement for NumPy would need to be added at the beginning of the file.
