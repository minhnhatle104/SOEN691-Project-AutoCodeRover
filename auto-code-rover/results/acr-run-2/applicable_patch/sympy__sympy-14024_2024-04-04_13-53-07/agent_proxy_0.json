Specifically, we should focus on the `simplify` method and how symbols and expressions are handled in the codebase, especially for operations involving powers and simplification of expressions with symbolic and integer values. Let's start by looking into the `simplify` method and the `Symbol` class, as these are directly mentioned in the issue.\n\n- `search_method(\"simplify\")`: This will help us understand how the `simplify` method works and where it is located in the codebase.\n- `search_class(\"Symbol\")`: Since the issue involves the creation of symbols with specific properties (integer and positive), understanding the `Symbol` class will provide insights into how these properties are interpreted and used in expressions."
