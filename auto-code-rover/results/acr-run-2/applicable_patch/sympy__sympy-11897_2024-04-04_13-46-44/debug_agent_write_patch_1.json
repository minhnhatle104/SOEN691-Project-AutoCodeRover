Given the information in the issue, it seems relevant to look into the methods responsible for LaTeX and pretty printing. The `latex` and `pprint` functions are directly mentioned, so we should start by investigating these. Additionally, understanding how variables and expressions are parsed and printed could be crucial, so looking into the implementation of `var` might also be helpful.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"latex\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the LaTeX printer and understand how it generates the output for expressions.\n2. `search_method(\"pprint\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the pretty printer and compare its handling of expressions to that of the LaTeX printer.\n3. `search_method(\"var\")`: Since the issue mentions the use of `var` to declare variables and its potential impact on printing, understanding its implementation could provide insights into how assumptions about variables affect printing."

This could imply that pretty printing might be handled differently or is part of a larger system not directly exposed through a method with that name. It's also possible that pretty printing is facilitated by a different mechanism or library that wasn't directly identified through the search.\n\n3. **Variable Declaration (`var` function)**:\n   - Located in `sympy/core/symbol.py`.\n   - Creates symbols and injects them into the global namespace.\n   - Calls `symbols` with the same arguments and puts the results into the global namespace.\n   - Supports passing arguments to define properties of the symbols, such as `real=True`.\n   - The function is designed for interactive use rather than library code, where `symbols` is recommended.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around the way expressions are converted to strings for display in LaTeX and pretty print formats. The inconsistency between these two formats might stem from differences in how the `LatexPrinter` class and the pretty printing mechanism handle expressions, especially in terms of formatting fractions, function brackets, and multiplication symbols.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to:\n- Investigate the settings and defaults used by the `LatexPrinter` to see if adjustments or additional options could align its output more closely with that of the pretty printer.\n- Since the `pprint` function wasn't directly found, understanding the pretty printing mechanism (possibly by looking for related classes or functions) would be necessary to compare its formatting rules with those of the LaTeX printer.\n- Consider the role of symbol assumptions (like `positive=True` for variables) in printing and whether these should indeed affect the output format.\n\nFurther steps could involve reviewing the pretty printing system's implementation details (once identified) and proposing changes to either or both printing mechanisms to ensure consistency where appropriate, while still leveraging LaTeX's capabilities for more complex expressions."

This class defines how different expressions and symbols are formatted in a way that is meant to be visually appealing and easy to read.\n- The `latex` function, on the other hand, is designed to convert expressions to LaTeX format, which is used for typesetting mathematical content. The `latex` function's behavior is influenced by various settings that can adjust the output, such as using different symbols for multiplication or changing the way fractions are displayed.\n\n### Bug Locations\nGiven the information about how both printing systems are implemented, the inconsistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers likely arises from differences in how these two systems handle certain expressions. Specifically:\n- **LaTeX Printer (`latex` function)**: The way LaTeX handles expressions can be highly customizable, and the output can vary significantly based on the settings passed to the `latex` function. The default behavior and settings might lead to representations that differ from what is expected in a pretty-printed format.\n- **Pretty Printer (`PrettyPrinter` class)**: The pretty printer has its own set of rules and methods for rendering expressions, which do not necessarily align with LaTeX conventions or the customizable aspects of the LaTeX printer.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo address the inconsistency issue, one would need to review and possibly align the settings and defaults used by both printers for specific types of expressions. This might involve:\n- Adjusting the `PrettyPrinter` methods to ensure that the output more closely matches the LaTeX representation where appropriate.\n- Modifying the `latex` function's settings or its handling of expressions to align with the pretty printer's output, especially for cases where the LaTeX output is expected to be similar to the pretty-printed format.\n\nThe exact changes would depend on the specific inconsistencies reported and the project's goals regarding the balance between leveraging LaTeX's capabilities and maintaining consistency with pretty-printed output."

The issue seems to be more about enhancing the feature set or adjusting the behavior of the printers to align with each other better, rather than fixing a specific bug in the code. However, I can suggest a conceptual patch that aims to introduce a mechanism for ensuring consistency between the two printers for a specific case mentioned in the issue: the printing of fractions and expressions involving `exp` and `log`.\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>\n<original>\ndef latex(expr, **settings):\n    ...\n    return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)\n</original>\n<patched>\ndef latex(expr, **settings):\n    ...\n    # Introduce a new setting to enforce consistency with pretty printing\n    settings.setdefault('ensure_pretty_consistency', False)\n    if settings['ensure_pretty_consistency']:\n        # Adjust settings known to cause inconsistencies\n        settings['fold_frac_powers'] = True\n        settings['fold_func_brackets'] = True\n        settings['fold_short_frac'] = True\n    return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)\n</patched>\n```\n\n# modification 2\n```python\n<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>\n<original>\ndef doprint(self, expr):\n    return self._print(expr).render(**self._settings)\n</original>\n<patched>\ndef doprint(self, expr):\n    # Ensure settings are adjusted for consistency with LaTeX printing\n    self._settings.setdefault('fold_frac_powers', True)\n    self._settings.setdefault('fold_func_brackets', True)\n    self._settings.setdefault('fold_short_frac', True)\n    return self._print(expr).render(**self._settings)\n</patched>\n```\n\nThese modifications introduce a conceptual approach to handling the issue by adding a mechanism to enforce consistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers through settings. In the LaTeX printer, a new setting `ensure_pretty_consistency` is introduced, which, when enabled, adjusts other settings known to cause inconsistencies. Similarly, in the pretty printer, the settings are adjusted to match those of the LaTeX printer when consistency is desired.\n\nIt's important to note that these changes are conceptual and would need to be tested and refined to ensure they address the specific inconsistencies mentioned in the issue without introducing new issues. Further, this approach assumes that the settings causing inconsistencies are well understood and that adjusting them can indeed bring the desired consistency."
