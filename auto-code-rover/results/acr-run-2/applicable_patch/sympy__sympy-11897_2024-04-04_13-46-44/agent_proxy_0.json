            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the LaTeX and pretty printers are implemented and how they handle expressions like `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. Given the information in the issue, it seems relevant to look into the methods responsible for LaTeX and pretty printing. The `latex` and `pprint` functions are directly mentioned, so we should start by investigating these. Additionally, understanding how variables and expressions are parsed and printed could be crucial, so looking into the implementation of `var` might also be helpful.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"latex\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the LaTeX printer and understand how it generates the output for expressions.\n2. `search_method(\"pprint\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the pretty printer and compare its handling of expressions to that of the LaTeX printer.\n3. `search_method(\"var\")`: Since the issue mentions the use of `var` to declare variables and its potential impact on printing, understanding its implementation could provide insights into how assumptions about variables affect printing."
