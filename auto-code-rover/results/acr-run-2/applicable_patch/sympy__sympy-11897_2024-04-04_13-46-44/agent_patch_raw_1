Given the nature of the issue, which is about inconsistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers, a direct patch may not be straightforward without specific rules or guidelines on how these inconsistencies should be resolved. The issue seems to be more about enhancing the feature set or adjusting the behavior of the printers to align with each other better, rather than fixing a specific bug in the code. However, I can suggest a conceptual patch that aims to introduce a mechanism for ensuring consistency between the two printers for a specific case mentioned in the issue: the printing of fractions and expressions involving `exp` and `log`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>
def latex(expr, **settings):
    ...
    return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)
</original>
<patched>
def latex(expr, **settings):
    ...
    # Introduce a new setting to enforce consistency with pretty printing
    settings.setdefault('ensure_pretty_consistency', False)
    if settings['ensure_pretty_consistency']:
        # Adjust settings known to cause inconsistencies
        settings['fold_frac_powers'] = True
        settings['fold_func_brackets'] = True
        settings['fold_short_frac'] = True
    return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>
def doprint(self, expr):
    return self._print(expr).render(**self._settings)
</original>
<patched>
def doprint(self, expr):
    # Ensure settings are adjusted for consistency with LaTeX printing
    self._settings.setdefault('fold_frac_powers', True)
    self._settings.setdefault('fold_func_brackets', True)
    self._settings.setdefault('fold_short_frac', True)
    return self._print(expr).render(**self._settings)
</patched>
```

These modifications introduce a conceptual approach to handling the issue by adding a mechanism to enforce consistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers through settings. In the LaTeX printer, a new setting `ensure_pretty_consistency` is introduced, which, when enabled, adjusts other settings known to cause inconsistencies. Similarly, in the pretty printer, the settings are adjusted to match those of the LaTeX printer when consistency is desired.

It's important to note that these changes are conceptual and would need to be tested and refined to ensure they address the specific inconsistencies mentioned in the issue without introducing new issues. Further, this approach assumes that the settings causing inconsistencies are well understood and that adjusting them can indeed bring the desired consistency.
