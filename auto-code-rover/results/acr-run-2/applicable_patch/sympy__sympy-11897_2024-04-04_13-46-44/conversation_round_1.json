Given the information in the issue, it seems relevant to look into the methods responsible for LaTeX and pretty printing. The `latex` and `pprint` functions are directly mentioned, so we should start by investigating these. Additionally, understanding how variables and expressions are parsed and printed could be crucial, so looking into the implementation of `var` might also be helpful.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"latex\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the LaTeX printer and understand how it generates the output for expressions.\n2. `search_method(\"pprint\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the pretty printer and compare its handling of expressions to that of the LaTeX printer.\n3. `search_method(\"var\")`: Since the issue mentions the use of `var` to declare variables and its potential impact on printing, understanding its implementation could provide insights into how assumptions about variables affect printing."

This could imply that pretty printing might be handled differently or is part of a larger system not directly exposed through a method with that name. It's also possible that pretty printing is facilitated by a different mechanism or library that wasn't directly identified through the search.\n\n3. **Variable Declaration (`var` function)**:\n   - Located in `sympy/core/symbol.py`.\n   - Creates symbols and injects them into the global namespace.\n   - Calls `symbols` with the same arguments and puts the results into the global namespace.\n   - Supports passing arguments to define properties of the symbols, such as `real=True`.\n   - The function is designed for interactive use rather than library code, where `symbols` is recommended.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around the way expressions are converted to strings for display in LaTeX and pretty print formats. The inconsistency between these two formats might stem from differences in how the `LatexPrinter` class and the pretty printing mechanism handle expressions, especially in terms of formatting fractions, function brackets, and multiplication symbols.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to:\n- Investigate the settings and defaults used by the `LatexPrinter` to see if adjustments or additional options could align its output more closely with that of the pretty printer.\n- Since the `pprint` function wasn't directly found, understanding the pretty printing mechanism (possibly by looking for related classes or functions) would be necessary to compare its formatting rules with those of the LaTeX printer.\n- Consider the role of symbol assumptions (like `positive=True` for variables) in printing and whether these should indeed affect the output format.\n\nFurther steps could involve reviewing the pretty printing system's implementation details (once identified) and proposing changes to either or both printing mechanisms to ensure consistency where appropriate, while still leveraging LaTeX's capabilities for more complex expressions."
