These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation in both the `__new__` method and the `_handle_finite_sets` method of the `Intersection` class. This should lead to canonical processing and correct evaluation behavior, especially in cases involving symbolic elements or conditions that were not handled properly before.
