Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how `SomeClass` is implemented and used, as well as any custom behavior in the `__getattribute__` and `__repr__` methods that could be causing the issue. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SomeClass\")`: This will help me understand the broader context of `SomeClass`, including its inheritance, methods, and any relevant comments that might hint at why exceptions are being raised in `__getattribute__` and `__repr__`.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__getattribute__\", \"SomeClass\")`: Since the issue occurs when accessing an attribute, I want to see the implementation details of `__getattribute__` in `SomeClass` to understand why it's raising an exception.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"SomeClass\")`: Given that the issue also involves an exception in the `__repr__` method, I need to review its implementation to identify potential causes for the exception.\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive view of the problem area, allowing me to diagnose and propose a solution effectively."
