        "content": "The issue describes a problem with the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in the `requests` library, where the method incorrectly handles HTTP method changes during redirection chains. Specifically, the issue occurs when a POST request is redirected with a 303 See Other response, which should change the method to GET, but if followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect, the method should remain as GET. However, due to the method starting each iteration by copying the _original_ request object, the method incorrectly reverts to POST after the 307 redirect.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet of the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, we can see how the method processes redirects. The method iterates through each redirect response and prepares a new request for each redirect. It correctly handles the change from POST to GET for a 303 See Other response and other specific status codes by modifying the `method` variable. However, the issue arises because it uses `req.copy()` at the beginning of each iteration to create `prepared_request`, which is based on the original request object. This behavior does not account for the method change that might have occurred in a previous redirect.\n\nTo address this issue, the patch should ensure that the method change (e.g., from POST to GET after a 303 See Other response) is preserved in subsequent redirects, even when the original request object is copied for a new redirect. This might involve updating the logic to correctly carry over the modified HTTP method to the new request object created for following redirects."
