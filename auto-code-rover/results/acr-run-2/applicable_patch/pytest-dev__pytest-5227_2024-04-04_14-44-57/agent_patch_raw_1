Based on the issue description and the context retrieved from the search result, here is the proposed patch to address the issue of improving the default logging format by including the module name and adjusting the format for clarity.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/logging.py</file>
<original>DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s"</original>
<patched>DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s"</patched>
```

This modification updates the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` to include the module name (`%(name)s`) and restructures the format to place the log level at the beginning, followed by the module and filename, line number, and the log message. This change addresses the issue's request for more informative logging by incorporating the module name directly into the log format.
