This file seems to be part of the logging configuration for pytest, a testing framework for Python. The current format includes the filename, line number, log level, and the log message. The issue suggests replacing the filename with the module name and possibly including the relative path to make the logs more informative.\n\nGiven this context, the proposed change to include the module name (`name`) and potentially adjust the format to incorporate the relative path or environment variables like `$VIRTUAL_ENV` requires us to modify the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in `src/_pytest/logging.py`. However, to ensure that the proposed changes will not break existing functionality or to understand how the logging is set up, we might need to look further into how `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is used throughout the project, especially in the logging setup.\n\nSince the issue specifically mentions the desire to include the module name and possibly manipulate the path to be more readable or shorter, we should consider the following steps for the patch:\n\n1. **Modify the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`**: This involves changing the format string to include `%(name)s` for the module name and possibly adjusting the format to handle paths more elegantly. The issue suggests a format of `"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s"`, which we can start with.\n\n2. **Consider Path Shortening or Substitution**: If we want to include the relative path or perform substitutions like replacing the `$VIRTUAL_ENV` path with a placeholder, we might need to implement a custom logging Formatter that can handle these transformations. This could involve subclassing `logging.Formatter` and overriding the `format` method to manipulate the `filename` or `pathname` before formatting the log record.\n\n3. **Review and Test**: After making changes, it\'s crucial to review the impact on the logging output across different parts of the project and ensure that the new format provides the intended clarity without introducing any regressions.\n\nGiven the current context, we have enough information to start drafting a patch for the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` change. If we decide to implement path shortening or substitution, we may need to explore further into how logging is set up in `src/_pytest/logging.py` or if there are custom logging formatters already in use that we can extend.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
