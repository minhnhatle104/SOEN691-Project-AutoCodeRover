Since the issue mentions a change in behavior between versions 1.0 and 1.1 of `sympy` when using these methods, it's crucial to look into their implementations and any related code that might have influenced this change. \n\nGiven the information, the following API calls would be necessary to gather more context and potentially identify the source of the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the `Matrix` class**: Since the issue is related to the `Matrix` class's `hstack` and `vstack` methods, it's essential to find where this class is defined in the codebase.\n   - `search_class(\"Matrix\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `hstack` method in the `Matrix` class**: Understanding how `hstack` is implemented will help us see if there were any changes in its behavior or its handling of matrices with zero rows or columns.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"hstack\", \"Matrix\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `vstack` method in the `Matrix` class**: Similarly, investigating the `vstack` method's implementation might provide insights, even though the issue explicitly mentions `hstack`. It's useful to check if both methods have undergone similar changes that could affect their behavior.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"vstack\", \"Matrix\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and identifying potential solutions."

        "content": "Given the results indicating that the `Matrix` class and the methods `hstack` and `vstack` could not be found in the codebase, it suggests a couple of possibilities:\n\n1. **Incorrect Class Name**: It's possible that the `Matrix` class is not directly named \"Matrix\" in the codebase or exists within a module or a namespace that wasn't specified in the search query. This can often happen in large libraries like `sympy` where classes might be organized into submodules.\n\n2. **Dynamic Import or Alias**: The `Matrix` class or its methods might be dynamically imported or aliased, making it difficult to find with a direct search. This is common in Python projects for managing large codebases or for providing backward compatibility.\n\n3. **External Dependency**: The `Matrix` class might be part of an external dependency not directly visible in the primary codebase, or it might be generated at runtime, making static analysis challenging.\n\nGiven these possibilities, we should adjust our approach to gather more context. Here are a few alternative strategies:\n\n- **Search for the `Matrix` class using a broader query**: Instead of searching for the class directly, we could search for files or modules that are likely to define or use the `Matrix` class. This could involve searching for terms like \"matrix\" or \"linear algebra\" which are conceptually related to the `Matrix` class.\n\n- **Search for method implementations directly**: Since searching for the methods within the `Matrix` class didn't yield results, we could try searching for the `hstack` and `vstack` methods directly in the entire codebase. This approach bypasses the need to locate the class first and might reveal where these methods are implemented or used.\n\n- **Review documentation or external resources**: Sometimes, reviewing the project's documentation or external resources like GitHub repositories can provide clues about the organization of the codebase or changes between versions.\n\nGiven the limitations of the initial approach, I recommend trying to search for the methods directly in the entire codebase and looking for any code snippets related to matrix stacking operations. This might provide us with the necessary context to understand the issue and devise a solution.\n\nWould you like to proceed with these alternative strategies?"
