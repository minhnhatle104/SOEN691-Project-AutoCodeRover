            "content": "To analyze the issue effectively, we need to understand how `hstack` and `vstack` methods are implemented in the `sympy` library, specifically within the context of the `Matrix` class. Since the issue mentions a change in behavior between versions 1.0 and 1.1 of `sympy` when using these methods, it's crucial to look into their implementations and any related code that might have influenced this change. \n\nGiven the information, the following API calls would be necessary to gather more context and potentially identify the source of the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the `Matrix` class**: Since the issue is related to the `Matrix` class's `hstack` and `vstack` methods, it's essential to find where this class is defined in the codebase.\n   - `search_class(\"Matrix\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `hstack` method in the `Matrix` class**: Understanding how `hstack` is implemented will help us see if there were any changes in its behavior or its handling of matrices with zero rows or columns.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"hstack\", \"Matrix\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `vstack` method in the `Matrix` class**: Similarly, investigating the `vstack` method's implementation might provide insights, even though the issue explicitly mentions `hstack`. It's useful to check if both methods have undergone similar changes that could affect their behavior.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"vstack\", \"Matrix\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and identifying potential solutions."
