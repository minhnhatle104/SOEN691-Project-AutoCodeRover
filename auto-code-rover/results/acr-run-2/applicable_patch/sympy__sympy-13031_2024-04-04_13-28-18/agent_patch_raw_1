**Explanation**: The issue described involves an unexpected change in behavior between versions of `sympy` when using `hstack` with matrices that have zero rows or columns. The provided code snippets from `row_join` and `col_join` methods contain conditions that seem to handle cases where matrices have zero columns or rows in a way that might not align with the expected behavior for `hstack` and `vstack`. Specifically, these conditions could lead to ignoring the dimensions of matrices with zero rows or columns, which contradicts the expected outcome described in the issue.

The proposed modifications suggest removing or revising these conditions to ensure that matrices with zero dimensions are correctly accounted for when computing the dimensions of the resulting matrix after horizontal or vertical stacking. However, without the exact patched code to replace the original conditions, the next step would involve implementing a fix that correctly handles zero-dimensional matrices in both `row_join` and `col_join` methods, ensuring that their dimensions are considered in the resulting matrix's size calculation. This approach would align with the expected behavior where the dimensions of all matrices, including those with zero rows or columns, contribute to the overall dimensions of the stacked matrix.
