This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\n```\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\n```\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\n```\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\n```python\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\napp.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\n```\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information retrieved from the `Config` class's `from_file` method in Flask, we can see how the method currently operates and why it doesn't support binary mode file reading, which is necessary for using `tomllib.load` with Python 3.11's native TOML support.\n\nHere's a summary of the current implementation details and the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Current Implementation**:\n    - The `from_file` method is designed to update the Flask app's configuration from a file. It takes a filename, a callable (`load`) that processes the file content into a mapping (like a dictionary), and a `silent` flag that controls error handling if the file doesn't exist.\n    - The file is opened in text mode by default (`with open(filename) as f:`), which is suitable for JSON or Python files but not for binary files like TOML files expected by `tomllib.load`.\n\n2. **Issue**:\n    - The `tomllib.load` function requires the file to be opened in binary mode (`'rb'`), but `from_file` opens the file in text mode without any option to change this behavior.\n    - This mismatch results in a `TypeError` when attempting to use `tomllib.load` directly with `from_file`.\n\n3. **Proposed Solution**:\n    - The issue suggests adding a file mode parameter to `from_file`, allowing the method to open the file in binary mode when needed. This would enable direct support for loading TOML configuration files using `tomllib.load` in a concise and convenient manner.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to modify the `from_file` method in the `Config` class to accept an additional parameter for the file mode and use this parameter when opening the file. This change would make the method more flexible and capable of supporting different file formats that may require different modes for reading."
