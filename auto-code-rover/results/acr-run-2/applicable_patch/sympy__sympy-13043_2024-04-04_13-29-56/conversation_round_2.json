        "content": "Given the information from the search results, the `decompose()` method appears in several files across the codebase, with one match specifically in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`, which is directly related to the issue described. The issue mentions that the `decompose()` function, when called with `separate=True`, returns a list of values from a dictionary (`poly_dict`) in an arbitrary order. This behavior is causing test failures, suggesting that the order of elements in the returned list is significant for the caller or for subsequent operations.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that the output of the `decompose()` function is predictable and ordered, if that's the intended behavior. The suggestion in the issue points towards either sorting the list or returning a set (though the latter would not guarantee order either and would remove duplicates, which might not be desirable). Another option is to question the necessity of converting the dictionary values to a list if the callers could directly work with the dictionary.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve:\n1. Reviewing the implementation of the `decompose()` method in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` to understand how the list is generated and used.\n2. Determining the intended use of the output list to decide whether it should be sorted or if another data structure would be more appropriate.\n3. Assessing the impact of changing the output type or order on existing callers of the function.\n\nTo proceed with these steps, we would need to look at the implementation of the `decompose()` method within `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` and possibly review how the method's output is used in tests or other parts of the codebase that might be affected by changes to its behavior.\n\nLet's start by examining the implementation of the `decompose()` method in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`:\n\n- **search_method_in_file(\"decompose\", \"sympy/integrals/intpoly.py\")**\n\nThis will provide the necessary details to understand the current implementation and to start formulating a patch to address the issue."
