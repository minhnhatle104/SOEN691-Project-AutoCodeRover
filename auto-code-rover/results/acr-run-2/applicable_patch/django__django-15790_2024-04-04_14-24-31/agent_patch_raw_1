        libraries[module_name].append(module_path)</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that a module path is only added to the `libraries` defaultdict for a given `module_name` if it is not already present. This change prevents the same module path from being counted multiple times for a single `module_name`, which was leading to the erroneous detection of duplicates as described in the issue.
