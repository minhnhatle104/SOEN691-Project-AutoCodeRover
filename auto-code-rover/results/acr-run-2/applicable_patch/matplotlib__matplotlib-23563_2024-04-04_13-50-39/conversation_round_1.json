When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console. I don't know why it happens, so I come here for help.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nx_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nx_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\ny_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\ny_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nz_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nz_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\nax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\nax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\nclr_list = 'r-'\nfor n in range(np.size(z_s_0, axis=0)):\nax.plot([int(x_s_0[n]), int(x_e_0[n])],\n[int(y_s_0[n]), int(y_e_0[n])],\n[int(z_s_0[n]), int(z_e_0[n])], clr_list)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\n# ax.zlabel('z')\nplt.title('90-0')\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 3444, in run_code\nexec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\nFile \"<ipython-input-80-e04907066a16>\", line 20, in <module>\nplt.show()\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 368, in show\nreturn _backend_mod.show(*args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 29, in __call__\nmanager.show(**kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 112, in show\nself.canvas.show()\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 68, in show\nFigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\", line 436, in draw\nself.figure.draw(self.renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 73, in draw_wrapper\nresult = draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py\", line 2803, in draw\nmimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\na.draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 469, in draw\nsuper().draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", line 3082, in draw\nmimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\na.draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 215, in draw\nxs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d\nAttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Expected outcome\nSome 3D lines\n### Additional information\n_No response_\n### Operating system\nLocal: windows + pycharm, Remote: Ubuntu 20.04\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.5.0\n### Matplotlib Backend\nmodule://backend_interagg\n### Python version\n3.8.12\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\npip\n</issue>"

The error message `AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'` suggests that there's an attempt to access an attribute `_verts3d` that either doesn't exist or isn't initialized properly in certain scenarios.\n\nGiven this, we should start by investigating the `Line3D` class and any methods that might interact with the `_verts3d` attribute. Additionally, since the error occurs during the drawing phase, it would be useful to look into the drawing method for the `Line3D` class or any related drawing routines in the 3D plotting context.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Line3D\")`: This will help us understand the structure of the `Line3D` class, including its attributes and methods.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"draw\", \"Line3D\")`: Since the error occurs during drawing, investigating the `draw` method in the `Line3D` class could provide insights into how `_verts3d` is used or expected to be initialized.\n3. `search_code(\"_verts3d\")`: This broad search for the `_verts3d` code snippet throughout the codebase can help us identify all the places where this attribute is accessed or modified, which might give us clues about its lifecycle and how it's supposed to be managed.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue and formulating a solution."

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, we can start analyzing the issue with the `Line3D` object in the matplotlib library, specifically within the 3D plotting toolkit (`mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`).\n\n1. **Class Definition and Methods**:\n   - The `Line3D` class is defined in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py`. It inherits from `lines.Line2D`, which is a part of matplotlib's 2D line drawing functionality.\n   - The `Line3D` class has several methods, including `__init__`, `set_3d_properties`, `set_data_3d`, `get_data_3d`, and `draw`. These methods are crucial for managing 3D line properties and rendering.\n\n2. **The `draw` Method**:\n   - The `draw` method in the `Line3D` class attempts to access the attribute `_verts3d` directly. This attribute is expected to contain the 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of the vertices that make up the line.\n   - After retrieving the 3D coordinates, it uses `proj3d.proj_transform` to transform these coordinates into a 2D projection that can be rendered on the screen. Then, it updates the line data with these 2D coordinates and calls the superclass's `draw` method to perform the actual rendering.\n   - The method concludes by setting `self.stale` to `False`, indicating that the current state has been rendered and is no longer \"stale\" or outdated.\n\n3. **Issue Analysis**:\n   - The error message `AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'` suggests that the `_verts3d` attribute is either not being properly initialized or is somehow being lost or overwritten during the execution flow.\n   - Since the `draw` method directly accesses `_verts3d` without any checks, if this attribute is not set (or is unset at some point), it would lead to the observed `AttributeError`.\n\n4. **Potential Solutions**:\n   - A patch might involve ensuring that `_verts3d` is correctly initialized and maintained throughout the lifecycle of the `Line3D` object. This could involve reviewing and possibly modifying the `__init__`, `set_3d_properties`, and `set_data_3d` methods to ensure they properly manage `_verts3d`.\n   - Another approach could be to modify the `draw` method to check for the existence of `_verts3d` and handle cases where it is not set. This could prevent the error but would require a decision on how to handle such cases (e.g., skip drawing the line, draw it with default coordinates, raise a more informative error, etc.).\n\nGiven the information from the search results, the next steps would involve diving deeper into the methods that are supposed to manage `_verts3d` (like `set_data_3d` and `set_3d_properties`) to understand how this attribute is expected to be managed and identifying where the process is breaking down."
