This can be useful in cooperation\n    with SAGE.\n\n    It currently accepts as arguments:\n       - any object defined in SymPy\n       - standard numeric python types: int, long, float, Decimal\n       - strings (like "0.09" or "2e-19")\n       - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)\n       - dict, lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above\n\n    .. warning::\n        Note that this function uses ``eval``, and thus shouldn\'t be used on\n        unsanitized input.\n\n    If the argument is already a type that SymPy understands, it will do\n    nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a\n    function to ensure you are working with the correct type.\n\n    >>> from sympy import sympify\n\n    >>> sympify(2).is_integer\n    True\n    >>> sympify(2).is_real\n    True\n\n    >>> sympify(2.0).is_real\n    True\n    >>> sympify("2.0").is_real\n    True\n    >>> sympify("2e-45").is_real\n    True\n\n    If the expression could not be converted, a SympifyError is raised.\n\n    >>> sympify("x***2")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    SympifyError: SympifyError: "could not parse u\'x***2\'"\n\n    Locals\n    ------\n\n    The sympification happens with access to everything that is loaded\n    by ``from sympy import *``; anything used in a string that is not\n    defined by that import will be converted to a symbol. In the following,\n    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n    interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises\n    an error when used improperly:\n\n    >>> s = \'bitcount(42)\'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    bitcount(42)\n    >>> sympify("O(x)")\n    O(x)\n    >>> sympify("O + 1")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    TypeError: unbound method...\n\n    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\n    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_\n    >>> ns = {}\n    >>> exec_(\'from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount\', ns)\n    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n    6\n\n    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns["O"] = Symbol("O")  # method 1\n    >>> exec_(\'from sympy.abc import O\', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol("O")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify("O + 1", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2\n    (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter\n    names that are defined in abc).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> _clash1\n    {\'C\': C, \'E\': E, \'I\': I, \'N\': N, \'O\': O, \'Q\': Q, \'S\': S}\n    >>> sympify(\'I & Q\', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other\n    cases, a SympifyError is raised.\n\n    >>> print(sympify(None))\n    None\n    >>> sympify(None, strict=True)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    SympifyError: SympifyError: None\n\n    Evaluation\n    ----------\n\n    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and\n    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the\n    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.\n\n    >>> sympify(\'2**2 / 3 + 5\')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify(\'2**2 / 3 + 5\', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered.

2024-04-04 14:40:00 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the information gathered from the search results, let's analyze the context and components involved in the issue:\n\n1. **Symbol Class**: The `Symbol` class, found in `sympy/core/symbol.py`, does not directly implement an `__eq__` method. This implies that the equality comparison fallbacks to a more generic implementation, possibly in a parent class or through the use of other mechanisms such as `sympify` to handle comparisons.\n\n2. **sympify Function**: Located in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, the `sympify` function is designed to convert arbitrary expressions into a form that can be used inside SymPy. It accepts a wide range of inputs, including strings, and attempts to parse and convert them into SymPy objects. Notably, the documentation warns that this function uses `eval`, which is a potential security concern when dealing with unsanitized input. The function tries to handle various cases and types, including strings, by attempting to parse them into SymPy expressions.\n\n3. **parse_expr Function**: There are two `parse_expr` functions found, one in `sympy/parsing/ast_parser.py` and another in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. The latter seems more relevant to our issue as it includes comprehensive handling for parsing strings into SymPy expressions, including managing local and global dictionaries, applying transformations, and controlling evaluation. It's designed to convert strings to SymPy expressions, considering various transformations and the evaluation flag to either simplify expressions automatically or keep them as entered.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nThe issue arises from the use of `eval` in the process of converting strings (or representations of objects) into SymPy expressions, specifically within the `sympify` function and possibly influenced by how `parse_expr` is utilized. This process is triggered during equality checks, where the representation (`repr`) of an object is evaluated without sufficient validation or sanitization, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to consider modifying the way `sympify` (and possibly `parse_expr`) handles string inputs, especially ensuring that the evaluation of object representations during equality checks is safe and does not execute arbitrary code. This might involve adding checks to avoid evaluating representations that do not correspond to valid SymPy expressions or implementing a more secure way to parse and compare objects without relying on `eval`.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns["O"] = Symbol("O")  # method 1\n    >>> exec_(\'from sympy.abc import O\', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol("O")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify("O + 1", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2\n    (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter\n    names that are defined in abc).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> _clash1\n    {\'C\': C, \'E\': E, \'I\': I, \'N\': N, \'O\': O, \'Q\': Q, \'S\': S}\n    >>> sympify(\'I & Q\', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other\n    cases, a SympifyError is raised.\n\n    >>> print(sympify(None))\n    None\n    >>> sympify(None, strict=True)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    SympifyError: SympifyError: None\n\n    Evaluation\n    ----------\n\n    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and\n    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the\n    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.\n\n    >>> sympify(\'2**2 / 3 + 5\')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify(\'2**2 / 3 + 5\', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = \'-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    """\n    is_sympy = getattr(a, \'__sympy__\', None)\n    if is_sympy is not None:\n        return a\n\n    if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n    cls = getattr(a, "__class__", None)\n    if cls is None:\n        cls = type(a)  # Probably an old-style class\n    conv = converter.get(cls, None)\n    if conv is not None:\n        return conv(a)\n\n    for superclass in getmro(cls):\n        try:\n            return converter[superclass](a)\n        except KeyError:\n            continue\n\n    if cls is type(None):\n        if strict:\n            raise SympifyError(a)\n        else:\n            return a\n\n    if evaluate is None:\n        if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n            evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n        else:\n            evaluate = True\n\n    # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n    # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n    if type(a).__module__ == \'numpy\':\n        import numpy as np\n        if np.isscalar(a):\n            return _convert_numpy_types(a, locals=locals,\n                convert_xor=convert_xor, strict=strict, rational=rational,\n                evaluate=evaluate)\n\n    _sympy_ = getattr(a, "_sympy_", None)\n    if _sympy_ is not None:\n        try:\n            return a._sympy_()\n        # XXX: Catches AttributeError: \'SympyConverter\' object has no\n        # attribute \'tuple\'\n        # This is probably a bug somewhere but for now we catch it here.\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n\n    if not strict:\n        # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n        # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n        flat = getattr(a, "flat", None)\n        if flat is not None:\n            shape = getattr(a, "shape", None)\n            if shape is not None:\n                from ..tensor.array import Array\n                return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n\n    if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n        for coerce in (float, int):\n            try:\n                coerced = coerce(a)\n            except (TypeError, ValueError):\n                continue\n            # XXX: AttributeError only needed here for Py2\n            except AttributeError:\n                continue\n            try:\n                return sympify(coerced)\n            except SympifyError:\n                continue\n\n    if strict:\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    if iterable(a):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n    if isinstance(a, dict):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n\n    # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n    # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn\'t implement\n    # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n    # anything to SymPy expression).\n    #\n    # As a last chance, we try to take "a"\'s normal form via unicode()\n    # and try to parse it.
