def safe_evaluation_check(s):
    """

    # Implement comprehensive checks to ensure the string `s` does not contain

```

**Note**: The `safe_evaluation_check` function in modification 2 is a placeholder and should be implemented with a comprehensive security check to ensure that the string does not contain potentially harmful expressions. This could involve regex checks, parsing the expression tree, etc. The current implementation returns `True` for demonstration purposes, but in a real scenario, it should include actual security checks.
