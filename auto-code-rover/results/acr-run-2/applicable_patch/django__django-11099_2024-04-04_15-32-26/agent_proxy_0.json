Given the information from the issue, it's clear that these validators are part of the authentication system, likely in a module related to user validation or authentication. The issue specifically mentions that these validators are in `contrib.auth.validators`, which gives us a starting point.\n\nTo gather more context and ensure we're making changes in the correct locations, we should:\n\n1. Search for the classes `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` to find their definitions and any relevant documentation or comments that might exist in the codebase.\n2. Search for the current regex pattern `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to find where it's being used in the codebase. This will help us identify all instances that need to be updated to the new pattern.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ASCIIUsernameValidator\")`\n2. `search_class(\"UnicodeUsernameValidator\")`\n3. `search_code(\"r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\")`\n\nThese calls will provide us with the necessary context to understand where and how these validators are implemented and where the regex pattern is used, ensuring we can accurately address the issue."
