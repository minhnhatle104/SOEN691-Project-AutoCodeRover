Given the error message "the '.' operator prohibited in index expressions" and the context provided by the code snippets from `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`, it seems the issue might be related to how SQLite handles certain expressions during schema alterations, particularly when unique constraints are involved. However, without a clear indication of misuse of the '.' operator in the provided snippets, crafting an exact patch is challenging. A common approach to handling such issues in Django's ORM layer, especially with database backends like SQLite that have specific limitations or behaviors, involves adjusting the SQL generation to accommodate these backend-specific quirks.

Since the direct cause of the error isn't explicitly visible in the provided snippets, I'll propose a hypothetical patch that aims to address potential issues in handling unique constraints during the `_remake_table` process. This patch would be speculative and aims to illustrate a possible direction for resolving the issue based on common practices for handling database backend-specific behaviors in Django.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py</file>
<original>cursor.execute('UPDATE sqlite_master SET sql = replace(sql, %s, %s)', (search, replacement))</original>
<patched># Before executing the replacement, ensure no prohibited operators are used in expressions
# This is a speculative fix and should be validated for the specific case
safe_search = search.replace('.', '__dot__')
safe_replacement = replacement.replace('.', '__dot__')
cursor.execute('UPDATE sqlite_master SET sql = replace(sql, %s, %s)', (safe_search, safe_replacement))</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py</file>
<original># Copy data from the old table into the new table
self.execute("INSERT INTO %s (%s) SELECT %s FROM %s" % (
    self.quote_name(new_model._meta.db_table),
    ', '.join(self.quote_name(x) for x in mapping),
    ', '.join(mapping.values()),
    self.quote_name(model._meta.db_table),
))</original>
<patched># Copy data from the old table into the new table, ensuring no prohibited operators are used
# This is a speculative fix and might need adjustment based on the specific error context
safe_mapping_values = [value.replace('.', '__dot__') for value in mapping.values()]
self.execute("INSERT INTO %s (%s) SELECT %s FROM %s" % (
    self.quote_name(new_model._meta.db_table),
    ', '.join(self.quote_name(x) for x in mapping),
    ', '.join(safe_mapping_values),
    self.quote_name(model._meta.db_table),
))</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are speculative and aim to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue based on the error message and common practices for handling backend-specific behaviors in Django. The actual resolution might require a deeper investigation into how Django constructs and executes SQL statements for schema alterations involving unique constraints on SQLite, and adjustments should be thoroughly tested across different scenarios to ensure they do not introduce regressions or other issues.
