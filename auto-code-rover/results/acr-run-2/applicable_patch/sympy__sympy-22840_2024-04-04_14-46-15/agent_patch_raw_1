Given the context and the nature of the issue with `cse()` having strange behavior for `MatrixSymbol` indexing, a potential patch would involve ensuring that when `MatrixSymbol` objects are encountered during the CSE process, their unique structure and indexing are preserved and handled correctly. Since the detailed implementation of how `MatrixSymbol` objects are specifically handled during CSE isn't directly visible from the provided code, the patch will focus on a conceptual fix that could be applied to the `cse` function in `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/cse_main.py</file>
<original>if isinstance(e, (Matrix, ImmutableMatrix)):
            temp.append(Tuple(*e.flat()))
        elif isinstance(e, (SparseMatrix, ImmutableSparseMatrix)):
            temp.append(Tuple(*e.todok().items()))
        else:
            temp.append(e)</original>
<patched>if isinstance(e, (Matrix, ImmutableMatrix, MatrixSymbol)):
            # For MatrixSymbol, we ensure that the structure is preserved by not flattening.
            if isinstance(e, MatrixSymbol):
                temp.append(e)
            else:
                temp.append(Tuple(*e.flat()))
        elif isinstance(e, (SparseMatrix, ImmutableSparseMatrix)):
            temp.append(Tuple(*e.todok().items()))
        else:
            temp.append(e)</patched>
```

# modification 2

<original># Get the matrices back
    for i, e in enumerate(exprs):
        if isinstance(e, (Matrix, ImmutableMatrix)):
            reduced_exprs[i] = Matrix(e.rows, e.cols, reduced_exprs[i])
            if isinstance(e, ImmutableMatrix):
                reduced_exprs[i] = reduced_exprs[i].as_immutable()
        elif isinstance(e, (SparseMatrix, ImmutableSparseMatrix)):
            m = SparseMatrix(e.rows, e.cols, {})
            for k, v in reduced_exprs[i]:
                m[k] = v
            if isinstance(e, ImmutableSparseMatrix):
                m = m.as_immutable()
            reduced_exprs[i] = m</original>
<patched># Get the matrices back, ensuring MatrixSymbol objects are correctly handled
    for i, e in enumerate(exprs):
        if isinstance(e, (Matrix, ImmutableMatrix, MatrixSymbol)):
            # Directly handling MatrixSymbol to preserve its structure without conversion
            if not isinstance(e, MatrixSymbol):
                reduced_exprs[i] = Matrix(e.rows, e.cols, reduced_exprs[i])
                if isinstance(e, ImmutableMatrix):
                    reduced_exprs[i] = reduced_exprs[i].as_immutable()
        elif isinstance(e, (SparseMatrix, ImmutableSparseMatrix)):

            reduced_exprs[i] = m</patched>
```

These modifications aim to ensure that `MatrixSymbol` objects are treated distinctly from regular matrices during the CSE process, preserving their unique structure and indexing capabilities. The first modification prevents `MatrixSymbol` objects from being flattened, which could disrupt their indexing. The second modification ensures that when reconstructing expressions post-CSE, `MatrixSymbol` objects are not inadvertently converted into a different matrix type that might not support the same indexing semantics.
