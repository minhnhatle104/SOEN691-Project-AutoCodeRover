Specifically, we should look into the `cse()` function, the `MatrixSymbol` class, and possibly how matrix operations are handled in the codebase. Here are the API calls that would be helpful:\n\n1. `search_method(\"cse\")`: This will help us understand how the `cse()` function is implemented and how it handles expressions, especially those involving `MatrixSymbol`.\n\n2. `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`: By looking into the `MatrixSymbol` class, we can gain insights into how matrix symbols are represented and possibly identify why indexing them leads to the observed strange behavior.\n\n3. `search_code(\"Matrix(4, 4, lambda i, j: sp.symbols('%s_%d_%d' % (name, i, j)))\")`: This code snippet is used to construct matrices of symbols. Understanding where and how it's used in the codebase might provide clues on handling matrices and their symbols correctly.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"subs\", \"MatrixSymbol\")`: Since the issue involves substituting symbols within a `MatrixSymbol`, understanding how the `subs` method is implemented for `MatrixSymbol` objects could be crucial.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how symbolic matrices and common subexpression elimination (CSE) are handled in the project, which is essential for diagnosing and fixing the reported issue."
