Given the context and the nature of the issue with the `Mod` function not always returning `0` for non-integer bases, and without direct access to the specific implementation details or file paths in the SymPy library from the provided information, I'll conceptualize a generic patch that addresses the core of the issue based on standard practices in handling modular arithmetic in Python. This conceptual patch assumes that the issue lies in the handling of non-integer inputs for the `Mod` function, which should ideally check the type of the base and handle non-integer and integer bases differently.

Please note, the actual implementation might differ based on the specific architecture and design patterns of the SymPy library. This patch is meant to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the described issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/mod.py</file>  # Hypothetical file path
<original>
if (p == q or p == -q or
    p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q or
    p.is_integer and q == 1):
    return S.Zero
</original>
<patched>
# Added check for non-integer bases using the is_Float attribute
if (p == q or p == -q or
    p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and (p.base == q or p.base.is_Float) or
    p.is_integer and q == 1):
    return S.Zero if not p.base.is_Float else p % q
</patched>
```

This modification assumes the existence of a `is_Float` attribute to check if the base is a floating-point number, which is a common pattern in symbolic mathematics libraries for type checking. The patched code adds a condition to handle cases where the base is a non-integer (float), performing the modulo operation directly in such cases instead of automatically returning `S.Zero`. This approach retains the original logic for integer bases while providing a specific handling mechanism for non-integer bases to address the issue.

Keep in mind, the actual file path (`sympy/core/mod.py`) and the existence of `is_Float` attribute are hypothetical and used here for illustrative purposes. The actual implementation in SymPy may require locating the correct module and method that implements the `Mod` function and adapting the patch according to the library's architecture and existing type-checking mechanisms.
