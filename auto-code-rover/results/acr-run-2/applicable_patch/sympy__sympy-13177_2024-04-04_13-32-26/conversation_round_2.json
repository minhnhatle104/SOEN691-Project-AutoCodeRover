The issue description provides a snippet of code that suggests where the problem might lie:\n\n```python\nif (p == q or p == -q or\np.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q or\np.is_integer and q == 1):\nreturn S.Zero\n```\n\nThis snippet indicates a conditional check within some evaluation logic, likely part of a larger method or function that handles modular arithmetic, possibly within a class that deals with mathematical expressions or symbols.\n\nGiven this, the next steps should involve:\n\n1. Searching for the code snippet provided in the issue to locate the exact place in the codebase where the faulty logic resides. This could help identify the method or function that contains this logic.\n2. Since the issue mentions `Mod`'s evaluation logic and involves operations on powers and integers, it might be beneficial to search for classes that deal with mathematical expressions or symbols, such as a class that might represent symbolic mathematics operations.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be appropriate:\n\n- `search_code(\"if (p == q or p == -q or\\np.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q or\\np.is_integer and q == 1):\")`: This will help locate the exact place in the codebase where the faulty logic is implemented.\n- `search_class(\"Symbol\")`: Assuming that `Mod` operates on symbolic expressions, searching for a class named `Symbol` or similar could provide context on how symbolic operations are handled in the project.\n\nLet's proceed with the first search API call to pinpoint the location of the issue:\n\n`search_code(\"if (p == q or p == -q or\\np.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q or\\np.is_integer and q == 1):\")`"

The search results suggest that either the codebase has evolved and the snippet is outdated, or the search query might not perfectly match the code due to formatting or minor variations.\n\nThe issue revolves around the `Mod` functionality, specifically its evaluation logic when dealing with non-integer bases. The problem described is that `Mod(x**2, x)` does not always return `0` as expected, particularly when `x` is a non-integer. This indicates a flaw in the logic that determines when to return `0`, suggesting that the condition does not account for non-integer bases properly.\n\nGiven the lack of direct search results, we need to adjust our approach to gather more context or locate the relevant part of the codebase. Here are a few alternative strategies:\n\n1. **Broaden the Search for Related Classes or Methods**: Since direct searches for `Mod` and the specific code snippet did not yield results, it might be helpful to search for classes or methods that are likely to be involved in mathematical operations, such as those handling expressions, symbols, or modular arithmetic in a broader sense.\n\n2. **Search for Related Terms or Concepts**: Instead of searching for the exact code snippet, we could search for key terms or concepts mentioned in the issue, such as \"is_Pow\", \"is_Integer\", or \"is_integer\", which might lead us to the relevant parts of the code dealing with power expressions and integer checks.\n\n3. **Review Documentation or Developer Guides**: If available, reviewing project documentation or developer guides might provide insights into how mathematical operations are structured within the codebase, potentially guiding us to the relevant modules or classes.\n\nAt this point, without more specific search results, we do not have enough information to pinpoint the bug locations directly. We need to either broaden our search within the project to find related code or consider alternative sources of information (like documentation) to understand how the project handles modular arithmetic and symbolic expressions."
