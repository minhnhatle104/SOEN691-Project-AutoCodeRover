            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `Indexed` object is handled within the MathML printer and why it's causing a `TypeError` when being iterated over. The error message indicates that the issue arises from treating an `Indexed` object as iterable within the MathML printing process. Specifically, the error occurs in the `_print_Basic` method of a class responsible for MathML printing, as it attempts to iterate over an `Indexed` object.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls will help us gather more context and potentially identify the source of the bug:\n\n1. Search for the `Indexed` class to understand its structure and why it might not be iterable:\n   - `search_class(\"Indexed\")`\n\n2. Search for the `MathMLPrinter` class or any relevant class that handles MathML printing to inspect its methods and how it deals with different types of expressions:\n   - `search_class(\"MathMLPrinter\")`\n\n3. Since the error occurs in the `_print_Basic` method, it's crucial to understand how this method is implemented within the context of MathML printing:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Basic\", \"MathMLPrinter\")`\n\n4. It might also be helpful to understand how the `mathml` function is implemented, as it's the entry point for converting expressions to MathML:\n   - `search_method(\"mathml\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how `Indexed` objects are supposed to be handled during the MathML printing process and where the implementation might be going wrong."
