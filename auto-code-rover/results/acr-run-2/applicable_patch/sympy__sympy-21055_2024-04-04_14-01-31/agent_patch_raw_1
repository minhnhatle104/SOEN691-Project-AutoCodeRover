**Explanation**:

- **Modification 1**: This patch addresses the limitation mentioned in the `TODO` comment regarding the handling of `Integral` and `Polynomial` expressions. By checking if the expression is an instance of `Integral` or `Piecewise` (Polynomial handling could be similar but is not explicitly mentioned in the user's issue), the patch ensures that these expressions are refined by attempting to refine their arguments under the given assumptions. This approach could help in cases where the integral or piecewise expression simplifies under certain assumptions.

- **Modification 2**: This patch adds special handling for the `arg` function when the assumption is that the argument of `arg` is positive. In such cases, the argument of a positive real number is 0. This is a simplistic approach and might need further refinement to handle more complex cases or additional assumptions. However, it addresses the specific issue raised by the user regarding `refine(arg(a), Q.positive(a))` not simplifying as expected.

These modifications aim to enhance the `refine` function's ability to simplify expressions under certain assumptions, particularly for integrals, piecewise functions, and the `arg` function. Further testing and refinement may be necessary to ensure these patches do not introduce regressions or unintended behavior in other use cases.
