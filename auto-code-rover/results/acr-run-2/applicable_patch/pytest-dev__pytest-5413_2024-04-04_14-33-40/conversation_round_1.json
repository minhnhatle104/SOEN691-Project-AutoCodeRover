Specifically, we're interested in how the context variable (the `e` in `with pytest.raises(LookupError) as e:`) is structured and why calling `str(e)` does not return the full exception message as expected, but `str(e.value)` does.\n\nGiven this, we should look into the implementation of `pytest.raises` and any related exception handling mechanisms within pytest. Here are the API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `raises` method in pytest**: This will help us understand how the `raises` context manager is implemented and how it captures exceptions.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(method_name=\"raises\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the class that represents the context variable in `with pytest.raises`**: Since the issue mentions that `str(e)` behaves differently than expected, we need to find the class definition that `e` is an instance of when using `pytest.raises`. This requires knowing the class name, which we might infer from the implementation of `raises`.\n\n   Assuming the context variable might be of a custom class defined in pytest for handling exceptions, we first need to find out what class that is from the implementation of `raises`. If the class name is found (let's hypothetically call it `ExceptionContext` for the purpose of this example), we would then search for that class:\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(class_name=\"ExceptionContext\")  # Hypothetical class name\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for how the exception message is handled or stored within the context variable**: This might involve looking into methods that are responsible for setting or retrieving the exception message within the hypothetical `ExceptionContext` class or related mechanisms.\n\n   Assuming there's a method like `__str__` or any method that handles the conversion to string, we would search within the identified class:\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(method_name=\"__str__\", class_name=\"ExceptionContext\")  # Hypothetical method and class name\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to gather enough context about the implementation details of `pytest.raises` and its handling of exceptions, which will be crucial for proposing a patch to make `str(e)` behave as expected without needing to explicitly access `e.value`."

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the `raises` method in `pytest`, we can deduce the following key points relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Context Manager Usage**: The `raises` function in pytest is designed to be used as a context manager that asserts a block of code raises a specific exception. When used in this manner, it captures the exception and provides an `ExceptionInfo` object for further inspection.\n\n2. **ExceptionInfo Object**: The context manager produces an `ExceptionInfo` object, which can be used to inspect the details of the captured exception. This object is crucial for understanding why `str(e)` behaves differently than expected. The documentation snippet provided suggests using `exc_info.type` to check the exception type and `exc_info.value.args[0]` to access the exception message. This aligns with the issue description, where `str(e.value)` is needed to get the full error message.\n\n3. **No Direct Reference to `ExceptionContext`**: The search did not find a class named `ExceptionContext`, which was a hypothetical name used for the purpose of the search. However, the `ExceptionInfo` object mentioned in the `raises` documentation is likely what was being referred to in the issue. This object is what the variable `e` in the `with pytest.raises(LookupError) as e:` statement refers to.\n\n4. **Behavior of `str(e)` vs. `str(e.value)`**: The issue stems from the expectation that `str(e)` should directly return the full exception message, similar to how it would in a standard Python `try-except` block. However, in the context of `pytest.raises`, `e` is an `ExceptionInfo` object, and `str(e)` does not automatically delegate to `str(e.value)`. This is why `str(e.value)` is required to access the full exception message.\n\nGiven this context, the core of the issue lies in the design of the `ExceptionInfo` object and how it represents or exposes the underlying exception message when converted to a string. To address the issue, one would need to consider modifying how `ExceptionInfo`'s string representation (`__str__` method) is implemented, ensuring it aligns more closely with the user's expectations (i.e., directly showing the full exception message).\n\nHowever, without direct access to the `ExceptionInfo` class definition or its methods from the search results, we can infer that any patch or solution would involve adjusting how `ExceptionInfo` formats its string representation to include the full message of the contained exception (`e.value`). This might involve modifying the `__str__` method of the `ExceptionInfo` class, if such a method exists, to ensure it returns `str(self.value)` or a similarly comprehensive representation of the exception message."
