**Explanation:**
This patch introduces a helper function `make_pickleable` within the `_combine` method to convert non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys` to a pickleable format (in this case, a list) before performing a deep copy. This approach ensures that when `copy.deepcopy` is called on a `Q` object containing `dict_keys`, it will not raise a `TypeError` due to the inability to pickle `dict_keys` objects. The conversion is applied to the `children` attribute of `Q` objects, which is where conditions are stored. This solution maintains the original logic and behavior of the `_combine` method while addressing the issue with non-pickleable objects.
