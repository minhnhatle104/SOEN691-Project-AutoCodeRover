Given the context and the issue described, the problem lies in the handling of the `method` variable, where binary strings are not correctly converted to string types in Python 3, leading to incorrect method names like `"b'GET'"`. To resolve this, we need to ensure that binary strings are decoded to UTF-8 strings before any further processing. This approach assumes that the HTTP methods will be ASCII, which is a safe assumption given the HTTP specification.

Here's a proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>        method = builtin_str(method)</original>
<patched>        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('utf-8')
        else:
            method = str(method)</patched>
```

This modification checks if the `method` variable is an instance of `bytes` (binary string in Python 3) and decodes it to a UTF-8 string. If it's not a binary string, it converts it to a string using `str()`, which should be equivalent to the original `builtin_str(method)` intention but handles binary strings correctly. This change should resolve the issue without affecting the functionality for non-binary string inputs.
