This modification addresses the issue by adding a check for special characters (`{`, `}`) in the symbol names within the `lambdify` function. If such characters are found, it creates a dummy symbol with a sanitized name (prefixing with `dummy_for_`) and updates the namespace with this dummy symbol instead of the original. This approach ensures that symbols with names that are not valid Python identifiers, including those with special characters, are handled correctly by `lambdify`, even when they are `MatrixSymbol` objects.
