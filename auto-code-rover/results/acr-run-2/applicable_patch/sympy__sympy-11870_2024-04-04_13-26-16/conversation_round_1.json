        "content": "Analyzing the issue and the context gathered from the search results, the user is asking for a way to simplify expressions involving exponential functions into trigonometric identities using the `trigsimp` function. Specifically, they are looking for:\n\n1. Simplification of `1 / 2 * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` into `sin(k)`.\n2. Simplification of `1 / 2 / k* (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` into `sinc(k)`.\n\nFrom the search results, we have found three relevant pieces of information:\n\n1. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py**: This file contains the main implementation of the `trigsimp` function. It describes various methods for trigonometric simplification, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. The function attempts to reduce expressions by using known trig identities and is capable of handling expressions recursively.\n\n2. **sympy/core/expr.py**: This file shows that the `trigsimp` method is also available as a method of the `Expr` class, which means it can be directly called on any SymPy expression object.\n\n3. **sympy/vector/basisdependent.py**: This file indicates that the `trigsimp` function is also implemented for quantities that are basis-dependent, suggesting that the simplification capabilities of `trigsimp` are integrated across different parts of the SymPy library.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to be related to the `trigsimp` function's ability to recognize and simplify expressions involving exponentials into their trigonometric forms. The current implementation, as described in the `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` file, does not explicitly mention handling of exponential expressions to trigonometric identities, such as converting `exp(I*k)` and `exp(-I*k)` into `sin(k)` or `sinc(k)`.\n\nTo address the issue, potential patches could involve:\n\n1. Enhancing the `trigsimp` function to recognize and simplify expressions involving `exp(I*x)` and `exp(-I*x)` into their corresponding trigonometric forms. This might involve adding new patterns to the 'matching' method or enhancing the 'fu' method with additional trigonometric transformations.\n\n2. Introducing a special case handling for the `sinc` function, which is not a basic trigonometric function but is closely related to the sine function and frequently appears in signal processing and Fourier analysis.\n\nThe next steps would involve diving deeper into the implementation details of the `trigsimp` function, particularly the pattern matching and transformation rules, to devise a way to incorporate these enhancements."
