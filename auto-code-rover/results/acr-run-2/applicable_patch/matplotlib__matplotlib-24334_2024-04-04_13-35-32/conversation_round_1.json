        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified three relevant methods named `set_ticks` across different classes in the Matplotlib library. Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Colorbar Class (`lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py`)**:\n   - The `set_ticks` method in the `Colorbar` class allows setting tick locations and optionally labels. It accepts a list of floats for `ticks`, an optional list of strings for `labels`, a boolean for `minor`, and additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) for `.Text` properties that take effect only if labels are passed.\n\n2. **Axis Class (`lib/matplotlib/axis.py`)**:\n   - The `set_ticks` method in the `Axis` class is used to set tick locations and optionally labels on an axis. It takes similar parameters to the `Colorbar` class method, including a list of floats for `ticks`, an optional list of strings for `labels`, a boolean for `minor`, and `**kwargs` for `.Text` properties effective only with labels. This method also ensures that the view limits of the Axis are expanded to make all ticks visible if necessary.\n\n3. **SecondaryAxis Class (`lib/matplotlib/axes/_secondary_axes.py`)**:\n   - The `set_ticks` method in the `SecondaryAxis` class essentially delegates the task to the `_axis` attribute's `set_ticks` method, passing along all arguments including `ticks`, `labels`, `minor`, and `**kwargs`.\n\nThe issue reported is related to the behavior of these `set_ticks` methods, specifically regarding the handling of `**kwargs` when `labels` are not set. The current implementation only applies `.Text` properties (passed as `**kwargs`) if labels are provided. However, the issue suggests that `**kwargs` should be validated as valid `.Text` properties in all cases, and possibly raising an error if `labels` are not set when `**kwargs` are provided.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to consider modifying the implementation of `set_ticks` methods in the relevant classes to include validation of `**kwargs` as `.Text` properties, regardless of whether `labels` are provided. Additionally, we may need to consider raising an error if `**kwargs` are provided without `labels`, to align with the proposed solution in the issue description.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch for the `set_ticks` method, particularly in the `Axis` class, as it seems to be the most central implementation affecting other components. This would likely involve adjusting the logic around the handling and validation of `**kwargs` within the method."
