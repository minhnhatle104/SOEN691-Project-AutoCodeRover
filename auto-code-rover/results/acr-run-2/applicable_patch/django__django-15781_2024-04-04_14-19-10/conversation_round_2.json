        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some valuable information to start analyzing the issue regarding the formatting of the help text in a Django management command.\n\n1. **BaseCommand Class**:\n   - The `BaseCommand` class in `django/core/management/base.py` is the foundation for creating management commands in Django. It provides a structure and a set of functionalities that can be extended or overridden by subclasses to implement custom commands.\n   - The class contains several methods and properties, but notably, there is a `help` property that is initialized as an empty string. This property is likely intended to be overridden by subclasses to provide a help text for the command.\n   - The `add_arguments` method allows subclassed commands to add custom arguments. This method is meant to be overridden but doesn't directly relate to the formatting issue.\n   - The `print_help` method is present, which is likely responsible for printing the help text when a user requests help on a specific command. This method could be a key area where the formatting of the help text is handled or could be affected.\n\n2. **add_arguments Method**:\n   - The `add_arguments` method in the `BaseCommand` class is designed to be an entry point for subclassed commands to add custom arguments. This method by itself does not directly relate to the issue of help text formatting but is crucial for understanding how commands are structured and how arguments are defined.\n\n3. **Help Method**:\n   - The search for a `help` method within the `BaseCommand` class did not yield any results. This indicates that there isn't a specific method named `help` for handling the help text. Instead, the help text's formatting and display logic might be embedded within other methods, such as `print_help` or through the `help` property that subclasses are expected to override.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around how the help text, particularly multiline or formatted text like example usage, is being handled and displayed by the `BaseCommand` class, possibly within the `print_help` method or through how the `help` property is processed.\n\nTo further investigate, we should look into how the `print_help` method works and how the `help` property is used when generating the help text. Additionally, understanding how Django's management command framework processes and displays help text in general could provide insights into where the formatting issue originates and how it can be addressed."

        "content": "With the additional context provided by the search result for the `print_help` method in the `BaseCommand` class, we can now analyze how the help text is generated and identify potential areas where the formatting issue might occur.\n\n### Analysis of the `print_help` Method\n\n- The `print_help` method is responsible for printing the help message for a command. It does this by first creating a parser object with `self.create_parser(prog_name, subcommand)` and then calling `parser.print_help()`.\n- The method's implementation suggests that the actual formatting and printing of the help text are delegated to the parser object. This means the `print_help` method itself might not be directly responsible for the formatting issue, but rather, how the parser object handles the help text could be the source of the problem.\n- The help text, including the example usage, is likely specified in the `help` property of the command class that subclasses `BaseCommand`. However, the way this text is processed and passed to the parser object could affect its formatting when displayed.\n\n### Potential Bug Locations\n\nBased on this analysis, the bug could be located in one of the following areas:\n\n1. **How the `help` property is processed and passed to the parser**: If the `help` property's content is not correctly processed or passed to the parser in a way that preserves its formatting, this could lead to the observed issue. However, from the information we have, it's not clear where this processing occurs.\n\n2. **The parser object's handling of help text**: Since the `print_help` method delegates the actual printing to the parser object, the way the parser handles and displays multiline or formatted text could be where the formatting issue arises.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to look into how the `help` property's content is formatted and passed to the parser object and how the parser object itself handles and displays help text. Unfortunately, the current context does not provide detailed insights into these specific mechanisms, suggesting that the bug is not directly within the `print_help` method but possibly in the mechanisms that feed into it.\n\nGiven the analysis, we do not have a direct patch to apply without further investigation into the parser object's implementation and how help text is processed before being passed to it. This would likely involve looking into the `create_parser` method and the parser's implementation to understand how it handles multiline and formatted text."
