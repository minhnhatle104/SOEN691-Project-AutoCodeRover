Given the context and the issue with the help text formatting, it seems the problem might not be directly with the methods themselves but how they interact with the formatting of multiline help text. Since the methods `add_usage`, `add_arguments`, and `_reordered_actions` in the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class do not directly manipulate the text but rather the order of actions, the issue might stem from how the `description` (which is derived from the `help` property in `BaseCommand`) is handled by the `ArgumentParser` and subsequently by the `DjangoHelpFormatter`.

However, without a clear bug in the provided method implementations and without further context indicating a misbehavior in these methods, a direct patch to these methods might not resolve the issue. The issue described seems more related to preserving multiline or formatted text in the `help` property when displayed.

A potential approach to ensure better handling of multiline help text could involve ensuring that the `help` text's formatting is preserved when passed to the `ArgumentParser`. This might not be a direct patch but rather a suggestion to ensure that when setting the `help` property in custom management commands, developers are mindful of how text formatting is preserved.

Since a direct modification to the provided methods might not address the issue without changing the fundamental behavior of the `ArgumentParser` or the `DjangoHelpFormatter`, and without specific details on the formatting issue, I'll provide a hypothetical patch that could be applied if the issue were related to ensuring multiline text in `help` is correctly formatted. This is more of a conceptual patch rather than a direct fix based on the provided code snippets.

# Hypothetical modification to ensure multiline help text is preserved
```python
<file>django/core/management/base.py</file>
<original>description=self.help or None,</original>
<patched>description=self.help.replace('\\n', '\n') if self.help else None,</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the issue might be related to newline characters (`\n`) not being correctly interpreted in the `help` text. By replacing escaped newline characters (`\\n`) with actual newline characters (`\n`), this patch aims to ensure that multiline help text is correctly displayed. However, this is a speculative solution and might not directly address the issue without further context on how the `help` text is being formatted and passed to the `ArgumentParser`.

For a precise solution, a deeper investigation into how the `help` text is formatted, how the `ArgumentParser` and `DjangoHelpFormatter` handle this text, and how the command-line interface displays it would be necessary.
