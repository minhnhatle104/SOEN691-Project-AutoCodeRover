Here are the API calls that would help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AutocompleteJsonView\")`: This will help us find the file or files where the `AutocompleteJsonView` class is defined, giving us a starting point for understanding how it's currently implemented.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"AutocompleteJsonView\")`: With this, we can locate the `get` method within the `AutocompleteJsonView` class to understand its current implementation, especially how it constructs the response.\n\n3. `search_code(\"JsonResponse({\")`: Since the issue description mentions the use of `JsonResponse` for constructing the autocomplete response, this search will help us find instances where `JsonResponse` is used, potentially leading us to the exact spot in the `get` method where the response is constructed.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the current implementation and how we might introduce the suggested changes."
