            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `SeqFormula` class and its rendering in Jupyter notebooks work, particularly how it handles the conversion to a string format that includes LaTeX for rendering sequences. The issue points to a problem with the escaping of square brackets in the LaTeX string, which affects the display in Jupyter markdown cells. Let's start by gathering more context about the `SeqFormula` class and any relevant rendering methods it might use.\n\n1. **Search for the `SeqFormula` class**: This will help us understand the structure of the class and any relevant methods that might be involved in generating the LaTeX or string representation of sequences.\n\n2. **Search for methods in the `SeqFormula` class**: Since the issue involves rendering, we are particularly interested in methods that might be responsible for generating LaTeX or string representations. Methods like `__str__`, `_latex`, or similar could be relevant.\n\n3. **Search for code related to rendering sequences**: It's possible that the rendering logic might not be contained solely within the `SeqFormula` class. There could be utility functions or methods in other classes that handle the conversion to LaTeX or string formats for sequences.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following API calls will be made:\n\n- `search_class(\"SeqFormula\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"SeqFormula\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_latex\", \"SeqFormula\")`\n- `search_code(\"SeqFormula\")`"
