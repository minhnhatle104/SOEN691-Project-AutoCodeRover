This patch corrects the issue with the improper escaping of square brackets in the LaTeX output of `SeqFormula` objects. By removing the raw string notation (`r"..."`) around the LaTeX commands for left and right square brackets, the output no longer includes unnecessary backslashes that were causing rendering issues in Jupyter markdown cells. This change ensures that the square brackets are treated as normal characters in the string, which should render correctly in LaTeX environments, including Jupyter notebooks.
