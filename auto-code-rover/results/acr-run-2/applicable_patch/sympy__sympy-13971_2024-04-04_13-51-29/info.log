The issue points to a problem with the escaping of square brackets in the LaTeX string, which affects the display in Jupyter markdown cells. Let\'s start by gathering more context about the `SeqFormula` class and any relevant rendering methods it might use.\n\n1. **Search for the `SeqFormula` class**: This will help us understand the structure of the class and any relevant methods that might be involved in generating the LaTeX or string representation of sequences.\n\n2. **Search for methods in the `SeqFormula` class**: Since the issue involves rendering, we are particularly interested in methods that might be responsible for generating LaTeX or string representations.

Here's a summary of the findings and their implications for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Location and Structure of `SeqFormula`**:\n   - The `SeqFormula` class is defined in `sympy/series/sequences.py`.\n   - It inherits from `SeqExpr` and includes methods like `__new__`, `formula`, `_eval_coeff`, `_add`, `_mul`, and `coeff_mul`. Notably, there are no direct `__str__` or `_latex` methods within the class, which suggests that the string or LaTeX representation is handled elsewhere.\n\n2. **Absence of Direct Rendering Methods**:\n   - The absence of `__str__` and `_latex` methods in the `SeqFormula` class indicates that the rendering to string or LaTeX formats is likely handled by a more generic mechanism, possibly in the printing or rendering subsystem of SymPy.\n\n3. **Potential Locations for Rendering Logic**:\n   - The search for `SeqFormula` across the codebase revealed references in various files, including tests and other series-related files. However, the most promising leads for addressing the rendering issue are in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and possibly in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. These files are part of SymPy's printing system, which is responsible for converting SymPy objects into human-readable formats, including LaTeX.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps should involve investigating how `SeqFormula` objects are converted to LaTeX in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. Since the issue specifically involves the rendering of sequences in LaTeX format and the improper escaping of square brackets, the logic within `sympy/printing/latex.py` that handles `SeqFormula` objects or sequences in general will be crucial.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n- Examine the relevant parts of `sympy/printing/latex.py` to understand how `SeqFormula` objects are being converted to LaTeX strings.\n- Look for any logic that explicitly adds backslashes to square brackets or otherwise manipulates brackets in a way that could lead to the described issue.\n\nThis approach will help us identify the source of the problem and formulate a patch to ensure that sequences are rendered correctly in Jupyter notebooks without improper escaping of square brackets.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Here's an analysis based on the new information:\n\n1. **Identified Method for Rendering `SeqFormula`**:\n   - The method `_print_SeqFormula` in `sympy/printing/latex.py` is explicitly designed to handle the conversion of `SeqFormula` objects to LaTeX strings. This method is the most likely location for the logic that leads to the improper escaping of square brackets in the rendered output.\n\n2. **Occurrences Outside Functions**:\n   - There are also three matches found outside any function in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. These could be related to configuration or registration code that associates `SeqFormula` objects with the `_print_SeqFormula` method or sets up general printing behavior for sequences.\n\nGiven this context, the `_print_SeqFormula` method is the primary candidate for containing the bug described in the issue. The issue likely stems from how this method formats the sequence into a LaTeX string, possibly adding unnecessary backslashes to square brackets which are then incorrectly rendered in Jupyter markdown cells.\n\nTo address the issue, the next steps would involve:\n- Reviewing the implementation of `_print_SeqFormula` to understand how it converts `SeqFormula` objects into LaTeX strings, paying particular attention to any code that handles square brackets.\n- Examining the three occurrences outside functions for any configuration that might affect how sequences are rendered in LaTeX, although the primary focus should remain on the `_print_SeqFormula` method.\n\nThis analysis points towards a focused area in the codebase where a patch could be applied to correct the rendering of `SeqFormula` objects, ensuring that square brackets are not improperly escaped in the LaTeX output.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

             '1. **Location and Structure of `SeqFormula`**:\n'
             '   - The `SeqFormula` class is defined in `sympy/series/sequences.py`.\n'

             'However, the most promising leads for addressing the rendering issue are in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and possibly in '
