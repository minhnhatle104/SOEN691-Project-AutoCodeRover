This patch introduces handling for multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field within the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class. It checks if the operation is an `AlterField` and affects the same field. If so, it combines the attributes of the current field and the operation's field into a new `AlterField` operation, effectively reducing multiple alterations into a single operation. This should address the inefficiency in migration optimization when dealing with multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field.
