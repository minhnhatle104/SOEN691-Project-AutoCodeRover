This patch introduces a check to ensure that `n_neighbors` is an integer. If `n_neighbors` is a float but represents an integer value (e.g., 3.0), it is cast to an integer. Otherwise, if `n_neighbors` is neither an integer nor a float representing an integer, a `ValueError` is raised. This approach addresses the issue by providing clear feedback when invalid types are passed for `n_neighbors` and allows for leniency when the value is a float that can be safely interpreted as an integer.
