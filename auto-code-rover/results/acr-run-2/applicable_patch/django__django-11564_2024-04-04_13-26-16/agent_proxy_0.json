Given the information from the issue, we should look into the implementation of the static tag, and the two mentioned storage classes. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"def render(self, context):\")` - This will help us find the implementation of the `render` method which seems to be a part of the static tag's logic, as mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. `search_class(\"FileSystemStorage\")` - Since the issue mentions that `FileSystemStorage` ignores `SCRIPT_NAME`, we need to look into this class to understand how it handles URLs.\n\n3. `search_class(\"StaticFilesStorage\")` - Similar to `FileSystemStorage`, we need to understand how `StaticFilesStorage` handles URLs, especially in relation to `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\nThese searches will provide a good starting point for understanding the current implementation and how it might be modified to address the issue."
