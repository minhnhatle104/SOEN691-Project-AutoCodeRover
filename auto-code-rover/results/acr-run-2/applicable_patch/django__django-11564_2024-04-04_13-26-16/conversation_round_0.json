When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.\nThis problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.\nThis can be easily added into default Django static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:\ndef render(self, context):\nurl = self.url(context)\n# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME']\nif self.varname is None:\nreturn url\ncontext[self.varname] = url\nreturn ''\nOn more research I found that FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage ignores SCRIPT_NAME as well.\nWe might have to do a lot of changes but I think it's worth the efforts.\n</issue>"
