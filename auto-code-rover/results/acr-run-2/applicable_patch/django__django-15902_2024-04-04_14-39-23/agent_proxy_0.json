Based on the description of the issue, it seems relevant to look into the implementation of the management form and any associated deprecation warnings. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ManagementForm\")`: This will help understand how the ManagementForm class is implemented and might give insights into where the template deprecation warning is being triggered.\n\n2. `search_code(\"deprecation warning\")`: By searching for instances where a deprecation warning is raised in the codebase, we can potentially find the specific warning related to the \"default.html\" template usage.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue and formulating a patch."
