Given the context and the findings from the search results, let's assume the issue with the "default.html" deprecation warning is due to its usage in form rendering processes, particularly within `django/forms/renderers.py` and potentially affecting utilities in `django/forms/utils.py`. While I don't have access to the exact lines of code or the structure of these files, a hypothetical patch could look something like this:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/renderers.py</file>
<original>
def render(self, template_name, context, request=None):
    template = self.get_template(template_name)
    return template.render(context, request=request).strip()
</original>
<patched>
def render(self, template_name, context, request=None):
    # Check if the deprecated "default.html" template is being used
    if template_name == "default.html":
        # Update to the new recommended template name
        template_name = "new_default_template.html"
    template = self.get_template(template_name)
    return template.render(context, request=request).strip()
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/forms/utils.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming there's a direct reference or function related to "default.html" that needs updating
use_default_template("default.html")
</original>
<patched>
# Update the template name to the new standard
use_default_template("new_default_template.html")
</patched>
```

These modifications are based on the assumption that "default.html" is directly referenced and needs to be replaced with a new template name ("new_default_template.html" in this example) to avoid deprecation warnings. The actual template name and the specific conditions under which the template is used or checked might vary based on the project's requirements and the details of the deprecation.

Please note, the actual implementation might require more nuanced changes, including updating documentation, tests, or other references to "default.html" throughout the Django project. Additionally, it's crucial to verify the new template name and ensure it aligns with the project's standards and the reasons behind the deprecation of "default.html".
