        "content": "Based on the collected context, the issue arises from the `mathematica_code` function located in the file `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`. This function is designed to convert a SymPy expression into a string of Wolfram Mathematica code. The issue reported is specifically with the handling of the `Max` function. The expected behavior is for the `mathematica_code` function to output Mathematica-compatible syntax for the `Max` function, which should be `Max[x,2]`. However, the reported output is `Max(2, x)`, which is not valid Mathematica syntax.\n\nThe `mathematica_code` function itself delegates the actual printing to `MCodePrinter(settings).doprint(expr)`. This suggests that the handling of the `Max` function, and potentially other similar functions, is determined by the implementation of the `MCodePrinter` class and its `doprint` method or any method it uses to handle specific expressions like `Max`.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to investigate how `MCodePrinter` handles the `Max` function and similar expressions. This will likely involve looking into the `MCodePrinter` class to understand its implementation and how it decides to format different types of expressions into Mathematica code.\n\nNext steps should include:\n1. Investigating the `MCodePrinter` class, particularly how it processes expressions like `Max`.\n2. Identifying where the incorrect formatting for Mathematica code is generated.\n3. Implementing a fix to ensure expressions are formatted correctly as valid Mathematica code.\n\nLet's proceed with investigating the `MCodePrinter` class and its relevant methods."
