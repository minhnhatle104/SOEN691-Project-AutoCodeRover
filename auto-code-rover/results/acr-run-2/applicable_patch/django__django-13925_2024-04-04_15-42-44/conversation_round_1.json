        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified two occurrences of the `Entity` class within the codebase, both in test directories (`tests/select_for_update/models.py` and `tests/order_with_respect_to/models.py`). This suggests that the `Entity` class mentioned in the issue might not be directly visible through the search results provided, possibly because it's part of application-specific code rather than Django's core or test suite. The mention of `Entity` in the issue implies it's a significant part of the inheritance structure for the models raising the `models.W042` warning, but without the specific code snippet, it's challenging to directly address the primary key inheritance issue.\n\nRegarding the `User` class, there are multiple occurrences across various test files and the Django auth system (`django/contrib/auth/models.py`). Given the context of the issue, it's likely that the relevant `User` class is part of application-specific code rather than these instances found in Django's tests or the auth system. The issue describes a situation where `User` inherits from `Entity`, which suggests a custom implementation that might not be directly related to these search results.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n\n1. **Direct Inspection of Application Code**: Since the search results primarily point to test files and Django's internal models, direct inspection of the application-specific models file (where `Entity` and `User` are defined) would be necessary. This would require access to the application's codebase, which is not available through the provided interface.\n\n2. **Reviewing Inheritance and Primary Key Definition**: The issue at hand involves inheritance and the definition of primary keys. It would be beneficial to review how Django's model inheritance works, especially regarding primary keys. In Django, if a model inherits from another model, it doesn't automatically inherit the parent model's primary key unless explicitly stated. This might be causing the `models.W042` warnings if Django 3.2 alpha has changes affecting this behavior.\n\n3. **Consulting Django Documentation and Release Notes**: Since the issue arose after upgrading to Django 3.2 alpha, reviewing the release notes for Django 3.2 could provide insights into changes in model inheritance or primary key handling that might be causing these warnings.\n\nWithout direct access to the application code or further details on how `Entity` and `User` are implemented, it's challenging to provide a specific patch. However, the general approach would involve ensuring that primary keys are correctly defined and inherited in custom models and reviewing any Django 3.2 alpha changes that might affect this behavior."
