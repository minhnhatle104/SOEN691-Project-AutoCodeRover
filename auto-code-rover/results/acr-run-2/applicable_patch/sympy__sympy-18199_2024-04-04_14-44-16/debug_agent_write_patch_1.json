        "content": "Based on the information provided from the search results, the `nthroot_mod` function is designed to find solutions to the equation \\(x^n = a \\mod p\\). The function is located in the file `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py` within the SymPy library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.\n\nThe parameters of the function are:\n- `a`: an integer, which is the right-hand side of the equation \\(x^n = a\\).\n- `n`: a positive integer, which is the exponent in the equation.\n- `p`: a positive integer, which is the modulus of the equation.\n- `all_roots`: a boolean value that, if False, returns the smallest root; if True, returns a list of all roots.\n\nThe function starts by converting `a`, `n`, and `p` to integers. It has a special case for when `n` is 2, directly calling `sqrt_mod` to find the square root modulo `p`. It checks if `a` is an `n`th power residue modulo `p` and raises a `NotImplementedError` if `p` is not prime.\n\nThe core of the function involves calculating the roots of \\(x^n - a = 0 \\mod p\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\(x^n - a\\) and \\(x^{(p - 1)} - 1\\) modulo `p`. This is done through a series of mathematical operations that eventually lead to finding the roots.\n\nThe issue reported is that the function misses one root of \\(x = 0 \\mod p\\) when \\(a \\% p == 0\\). This means that when `a` is divisible by `p`, the equation \\(x^n = a \\mod p\\) has a root at \\(x = 0\\), which the current implementation does not account for.\n\nTo address this issue, a patch needs to be introduced to check for the condition \\(a \\% p == 0\\) and include \\(0\\) as a root in such cases. This check should ideally be placed before the function performs more complex calculations, as it is a simple condition that can be checked directly after the initial parameter validation."
