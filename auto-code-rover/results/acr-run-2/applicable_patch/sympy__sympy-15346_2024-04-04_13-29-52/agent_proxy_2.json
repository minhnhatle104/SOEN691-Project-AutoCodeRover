The specific files and methods that could be relevant to the issue are:\n     - `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` in the `simplify` method: This method applies various simplification strategies and could potentially be missing or inadequately handling cases for trigonometric functions with rational arguments.\n     - `sympy/core/expr.py` in the `simplify` method: While this method mainly delegates to the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, understanding its role in the simplification process is crucial.\n     - The implementation of `trigsimp` could also be relevant, as it is specifically mentioned in the `simplify` method as a strategy for trigonometric simplification."
