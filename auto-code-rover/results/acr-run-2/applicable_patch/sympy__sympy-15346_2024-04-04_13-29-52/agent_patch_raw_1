Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem lies in the simplification process not effectively handling trigonometric expressions involving rational numbers. A potential solution could involve enhancing the `trigsimp` function to better recognize and simplify these expressions. However, without a specific bug pinpointed in the provided code snippets or a clear direction on how the simplification process fails for trigonometric expressions with rational numbers, proposing a precise patch is challenging.

Nonetheless, I can suggest a hypothetical patch that aims to improve the handling of trigonometric expressions with rational arguments within the `trigsimp` function. This patch would involve adding a preprocessing step to `trigsimp` to detect and transform trigonometric functions of rational numbers into a form that might be more amenable to simplification.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py</file>
<original>expr = sympify(expr)</original>
<patched>from sympy.core.numbers import Rational
expr = sympify(expr)
# Preprocess trigonometric functions with rational arguments
def preprocess_trig_rationals(expr):
    if expr.func in [sin, cos] and isinstance(expr.args[0], Rational):
        # Example transformation: sin(pi * Rational) -> sin(pi).simplify()
        # This is a placeholder for actual logic to handle rational arguments more effectively
        return expr.func(pi * expr.args[0]).simplify()
    else:
        return expr
expr = preprocess_trig_rationals(expr)</patched>
```

Please note, the patch provided above is hypothetical and serves as an example of how one might begin to address the issue of simplifying trigonometric expressions with rational arguments. The actual implementation would require a deeper understanding of the specific simplification failures and a comprehensive approach to handling various trigonometric and rational expressions within SymPy's simplification framework.
