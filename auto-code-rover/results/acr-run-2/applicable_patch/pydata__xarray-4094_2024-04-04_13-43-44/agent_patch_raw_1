<patched>        import pandas as pd
        if not isinstance(idx, pd.MultiIndex):
            # Handle the case where 'dim' is not a MultiIndex, which can occur with single-dimension variables
            # Convert the Index to a MultiIndex with a single level to maintain consistency
            idx = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([idx], names=[dim])
            self[dim] = idx</patched>
```

Explanation:
- **Modification 1** addresses the issue where unstacking could inadvertently drop dimensions that are single-dimension in the original dataset. By using `.drop_vars(dim, errors='ignore')` instead of `.squeeze(drop=True)`, we ensure that dimensions are preserved unless they are explicitly the dimension being unstacked. This change aims to prevent the `MergeError` by maintaining the integrity of the dataset's dimensions throughout the unstacking process.
  
- **Modification 2** introduces a check and conversion for cases where the `dim` is not a `pd.MultiIndex`, which is a scenario that can occur with datasets containing single-dimension variables. By converting the Index to a MultiIndex with a single level, we ensure that the `to_unstacked_dataset` method can proceed without encountering the ValueError. This modification is necessary to handle the edge case described in the issue, where the unstacking process fails for variables with a single dimension. The inclusion of `import pandas as pd` ensures that `pd.MultiIndex` is available for use in this context.
