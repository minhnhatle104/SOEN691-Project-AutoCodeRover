        # This change assumes _facecolors provides the necessary color information in a compatible format.
        # If _facecolors2d was intended to provide a modified or processed version of face colors,

This patch modifies the `get_facecolor` method in the `Poly3DCollection` class to return `self._facecolors` instead of `self._facecolors2d`, which does not exist. This change is based on the assumption that `_facecolors` exists and is properly managed within both `Poly3DCollection` and its base class, providing the necessary color information for 3D polygons. If `_facecolors2d` was intended to perform additional processing on the face colors, further modifications might be needed to replicate that functionality.
