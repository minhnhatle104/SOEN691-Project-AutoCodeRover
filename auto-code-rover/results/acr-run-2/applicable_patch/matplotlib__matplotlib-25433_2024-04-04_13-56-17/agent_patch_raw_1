Given the nature of the issue described and the insights gathered from the context provided, a hypothetical patch can be proposed to address the problem of widget inputs being blocked after using `clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` in the `on_changed` callback of a range slider. This patch aims to ensure that widget states and event bindings are correctly managed during figure updates.

Please note, the actual implementation details might vary based on the full context of the Matplotlib library's codebase and the specific versions of Python and Matplotlib being used. The following patch is conceptual and should be tested and validated within the development environment.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py</file>
<original>def clf():
    """Clear the current figure."""
    gcf().clear()
</original>
<patched>def clf(keep_observers=True):
    """Clear the current figure but keep observers by default."""
    gcf().clear(keep_observers=keep_observers)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/widgets.py</file>
<original>def onchanged(values):
    print("on changed")
    print(values)
    pyplot.clf()
    addElements()
    pyplot.draw()
</original>
<patched>def onchanged(values):
    print("on changed")
    print(values)
    pyplot.clf(keep_observers=True)  # Keep observers to maintain widget functionality
    addElements()
    pyplot.draw()
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>def clear(self, keep_observers=False):
        """
        Clear the figure.

        Parameters
        ----------
        keep_observers : bool, default: False
            Set *keep_observers* to True if, for example,
            a gui widget is tracking the Axes in the figure.
        """
        self.suppressComposite = None
        ...
        if not keep_observers:
            self._axobservers = cbook.CallbackRegistry()
</original>
<patched>def clear(self, keep_observers=True):
        """
        Clear the figure but modify the default behavior to keep observers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        keep_observers : bool, default: True
            Modified to keep observers by default to ensure widget functionality is preserved.
        """
        self.suppressComposite = None
        ...
        if not keep_observers:
            self._axobservers = cbook.CallbackRegistry()
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by adjusting the default behavior to preserve widget observers when clearing the figure, which is crucial for maintaining widget functionality and event bindings. It's important to thoroughly test these changes in the specific environment where the issue was observed to ensure they resolve the problem without introducing new issues.
