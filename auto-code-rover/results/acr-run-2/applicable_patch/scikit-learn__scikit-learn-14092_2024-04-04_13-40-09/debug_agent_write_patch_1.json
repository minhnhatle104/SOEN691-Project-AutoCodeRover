        "content": "<issue>NCA fails in GridSearch due to too strict parameter checks\nNCA checks its parameters to have a specific type, which can easily fail in a GridSearch due to how param grid is made.\nHere is an example:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nX = np.random.random_sample((100, 10))\ny = np.random.randint(2, size=100)\nnca = NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis()\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\npipe = Pipeline([('nca', nca),\n('knn', knn)])\nparams = {'nca__tol': [0.1, 0.5, 1],\n'nca__n_components': np.arange(1, 10)}\ngs = GridSearchCV(estimator=pipe, param_grid=params, error_score='raise')\ngs.fit(X,y)\n```\nThe issue is that for `tol`: 1 is not a float, and for  `n_components`: np.int64 is not int\nBefore proposing a fix for this specific situation, I'd like to have your general opinion about parameter checking.\nI like this idea of common parameter checking tool introduced with the NCA PR. What do you think about extending it across the code-base (or at least for new or recent estimators) ?\nCurrently parameter checking is not always done or often partially done, and is quite redundant. For instance, here is the input validation of lda:\n```python\ndef _check_params(self):\n\"\"\"Check model parameters.\"\"\"\nif self.n_components <= 0:\nraise ValueError(\"Invalid 'n_components' parameter: %r\"\n% self.n_components)\nif self.total_samples <= 0:\nraise ValueError(\"Invalid 'total_samples' parameter: %r\"\n% self.total_samples)\nif self.learning_offset < 0:\nraise ValueError(\"Invalid 'learning_offset' parameter: %r\"\n% self.learning_offset)\nif self.learning_method not in (\"batch\", \"online\"):\nraise ValueError(\"Invalid 'learning_method' parameter: %r\"\n% self.learning_method)\n```\nmost params aren't checked and for those who are there's a lot of duplicated code.\nA propose to be upgrade the new tool to be able to check open/closed intervals (currently only closed) and list membership.\nThe api would be something like that:\n```\ncheck_param(param, name, valid_options)\n```\nwhere valid_options would be a dict of `type: constraint`. e.g for the `beta_loss` param of `NMF`, it can be either a float or a string in a list, which would give\n```\nvalid_options = {numbers.Real: None,  # None for no constraint\nstr: ['frobenius', 'kullback-leibler', 'itakura-saito']}\n```\nSometimes a parameter can only be positive or within a given interval, e.g. `l1_ratio` of `LogisticRegression` must be between 0 and 1, which would give\n```\nvalid_options = {numbers.Real: Interval(0, 1, closed='both')}\n```\npositivity of e.g. `max_iter` would be `numbers.Integral: Interval(left=1)`.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered some valuable context about the issue at hand:\n\n1. **NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis Class**: We found the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class within `sklearn/neighbors/nca.py`. This class includes several methods, but most notably for our issue, it contains a `_validate_params` method. This method is likely where parameter validation occurs for the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class. Since the issue mentions problems with parameter checks failing during grid searches, particularly with types and values, this method is a critical area to investigate.\n\n2. **_check_params Method in LDA**: The search for the `_check_params` method within an LDA class did not yield any results. This could mean that either the class name provided was incorrect, or parameter checking in LDA (or a similar class) is done differently or under a different method name. This limits our ability to directly compare parameter checking across different classes as initially intended.\n\n3. **check_param Method**: The search did not find a `check_param` method in the codebase, which suggests that the proposed common parameter checking tool or method does not yet exist. This aligns with the issue's suggestion to introduce a more standardized way of checking parameters across the codebase.\n\nGiven this context, the primary focus should be on the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class and its `_validate_params` method. This method is where we can potentially adjust the parameter validation logic to be more flexible with types (e.g., accepting `np.int64` as an `int` and ensuring floats are correctly validated even if they are integers like `1` instead of `1.0`).\n\nAdditionally, the absence of a common parameter checking tool (`check_param`) in the codebase supports the issue's suggestion to develop such a tool. This tool could standardize parameter validation across different estimators, reducing redundancy and potentially preventing similar issues in the future.\n\nTo move forward, we should:\n- Review and potentially adjust the `_validate_params` method in the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class to handle the mentioned cases more gracefully.\n- Consider the design and implementation of a common parameter checking tool that could be used across the codebase, taking into account the proposed API and functionality.\n\nNext steps could involve drafting a proposal for the `check_param` method, considering how it could be integrated with existing classes like `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis`, and planning for broader adoption across the codebase."
