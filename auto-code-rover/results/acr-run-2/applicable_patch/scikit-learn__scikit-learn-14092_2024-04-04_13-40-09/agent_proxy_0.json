            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the classes and methods mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we should look into the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class to understand how parameter checking is currently implemented. Additionally, examining the `_check_params` method in the context of another class (like LDA, as mentioned) could provide insights into how parameter validation is handled across different parts of the codebase. This will help us understand the current state of parameter checking and how it might be improved or standardized.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis\")`: This will help us understand how the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class is implemented, particularly how it checks its parameters.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_check_params\", \"LDA\")`: Since LDA was mentioned as an example of how parameter checking is done, this will give us insights into the current approach to parameter validation in a different context, which could be useful for comparison.\n\n3. `search_method(\"check_param\")`: This will help us find if the proposed `check_param` method or something similar already exists in the codebase, which could be a starting point for implementing a common parameter checking tool."
