It could provide insights into how arguments are parsed and validated.\n\nTo proceed, we should examine the specific code snippets within these files that relate to `msg-template`. This will help us understand how Pylint is intended to process the message template argument and why it might be failing to recognize custom braces in the newer version. \n\nGiven the results, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. Investigating the references to `msg-template` in `pylint/reporters/text.py` to understand how message templates are formatted and why the warning is generated.\n2. Looking into `pylint/lint/base_options.py` to see how the `--msg-template` argument is defined and handled, which might reveal changes in argument processing between versions.\n\nThese steps will provide a foundation for identifying the root cause of the issue and developing a patch to resolve it."
