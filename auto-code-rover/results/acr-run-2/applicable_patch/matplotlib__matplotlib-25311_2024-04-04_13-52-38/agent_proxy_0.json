            "content": "To address the issue of being unable to pickle a figure with a draggable legend in Matplotlib, we need to gather more context about how pickling is handled in Matplotlib, especially regarding figures and draggable elements like legends. Given the error message `TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`, it seems relevant to understand how the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class is involved in the pickling process and how the `set_draggable` method on the legend affects this.\n\nLet's start by investigating the following areas in the Matplotlib codebase:\n\n1. The implementation of the `Figure` class to understand how figures are generally pickled.\n2. The `set_draggable` method in the context of the legend to see if there are any specific behaviors that might interfere with pickling.\n3. The `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class to understand why it cannot be pickled and if there are any workarounds or specific reasons for this limitation.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Figure\")`: To get an overview of the `Figure` class implementation.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"set_draggable\", \"Legend\")`: To understand how the `set_draggable` method is implemented for legends.\n- `search_class(\"FigureCanvasQTAgg\")`: To explore the implementation of the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class and its relation to the pickling issue."
