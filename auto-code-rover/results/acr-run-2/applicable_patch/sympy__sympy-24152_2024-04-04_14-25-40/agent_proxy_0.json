            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the `TensorProduct` class and the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we should look into the implementation details of the `TensorProduct` class to understand its structure and how the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method fits into it. Additionally, understanding how the `args_cnc` method is used within the context of `TensorProduct` could provide valuable insights into the proposed fix. Therefore, I will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"TensorProduct\")`: This will help us locate the `TensorProduct` class within the codebase and understand its relationship with other classes, especially how it interacts with the `Operator` class and the `expand` method.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_eval_expand_tensorproduct\", \"TensorProduct\")`: This will provide us with the current implementation details of the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method within the `TensorProduct` class, which is directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n3. `search_method(\"args_cnc\")`: Since the proposed fix involves the use of the `args_cnc` method, understanding its functionality and how it's used across the codebase could provide insights into the implications of the proposed changes. \n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the issue and the proposed fix."
