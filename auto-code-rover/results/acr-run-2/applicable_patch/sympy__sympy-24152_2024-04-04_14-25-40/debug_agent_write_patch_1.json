        "content": "<issue>Bug in expand of TensorProduct + Workaround + Fix\n### Error description\nThe expansion of a TensorProduct object stops incomplete if summands in the tensor product factors have (scalar) factors, e.g.\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum import *\nU = Operator('U')\nV = Operator('V')\nP = TensorProduct(2*U - V, U + V)\nprint(P)\n# (2*U - V)x(U + V)\nprint(P.expand(tensorproduct=True))\n#result: 2*Ux(U + V) - Vx(U + V) #expansion has missed 2nd tensor factor and is incomplete\n```\nThis is clearly not the expected behaviour. It also effects other functions that rely on .expand(tensorproduct=True), as e.g. qapply() .\n### Work around\nRepeat .expand(tensorproduct=True) as may times as there are tensor factors, resp. until the expanded term does no longer change. This is however only reasonable in interactive session and not in algorithms.\n### Code Fix\n.expand relies on the method TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct(). The issue arises from an inprecise check in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() whether a recursive call is required; it fails when the creation of a TensorProduct object returns commutative (scalar) factors up front: in that case the constructor returns a Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..)).\nI thus propose the following  code fix in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() in quantum/tensorproduct.py.  I have marked the four lines to be added / modified:\n```\ndef _eval_expand_tensorproduct(self, **hints):\n...\nfor aa in args[i].args:\ntp = TensorProduct(*args[:i] + (aa,) + args[i + 1:])\nc_part, nc_part = tp.args_cnc() #added\nif len(nc_part)==1 and isinstance(nc_part[0], TensorProduct): #modified\nnc_part = (nc_part[0]._eval_expand_tensorproduct(), ) #modified\nadd_args.append(Mul(*c_part)*Mul(*nc_part)) #modified\nbreak\n...\n```\nThe fix splits of commutative (scalar) factors from the tp returned. The TensorProduct object will be the one nc factor in nc_part (see TensorProduct.__new__ constructor), if any. Note that the constructor will return 0 if a tensor factor is 0, so there is no guarantee that tp contains a TensorProduct object (e.g. TensorProduct(U-U, U+V).\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, we can analyze the issue and the proposed fix in detail:\n\n1. **TensorProduct Class**: The `TensorProduct` class is found in three different files within the codebase, but the relevant one for this issue is located in `sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py`. This class is designed to handle tensor products, particularly in the context of quantum mechanics, and it is not commutative (`is_commutative = False`). The class provides various methods to manipulate tensor products, including the method `_eval_expand_tensorproduct`, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\n2. **_eval_expand_tensorproduct Method**: The current implementation of the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method in `sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py` is designed to distribute `TensorProduct` instances across addition. The method iterates through the arguments of the tensor product, and if any argument is an instance of `Add`, it attempts to distribute the tensor product across these additive components. However, as reported in the issue, this implementation does not handle cases where the tensor product factors have scalar factors, leading to incomplete expansion.\n\n3. **args_cnc Method**: The `args_cnc` method, found in `sympy/core/expr.py` and also in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py`, is used to separate the commutative and non-commutative parts of an expression. Specifically, it treats the expression as a multiplication (`Mul`) and maintains the ordering of the factors, separating them into commutative and non-commutative lists. This method is crucial for the proposed fix, as it allows the identification and separation of scalar (commutative) factors from the tensor product factors (non-commutative), enabling a more precise check for when a recursive call to `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` is needed.\n\n**Analysis of the Issue and Proposed Fix**:\n- The issue arises because the current implementation of `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` does not account for the presence of scalar factors in the tensor product factors, leading to incomplete expansion.\n- The proposed fix aims to address this by using the `args_cnc` method to separate commutative and non-commutative parts of the tensor product. This allows for a more accurate determination of when a recursive call is necessary, ensuring that scalar factors are correctly handled and the expansion is complete.\n- Specifically, the fix involves checking if the non-commutative part (`nc_part`) contains exactly one `TensorProduct` instance and then performing the expansion on this part, while preserving the scalar (commutative) factors.\n\nGiven this analysis, the proposed fix seems appropriate for addressing the reported issue by ensuring that scalar factors in tensor product factors are correctly handled during expansion."
