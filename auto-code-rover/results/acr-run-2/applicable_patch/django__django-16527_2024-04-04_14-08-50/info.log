The logic includes checks for `not is_popup` and `has_change_permission`, and it also checks if the operation is a change operation (`and change`). However, as pointed out in the issue, it lacks a check for `has_add_permission`, which is essential for ensuring that the user has the permission to add a new object.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `has_add_permission`**:\n   - The method `has_add_permission` is found in several files, with multiple occurrences in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. This suggests that `has_add_permission` is a method likely associated with admin options or permissions handling within the Django admin framework. Its presence in tests and other admin-related files further confirms its role in permission checking.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from an incomplete permission check in the "show_save_as_new" logic. The current implementation ensures that the user has the permission to change an object (`has_change_permission`) and that the operation is a change operation, but it does not verify if the user has the permission to add a new object, which is critical for the "save as new" functionality.\n\nTo address this issue, a patch needs to include a check for `has_add_permission` in the logic that determines the visibility of the "show_save_as_new" button. This will ensure that the button is only shown to users who have both the permission to change the current object and the permission to add new objects.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the `submit_row` function in `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` to include this missing permission check.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
