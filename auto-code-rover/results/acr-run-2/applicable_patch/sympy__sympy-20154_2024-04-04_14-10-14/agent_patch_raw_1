# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/utilities/iterables.py</file>
<original>if size:
    yield sum(ms.values()), ms
else:
    yield ms</original>
<patched>if size:
    yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
else:
    yield ms.copy()</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/utilities/iterables.py</file>
<original>if size:
    yield 0, {}
else:
    yield {}</original>
<patched>if size:
    yield 0, {}
else:
    yield {}</patched>
```
(Note: The second modification is actually unnecessary as the original code does not reuse dictionaries in this specific case. It's included here for completeness, but the real issue and the fix are addressed in modification 1 where the dictionary `ms` is copied before yielding.)
