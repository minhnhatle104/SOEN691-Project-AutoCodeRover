In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how Django handles file uploads, specifically focusing on the permissions set for uploaded files and how these permissions might vary based on the temporary storage method used (MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile). The issue mentions a discrepancy in file permissions when using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` + `os.rename` sequence, leading to files having `0o0600` permissions on some systems.\n\nGiven this context, we should look into the following areas of the Django codebase:\n\n1. The implementation of file upload handling, particularly focusing on how Django decides between using `MemoryUploadedFile` or `TemporaryUploadedFile`.\n2. The default settings for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to understand its default value and how it's applied to uploaded files.\n3. The use of `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and `os.rename` in the context of file uploads to see how permissions are being set.\n\nBased on these areas, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n- `search_code(\"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\")`: This will help us find where the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` are defined or used within the Django codebase.\n- `search_class(\"FileSystemStorage\")`: Since the issue mentions files uploaded to `FileSystemStorage`, we should look into this class to understand how it handles file permissions.\n- `search_method(\"save\", \"FileSystemStorage\")`: Specifically, we want to see how the `save` method in `FileSystemStorage` handles file permissions, as this is likely where the uploaded file is finally saved and its permissions are set.\n- `search_code(\"tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile\")`: To understand how Django uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` in the context of file uploads and how it might affect file permissions.\n- `search_code(\"os.rename\")`: Since `os.rename` is mentioned in conjunction with setting file permissions, we should look into its usage as well.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how Django handles file uploads, the default file permissions, and any discrepancies that might arise based on the temporary storage method used."

The discrepancy in file permissions (`0o0600` vs. the expected `0o644`) could be due to how `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` sets permissions on temporary files for security reasons, and these permissions might not be correctly adjusted to match the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting when the file is moved to its permanent location using `os.rename`.\n\nTo address this issue, we would need to ensure that:\n- The `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is correctly applied to all files moved from temporary to permanent storage.\n- Adjustments are made either in the `_save` method of `FileSystemStorage` or during the file move process to ensure the permissions are set according to the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, regardless of the temporary file's initial permissions.\n\nFurther steps would involve reviewing the implementation of the `_save` method in `FileSystemStorage`, how `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and `os.rename` are used in conjunction with file uploads, and ensuring that the transition from temporary to permanent storage respects the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting."

        "content": "Based on the search results, let's analyze the context and information we've gathered to address the issue regarding file upload permissions in Django:\n\n1. **FileSystemStorage and FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS**:\n   - The search within `django/core/files/storage.py` revealed two snippets where `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is referenced. The first snippet within the `_clear_cached_properties` function suggests that `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is a setting that can influence the behavior of `FileSystemStorage` by clearing cached properties related to file permissions. This indicates that changes to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` are expected to dynamically affect how file permissions are handled.\n   - The second snippet is from a `@cached_property` named `file_permissions_mode`, which directly retrieves the value from `settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. This property likely determines the permissions set on files when they are saved. It confirms that `FileSystemStorage` uses the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting to define file permissions, providing a direct link between the setting and the applied file permissions.\n\n2. **TemporaryUploadedFile and tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile**:\n   - The snippet from `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py` shows the `TemporaryUploadedFile` class initializing a temporary file using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`. The temporary file is created with a specific suffix and directory, derived from the uploaded file's name and the configured temporary directory (`settings.FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR`). This is relevant because it shows how Django handles temporary files during the upload process, which is a critical part of the issue described.\n\n3. **File Movement and os.rename**:\n   - The snippets from `django/core/files/move.py` provide insights into how Django attempts to move files using `os.rename`. The `file_move_safe` function first tries `os.rename` for moving files but falls back to a manual streaming method if `os.rename` fails (e.g., when moving across filesystems or when dealing with opened files on certain operating systems). This behavior is crucial because it highlights a potential area where file permissions might not be preserved or applied consistently, especially if the fallback method does not explicitly set permissions based on `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how Django handles file permissions during the upload process, particularly when moving files from temporary storage to their final location. The discrepancy in file permissions (`0o0600` vs. the expected `0o644`) could be due to several factors:\n- The initial permissions set by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` might not be overridden or adjusted when the file is moved to its permanent location.\n- The process of moving files, especially when falling back from `os.rename` to manual streaming, might not correctly apply the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`.\n\nTo address this issue, potential fixes could involve ensuring that:\n- The `file_permissions_mode` property in `FileSystemStorage` is correctly used to set permissions on all files after they are moved to their permanent location.\n- The file move process (especially the manual streaming fallback in `file_move_safe`) explicitly sets file permissions based on `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` after a successful move.\n\nThese adjustments would help ensure that all uploaded files have consistent permissions, as defined by the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, regardless of the upload process's temporary storage mechanism or the filesystem behavior."
