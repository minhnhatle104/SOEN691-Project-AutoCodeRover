Given the limitations in directly accessing and modifying the specific function `_read_table_qdp` due to the lack of direct code snippets for it, and considering the structure of the `read` method in the `QDP` class, a more general approach to address the issue would be to preprocess the lines to ensure they are in the expected case format before they are processed by `_read_table_qdp`. This approach assumes that modifying the lines at the point they are read and passed to `_read_table_qdp` is feasible and will not disrupt other functionalities. 

Since the direct modification within `_read_table_qdp` cannot be provided without its code, let's propose a patch at the level of the `read` method in the `QDP` class, where we can ensure the lines are treated in a case-insensitive manner by converting them to uppercase before they are processed further.

# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py</file>
<original>
def read(self, table):
    self.lines = self.inputter.get_lines(table, newline="\n")
    return _read_table_qdp(
        self.lines,
        table_id=self.table_id,
        names=self.names,
        delimiter=self.delimiter,
    )
</original>
<patched>
def read(self, table):
    self.lines = [line.upper() for line in self.inputter.get_lines(table, newline="\n")]
    return _read_table_qdp(
        self.lines,
        table_id=self.table_id,
        names=self.names,
        delimiter=self.delimiter,
    )
</patched>
```

This modification converts all lines read from the QDP file to uppercase before they are passed to the `_read_table_qdp` function. This approach ensures that all commands and parameters within the QDP file are treated in a case-insensitive manner, aligning with the behavior of QDP itself, which is not case-sensitive. 

It's important to note that this patch assumes that converting all lines to uppercase will not negatively impact other parts of the QDP file processing. If there are aspects of the QDP format that are case-sensitive (beyond the commands), further adjustments might be necessary to selectively apply this case normalization only to the command lines.
