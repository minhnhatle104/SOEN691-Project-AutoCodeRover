Specifically, I need to understand how it's currently implemented to assess where and how to add logging for exceptions. Therefore, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"send_robust\")`: This will help me find where the `send_robust` method is defined in the codebase, providing a starting point for understanding its current behavior and implementation details.\n\n2. `search_class(\"Signal\")`: Since the method `send_robust` is part of the `Signal` class, this search will help me find the class definition. This is important for understanding the context in which `send_robust` operates, including any related methods or class variables that might be relevant for adding exception logging.\n\nThese searches will provide the necessary context to start working on a patch for the issue."
