```python
<file>django/dispatch/dispatcher.py</file>
<original>            except Exception as err:
                responses.append((receiver, err))</original>
<patched>            except Exception as err:
                # Import logging at the top of the file
                import logging
                logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
                logger.exception("Exception raised by signal receiver: %r", receiver)
                responses.append((receiver, err))</patched>
```

Note: The `import logging` statement should ideally be placed at the top of the file, not within the `except` block. The modification shows it within the block for clarity on where the logging module is used. In practice, move the import statement to the top of the file to follow Python's convention.
