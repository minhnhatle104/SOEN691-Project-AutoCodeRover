<original>        if options['command']:
            exec(options['command'])
            return</original>
<patched>        if options['command']:
            exec(options['command'], {'__builtins__': __builtins__, 'django': django})
            return</patched>
```

Explanation:
The patch modifies the `exec` call within the `handle` method of the `shell.py` file. By providing a dictionary as the second argument to `exec`, we define a minimal global context that includes both the Python built-ins (accessible via `__builtins__`) and the `django` module itself. This ensures that the executed code has access to necessary global variables and modules, such as `django`, resolving the `NameError` encountered when trying to access `django` within the executed code block. 

Note: This patch assumes that the `django` module is imported at the top of the `shell.py` file. If it's not already imported, you would need to add an import statement (`import django`) at the beginning of the file.
