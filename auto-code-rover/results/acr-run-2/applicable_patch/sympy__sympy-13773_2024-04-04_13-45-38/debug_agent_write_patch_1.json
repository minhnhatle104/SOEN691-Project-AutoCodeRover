The current implementation of `__matmul__` in `MatrixArithmetic` simply delegates to `__mul__`, which allows for scalar multiplication, thus not adhering to the expected behavior of matrix multiplication where both operands should be matrices.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to modify the `__matmul__` method in both classes to ensure that it only allows matrix multiplication when both operands are matrices, similar to how NumPy handles matrix multiplication. This involves checking the type of the operands and raising an exception if one of them is not a matrix.\n\nLet's proceed to draft patches for both `MatrixArithmetic` and `MatrixExpr` classes to enforce the correct behavior for `__matmul__`."

This check is used to determine if the `other` operand is a matrix. If it is not (i.e., it does not have a `shape` attribute), a `ValueError` is raised with a message guiding the user to use the `*` operator for scalar multiplication. This approach aligns the behavior with that of NumPy, as described in the issue."
