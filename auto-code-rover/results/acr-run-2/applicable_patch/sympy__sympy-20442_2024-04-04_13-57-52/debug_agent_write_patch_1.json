Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, the `convert_to` function is primarily defined in `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. This function is designed to convert expressions involving units to expressions with their units and quantities represented as factors of target units, provided the dimensions are compatible. The function handles various types of inputs, including single units/quantities or collections thereof, and supports conversions within a specified unit system (defaulting to \"SI\").\n\nThe issue reported involves an unexpected result when attempting to convert `joule*second` to `joule`, where the output is `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. This suggests that there might be a problem with how the function handles unit expressions that involve multiplication or division of units, particularly when the target unit does not directly match the units in the expression being converted.\n\nThe `convert_to` function performs several key operations:\n1. It checks if the target units are in an iterable format and converts them to a list if not.\n2. It handles expressions that are sums (`Add`) by converting each term individually.\n3. It replaces quantities within the expression with their converted counterparts if they are instances of `Quantity`.\n4. It calculates a total scale factor for the expression and uses a conversion matrix (`_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`) to adjust the expression according to the target units.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem might lie in how the conversion matrix is generated or applied, or in how the total scale factor is calculated and used, especially in cases where the conversion does not directly align with the target units.\n\nTo address the issue, it would be necessary to:\n- Review the logic for generating and applying the conversion matrix to ensure it correctly handles cases where the target units are not a straightforward match for the units in the original expression.\n- Examine the calculation of the total scale factor to ensure it accurately reflects the intended conversion, particularly in complex unit expressions involving multiplication or division of units.\n- Consider adding more explicit handling or error reporting for cases where the conversion cannot be performed as expected, to provide clearer feedback to the user.\n\nFurther investigation and potential debugging of the `convert_to` function's implementation in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` would be required to identify the specific cause of the issue and develop a suitable patch."
