            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to gather more context about the implementation details of the `constrained_layout` feature and how it interacts with `plt.subplots_adjust` and `bbox_inches='tight'`. Given the information provided in the issue, I will start by searching for the relevant classes and methods that are likely involved in this bug.\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a warning generated when using `plt.subplots_adjust` in conjunction with `constrained_layout=False`, it's crucial to understand how `subplots_adjust` is implemented and how it checks for `constrained_layout` settings. Therefore, I will search for the `subplots_adjust` method in the codebase.\n\n2. The warning message specifically mentions a layout engine being incompatible with `subplots_adjust` and/or `tight_layout`. This suggests that there might be a method or a check related to the layout engine's compatibility with these settings. I will search for methods related to `constrained_layout` to understand how it's being checked or applied across the library.\n\n3. Given that the issue is related to layout settings and warnings are generated, it's also important to understand where and how these warnings are generated. This might involve searching for the specific warning message in the codebase to find the exact point where the warning is issued.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will perform the following search API calls:\n\n- search_method(\"subplots_adjust\")\n- search_method(\"constrained_layout\")\n- search_code(\"This figure was using a layout engine that is incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; not calling subplots_adjust.\")"
