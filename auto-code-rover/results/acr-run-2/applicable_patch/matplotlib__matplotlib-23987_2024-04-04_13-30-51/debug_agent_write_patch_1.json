Given the information provided in the issue, I will start by searching for the relevant classes and methods that are likely involved in this bug.\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a warning generated when using `plt.subplots_adjust` in conjunction with `constrained_layout=False`, it's crucial to understand how `subplots_adjust` is implemented and how it checks for `constrained_layout` settings. Therefore, I will search for the `subplots_adjust` method in the codebase.\n\n2. The warning message specifically mentions a layout engine being incompatible with `subplots_adjust` and/or `tight_layout`. This suggests that there might be a method or a check related to the layout engine's compatibility with these settings. I will search for methods related to `constrained_layout` to understand how it's being checked or applied across the library.\n\n3. Given that the issue is related to layout settings and warnings are generated, it's also important to understand where and how these warnings are generated.

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some valuable insights into the issue at hand:\n\n1. **`subplots_adjust` Method Implementation**:\n   - The `subplots_adjust` method is found in two places within the codebase: `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` and within the `FigureBase` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`.\n   - The implementation in `pyplot.py` is a wrapper that calls `subplots_adjust` on the current figure (`gcf()`), passing through any arguments it receives.\n   - The more relevant implementation for our issue is in `FigureBase` class within `figure.py`. This method adjusts the subplot layout parameters unless a condition related to the layout engine's compatibility is met. If the layout engine is set and marked as incompatible with adjustments (`adjust_compatible` is `False`), a warning is issued, and the method returns early without applying the adjustments.\n\n2. **Warning Generation**:\n   - The warning that the issue describes is generated within the `subplots_adjust` method of the `FigureBase` class. This occurs when the layout engine in use is marked as incompatible with `subplots_adjust` and/or `tight_layout`. The check involves evaluating `self.get_layout_engine().adjust_compatible`.\n\n3. **`constrained_layout` Method**:\n   - The search did not find a method specifically named `constrained_layout` in the codebase. This suggests that `constrained_layout` might be a parameter or a property that influences the choice or configuration of the layout engine rather than a method itself.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how the `constrained_layout` setting influences the choice of the layout engine and its compatibility flag (`adjust_compatible`). The warning is generated because, when `constrained_layout=False`, the layout engine still considers itself incompatible with `subplots_adjust`, possibly due to how it's configured or initialized.\n\n**Next Steps for Patching**:\n- Investigate how the layout engine is selected and configured, especially in relation to the `constrained_layout` parameter. This might involve looking into the `FigureBase` initialization or methods related to layout engine configuration.\n- Determine why the layout engine remains marked as incompatible (`adjust_compatible=False`) even when `constrained_layout=False`. There might be a need to ensure that the layout engine's compatibility flag correctly reflects the `constrained_layout` setting.\n- Consider adding or modifying checks around the warning in `subplots_adjust` to more accurately determine when it should be issued, ensuring it aligns with the user's explicit settings for `constrained_layout`.\n\nTo proceed, we would need to explore the initialization and configuration of the layout engine in relation to `constrained_layout`. However, given the constraints of this interaction, direct code exploration and modification are not possible. The analysis above outlines a theoretical approach to addressing the issue based on the provided context."

Ideally, one would look into how the layout engine is initialized and how its compatibility flag is set in relation to `constrained_layout`.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\n**Buggy files and methods:**\n- **File:** `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`\n- **Class:** `FigureBase`\n- **Method:** `subplots_adjust`\n\nThe bug is related to how the `subplots_adjust` method in the `FigureBase` class checks the layout engine's compatibility (`adjust_compatible`) and decides to issue a warning even when `constrained_layout=False`.

If such a method does not exist, it would need to be implemented or an alternative approach to access the `constrained_layout` setting would be required."
