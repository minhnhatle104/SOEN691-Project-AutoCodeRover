Given the information in the issue, we will start by searching for these methods to find their definitions and usage. Additionally, we will look for the class that might contain these methods if they are part of a specific class structure.\n\n1. `search_method(\"dmp_zz_mignotte_bound\")`: This will help us find where the `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` method is defined and used across the codebase.\n2. `search_method(\"dup_zz_mignotte_bound\")`: Similarly, this search will provide us with information on the `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` method's definition and usage.\n3. `search_class(\"factortools\")`: Since the issue mentions `sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`, searching for the `factortools` class will help us understand the structure and other related methods or classes within the same module."
