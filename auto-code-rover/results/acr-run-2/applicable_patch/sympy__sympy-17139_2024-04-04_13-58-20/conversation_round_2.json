If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(1 - log(a)))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n\n    If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n    x belongs to the set where this relation is true. The default is\n    False.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    expr = sympify(expr)\n    kwargs = dict(ratio=ratio, measure=measure,\n        rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n\n    # no routine for Expr needs to check for is_zero\n    if isinstance(expr, Expr) and expr.is_zero and expr*0 is S.Zero:\n        return S.Zero\n\n    _eval_simplify = getattr(expr, '_eval_simplify', None)\n    if _eval_simplify is not None:\n        return _eval_simplify(ratio=ratio, measure=measure, rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n\n    original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n\n    from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n    from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n    from sympy import Sum, Product, Integral\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n        return expr\n\n    if inverse and expr.has(Function):\n        expr = inversecombine(expr)\n        if not expr.args:  # simplified to atomic\n            return expr\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n        return expr.func(*[simplify(x, **kwargs) for x in expr.args])\n\n    if not expr.is_commutative:\n        expr = nc_simplify(expr)\n\n    # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n    # is it a purely rational function?

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into the underlying issue and potential paths towards a solution. The issue arises when attempting to simplify an expression involving `cos(x)**I` (where `I` is the imaginary unit in SymPy), leading to a `TypeError` due to an invalid comparison of complex `I`. Let's break down the relevant parts of the traceback and the search results to understand the problem better.\n\n### Traceback Analysis\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The issue starts with the `simplify` function in `simplify/simplify.py`. The `simplify` function is a general-purpose simplifier that applies various strategies to simplify the given expression. It eventually leads to a call to `trigsimp` for trigonometric simplification.\n\n2. **Trigonometric Simplification**: The `trigsimp` function in `simplify/trigsimp.py` is designed to reduce expressions by using known trig identities. It supports multiple methods, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. The traceback does not specify which method led to the error, but it eventually calls functions from `fu.py`.\n\n3. **FU Transformations**: The `TR6` function in `fu.py` is specifically mentioned in the traceback. `TR6` is a transformation that replaces `cos**2` with `1 - sin(x)**2`. It calls `_TR56`, a helper function for transformations `TR5` and `TR6`, to perform the actual replacement.\n\n4. **Invalid Comparison**: The error occurs in `_TR56` when it checks conditions on the exponent of a power expression (`rv.exp`). The comparison `(rv.exp < 0) == True` fails with a `TypeError` because `rv.exp` is complex (`I`), and SymPy's `Expr` class does not support direct comparisons of complex numbers in its `__lt__` method.\n\n### Problem Summary\n\nThe core issue is that the `_TR56` function in `fu.py` attempts to compare an exponent that is complex (`I`) with 0, which is not valid in SymPy. SymPy's `Expr` class explicitly raises a `TypeError` when attempting to compare complex numbers, as seen in the `__lt__` method of the `Expr` class.\n\n### Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Handle Complex Exponents**: Modify `_TR56` (or the code leading to its invocation) to handle cases where the exponent is complex. This could involve checking if the exponent is complex and either skipping the transformation or handling it in a special way that does not involve invalid comparisons.\n\n2. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance the error handling in the `__lt__` method of the `Expr` class or in `_TR56` to provide more informative error messages or to gracefully handle cases involving complex numbers.\n\n3. **Documentation and Validation**: Update the documentation to clearly state the limitations regarding complex exponents in transformations like `TR6`. Additionally, introduce validation steps early in the simplification process to catch and handle expressions with complex exponents before they lead to errors.\n\nThe next step would be to draft a patch addressing these potential solutions, focusing on preventing the invalid comparison while preserving the intended functionality of the simplification process."
