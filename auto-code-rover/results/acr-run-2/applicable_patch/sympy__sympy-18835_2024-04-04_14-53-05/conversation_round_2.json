        "content": "The `uniq` function from the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file is designed to yield unique elements from a given sequence (`seq`) as an iterator. The implementation uses a set named `seen` to track elements that have already been encountered. If an element is not in `seen`, it is yielded and added to `seen`. This approach ensures that each element in the output is unique. The function also handles cases where elements of the sequence are not hashable (i.e., cannot be added to a set) by falling back to a list named `result` to track seen elements.\n\nThe issue reported is related to modifying a list while iterating over it using the `uniq` function. The user expects a `RuntimeError` similar to what Python raises when modifying a dictionary or set during iteration. However, the current implementation of `uniq` does not check if the input sequence (`seq`) is modified during iteration, leading to potentially incorrect or unexpected results without any error or warning.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to modify the `uniq` function to detect changes in the size of the input sequence during iteration and raise a `RuntimeError` if such changes are detected. This involves tracking the size of the input sequence at the start of the function and comparing it against the current size as the iteration progresses. If a discrepancy in size is detected, it indicates that the input sequence has been modified, and an error should be raised to alert the user to this unsafe operation. \n\nNext steps will involve drafting a patch to implement this behavior change."
