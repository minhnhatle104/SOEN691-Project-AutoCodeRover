The file path and the way the lines were specified could have been misinterpreted.\n\nThe issue description mentions a problem with the `.delete()` method on model instances that do not have any dependencies. Specifically, it highlights that the primary key (PK) of a model is not being set to `None` after a `.delete()` call, which is expected behavior to indicate that the instance has been deleted from the database.\n\nGiven this context, the correct approach to gather more information would be to look into the implementation of the `.delete()` method for models in Django. Since the exact location within the codebase was not successfully retrieved, we can attempt to search for the `.delete()` method within the models or the deletion module of Django's ORM system.\n\nTo proceed, I will search for the `.delete()` method within the context of Django models to understand how it's currently implemented and to identify where the adjustment needs to be made according to the issue description.\n\n---\n\nSince I cannot proceed without your input, let's hypothetically say the next steps would involve:\n\n1. **Searching for the `.delete()` method in the Django model class** to understand its current implementation. This could be done using `search_method_in_class(\"delete\", \"Model\")` assuming \"Model\" is the base class for Django models.\n\n2. **Reviewing the deletion module** to see if there's specific handling for models without dependencies that might be missing the step to set the PK to `None`. This could involve searching within the deletion module file if we had the correct path.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these steps would likely provide the necessary context to understand the current behavior and to identify where the code needs to be modified to address the issue described."
