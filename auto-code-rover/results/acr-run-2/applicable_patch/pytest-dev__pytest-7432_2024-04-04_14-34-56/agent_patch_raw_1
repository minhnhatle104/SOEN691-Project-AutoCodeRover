<patched># Removed the pass under runxfail to allow further processing for skip location adjustment
elif item.config.option.runxfail:
    # This condition is now empty to not prematurely exit the function,
    # allowing the handling of skipped tests below to proceed even when runxfail is active.</patched>

```

These modifications aim to address the issue where using `--runxfail` breaks the expected skip location reporting by allowing the skip location adjustment logic to proceed even when `runxfail` is active. The second modification corrects the line number reporting to accurately reflect the location of the skipped test without artificially incrementing it.
