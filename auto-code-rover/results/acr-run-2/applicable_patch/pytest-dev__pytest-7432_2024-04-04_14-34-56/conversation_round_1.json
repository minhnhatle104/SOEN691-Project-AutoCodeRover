        "content": "Analyzing the provided context from the `pytest_runtest_makereport` method in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, we can identify several key points relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **Purpose of the Method**: The `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook is used to process the test report after a test execution. It modifies the report based on certain conditions, such as handling unexpected successes, handling xfail (expected failures), and handling skipped tests.\n\n2. **Handling of Skipped Tests**: The section of the code that is most relevant to the issue is the last part, where it checks if the test was skipped due to a mark (`item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True) and rep.skipped`) and then modifies the `longrepr` attribute of the report. This attribute is used to display the skip reason and location.\n\n3. **Modification of Skip Location**: For tests skipped by `mark.skipif`, the code attempts to change the location of the failure to point to the item definition (the test function itself) instead of where the skip exception was raised within pytest. This is done by setting `rep.longrepr` to a tuple containing the filename, the line number (adjusted by +1), and the skip reason.\n\n4. **Issue with `--runxfail`**: The issue reported is that when `--runxfail` is used, the expected behavior of reporting the skip location as the test item itself breaks, and instead, it points to the internal pytest code (`src/_pytest/skipping.py:238`). Given the code snippet, there's a specific check for `item.config.option.runxfail` with a comment `# don't interfere`, suggesting that when `runxfail` is active, it might be intentionally not modifying certain behaviors. However, this seems to inadvertently affect the skip location reporting.\n\n5. **Potential Solution Path**: To address the issue, we need to ensure that the modification of the skip location (the `longrepr` attribute) works correctly even when `--runxfail` is active. This might involve adjusting the logic around the `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` check or ensuring that the skip location adjustment logic is not bypassed or negatively impacted by other conditions related to `runxfail`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve drafting a patch that ensures the skip location is correctly reported when `--runxfail` is used, potentially by refining the conditions under which the skip location adjustment logic is applied."
