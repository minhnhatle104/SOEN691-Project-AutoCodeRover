Given the information provided in the issue, I will start by searching for code snippets and methods that are likely involved in handling this header. \n\n1. Since the issue mentions an exception being raised when the `If-Modified-Since` header is an empty string, it's crucial to find where this header is parsed or checked. I'll start by searching for any code snippets that reference this header directly.\n\n2. The issue also mentions a specific commit `d6aff369ad3` where the behavior changed. While I can't directly search by commit in this interface, knowing the change happened recently might help narrow down where to look if we know which files or methods were recently modified. However, without direct access to the repository's commit history through this interface, I'll focus on the content of the issue.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n- `search_code(\"If-Modified-Since\")`: This will help identify where in the codebase the `If-Modified-Since` header is being referenced or handled.\n- `search_code(\"empty string\")`: Since the issue specifically mentions problems with handling an empty string, this search might reveal where in the codebase empty strings are being checked or mishandled, potentially leading to the exception mentioned."
