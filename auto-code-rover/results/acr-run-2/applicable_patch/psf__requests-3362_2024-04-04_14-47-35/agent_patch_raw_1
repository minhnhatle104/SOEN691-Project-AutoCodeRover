Based on the context and the issue described, it seems the confusion or the problem arises from the expectation that `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` should behave similarly to accessing `r.text` in terms of decoding the content to unicode. However, `iter_content` is returning bytes instead of unicode. The provided code snippets for `iter_content` and `text` methods from `requests/models.py` show that both methods handle decoding but might have differences in their approach, especially in error handling and encoding detection.

To address the issue, we can ensure that `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True` behaves more consistently with `r.text` by improving the encoding detection and error handling in `iter_content`. However, without altering the fundamental behavior of streaming content in chunks, a direct equivalence in behavior might not be fully achievable due to the inherent differences in how these methods are designed to work.

Here's a hypothetical patch that aims to improve the encoding handling in `iter_content`:

# modification 1
```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>if decode_unicode:
            chunks = stream_decode_response_unicode(chunks, self)</original>
<patched>if decode_unicode:
            encoding = self.encoding if self.encoding is not None else self.apparent_encoding
            chunks = (chunk.decode(encoding, errors='replace') for chunk in chunks)</patched>
```

This modification assumes the existence of a utility function or method similar to `stream_decode_response_unicode` that was not directly found in the provided context. The patched version directly uses the response's encoding (if set) or falls back to `apparent_encoding` for decoding, similar to how `r.text` handles encoding. It also applies error handling with `errors='replace'` to match the behavior seen in `r.text`.

Please note, this patch is hypothetical and based on the assumption that enhancing the encoding handling in `iter_content` would address the issue. It's crucial to test this change thoroughly in the context of the `requests` library to ensure it does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior changes, especially considering the streaming nature of `iter_content` and its use cases.
