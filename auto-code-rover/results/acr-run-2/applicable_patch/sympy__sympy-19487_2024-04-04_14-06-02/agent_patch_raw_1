**Note:** The modifications above are based on the understanding of the issue and the context provided by the search results. The actual implementation might require further adjustments, especially considering how the library handles zero and undefined expressions. The patch for `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` assumes the addition of a new method or the modification of an existing one to handle the rewrite logic, which was not directly found in the search results. The modifications aim to illustrate the approach rather than provide a final solution. Further testing and review would be necessary to ensure the changes address the issue without introducing new problems.
