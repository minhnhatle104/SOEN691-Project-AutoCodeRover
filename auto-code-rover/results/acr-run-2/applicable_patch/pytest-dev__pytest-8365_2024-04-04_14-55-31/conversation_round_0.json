I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\n```\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\ndef mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\n\"\"\"\nCreate a new directory at this given path.\n\"\"\"\nif self._closed:\nself._raise_closed()\ntry:\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\n```\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\n```bat\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\npy.test test_tmp.py\n```\nThanks for having a look at this!\n</issue>"
