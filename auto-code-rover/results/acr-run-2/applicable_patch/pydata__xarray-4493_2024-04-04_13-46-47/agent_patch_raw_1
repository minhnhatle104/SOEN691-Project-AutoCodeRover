        compat="override"  # Ensure that chunking information is preserved by using override compatibility
    )</patched>
```

**Explanation**: The patch modifies the call to `merge_core` within the `dataset_update_method` function. By adding the `compat="override"` argument, we aim to ensure that the chunking information of `DataArray` objects is preserved during the merge process. This change is based on the assumption that the default behavior of `merge_core` may not adequately handle the preservation of chunking information, and explicitly setting the compatibility to "override" could help maintain the chunked nature of `DataArray` objects after an update. This solution assumes that the `merge_core` function supports a `compat` parameter that influences how data arrays are merged, specifically regarding their chunking information. If `merge_core` does not support this parameter or if the parameter does not affect chunking as expected, further modifications to the `merge_core` function or a different approach may be necessary.
