        "content": "Based on the collected context, we can start analyzing the issue related to the `apart` function and its interaction with symbolic expressions in SymPy. Here's a summary of the relevant findings:\n\n### `apart` Function\n- **Location and Implementation**: The `apart` function is primarily defined in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`. It's designed to compute the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function. The function supports two algorithms: the undetermined coefficients method (default) and Bronstein's full partial fraction decomposition algorithm.\n- **Behavior**: By default, it uses the undetermined coefficients method, which relies on polynomial factorization. This method works over the rational numbers and does not support decomposition of denominators with non-rational roots by default. Bronstein's algorithm, which supports non-rational roots, can be used by setting `full=True`.\n- **Method Overloading**: There's also an `apart` method defined in `sympy/core/expr.py` within the `Expr` class, which essentially redirects to the `apart` function in `sympy.polys`.\n\n### `subs` Method\n- **Multiple Occurrences**: The `subs` method appears in various files across the codebase, including `sympy/core/basic.py`, which likely contains its core implementation for symbolic expressions. This method is crucial for substituting symbols or expressions within another expression.\n\n### `symbols` Class\n- **No Direct Findings**: The search did not find a specific class named `symbols`. This is expected because `symbols` in SymPy is a convenience function for creating symbols, not a class. The actual symbolic objects created by `symbols` are instances of `Symbol` or a subclass thereof, which are part of SymPy's core symbolic expression system.\n\n### Analysis and Next Steps\nGiven the issue description, the problem seems to arise when the `apart` function is applied to a specific symbolic expression. The expected behavior is to correctly decompose the expression into partial fractions, but the output is incorrect under certain conditions.\n\n- **Potential Areas of Concern**:\n  - The handling of symbolic expressions with specific properties (e.g., real=True, negative=False) by the `apart` function.\n  - The interaction between the `subs` method and the `apart` function, especially how substituted expressions are decomposed.\n  - The algorithms used by `apart` (undetermined coefficients method vs. Bronstein's algorithm) and their limitations or bugs.\n\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - **Review the Implementation**: A closer look at the implementation of the `apart` function, especially how it handles expressions with non-rational roots and its interaction with symbolic properties, could reveal potential bugs or limitations.\n  - **Test Cases**: Creating test cases that replicate the issue with minimal examples could help isolate the problem. This involves testing the `apart` function with expressions similar to the one in the issue, both with and without substitutions.\n  - **Algorithm-Specific Behavior**: Investigating how the choice of algorithm (`full=True` vs. `full=False`) affects the outcome for expressions similar to the one in the issue could provide insights into the root cause.\n\nGiven the complexity of symbolic computation and expression manipulation in SymPy, pinpointing the exact cause will require a detailed examination of the `apart` function's logic and its handling of specific types of expressions."

However, to further pinpoint the issue, especially how the `subs` method interacts with expressions before they are passed to `apart`, it might be beneficial to look into the core implementation of `subs` in `sympy/core/basic.py`. This could provide insights into potential mishandling of symbolic expressions or assumptions that `apart` might not be accounting for.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"subs\", \"sympy/core/basic.py\")\n```\n\n- **where are bug locations**:\n\nBased on the information gathered, the bug locations could be in the following files and methods:\n\n1. **Buggy File**: `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n   - **Buggy Method**: `apart`\n     - This method is responsible for the partial fraction decomposition, and the issue arises when it produces incorrect results for certain expressions.\n\n2. **Potential Area for Further Investigation**: `sympy/core/basic.py`\n   - **Method of Interest**: `subs`\n     - While not directly identified as buggy, understanding its implementation is crucial since the issue occurs after substituting symbols in an expression and then applying `apart`. There might be an interaction or a precondition that `apart` is not handling correctly after `subs` is called.\n\nThese locations and methods are the primary candidates for investigating the reported issue, focusing on how expressions are decomposed into partial fractions and how substitutions are handled before decomposition."

        "content": "The collected context from `sympy/core/basic.py` provides a detailed look into the implementation of the `subs` method within the `Basic` class. This method is crucial for substituting one expression with another within a given symbolic expression. Here's an analysis based on the provided implementation details:\n\n### Key Features of `subs` Method:\n- **Substitution Mechanism**: The `subs` method allows for two types of input arguments:\n  1. Two arguments, where the first is the old expression to be replaced, and the second is the new expression to be substituted in.\n  2. A single iterable argument, which can be a container of `(old, new)` pairs, a dictionary, or a set of key/value pairs corresponding to old/new expressions.\n\n- **Simultaneous Substitutions**: An important feature of the `subs` method is the `simultaneous` keyword argument. When set to `True`, it ensures that all substitutions are made simultaneously rather than sequentially. This can affect the outcome significantly, especially in expressions where subsequent substitutions might depend on previous ones.\n\n- **Evaluation Control**: The method provides control over the evaluation of subexpressions during the substitution process. By default, subexpressions are evaluated after each substitution unless `simultaneous=True` is specified.\n\n- **Handling Unordered Iterables**: For unordered iterables (e.g., dictionaries and sets), the method sorts the old/new pairs by operation count, number of arguments, and a default sort key to ensure a canonical result.\n\n### Analysis and Implications for the Issue:\nGiven the issue description, where the `apart` function produces incorrect results after substitution, several aspects of the `subs` method's implementation could be relevant:\n- **Evaluation Timing**: If the issue arises from the way expressions are evaluated during substitution, the use of `simultaneous=True` might alter the outcome. This could be particularly relevant if the expression being substituted affects the structure of the expression in a way that influences how `apart` decomposes it.\n- **Order of Substitutions**: The order in which substitutions are made (especially when not using `simultaneous=True`) could lead to different intermediate expressions, potentially affecting the behavior of `apart`.\n- **Canonical Sorting**: The sorting of unordered iterables might introduce a specific order of substitutions that either exposes or masks the issue.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe `subs` method's implementation provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for expression substitution, with features that can significantly influence the outcome of subsequent operations like `apart`. To further investigate the issue, it would be essential to consider how the specifics of the `subs` method (especially the `simultaneous` argument) interact with the expression and the `apart` function. Experimenting with different substitution strategies (sequential vs. simultaneous) and carefully analyzing the intermediate expressions could help isolate the cause of the incorrect results observed with `apart`."

The function's algorithm for partial fraction decomposition might not be accounting for certain properties of the substituted expressions correctly.\n\n2. **Related Area for Investigation**: `sympy/core/basic.py`\n   - **Related Method**: `subs`\n     - While not directly buggy, the behavior and features of the `subs` method, especially the handling of simultaneous substitutions and the evaluation of subexpressions, are crucial for understanding the context in which the `apart` function fails. The interaction between `subs` and `apart` should be carefully reviewed to identify if the issue arises from the way substitutions are performed or applied before calling `apart`.\n\nThese locations and methods are central to investigating the reported issue, focusing on the interaction between substitution and partial fraction decomposition in symbolic expressions."

This may not reflect the\n        limiting behavior of the expression:\n\n        >>> (x**3 - 3*x).subs({x: oo})\n        nan\n\n        >>> limit(x**3 - 3*x, x, oo)\n        oo\n\n        If the substitution will be followed by numerical\n        evaluation, it is better to pass the substitution to\n        evalf as\n\n        >>> (1/x).evalf(subs={x: 3.0}, n=21)\n        0.333333333333333333333\n\n        rather than\n\n        >>> (1/x).subs({x: 3.0}).evalf(21)\n        0.333333333333333314830\n\n        as the former will ensure that the desired level of precision is\n        obtained.\n\n        See Also\n        ========\n        replace: replacement capable of doing wildcard-like matching,\n                 parsing of match, and conditional replacements\n        xreplace: exact node replacement in expr tree; also capable of\n                  using matching rules\n        evalf: calculates the given formula to a desired level of precision\n\n        \"\"\"\n        from sympy.core.containers import Dict\n        from sympy.utilities import default_sort_key\n        from sympy import Dummy, Symbol\n\n        unordered = False\n        if len(args) == 1:\n            sequence = args[0]\n            if isinstance(sequence, set):\n                unordered = True\n            elif isinstance(sequence, (Dict, Mapping)):\n                unordered = True\n                sequence = sequence.items()\n            elif not iterable(sequence):\n                from sympy.utilities.misc import filldedent\n                raise ValueError(filldedent(\"\"\"\n                   When a single argument is passed to subs\n                   it should be a dictionary of old: new pairs or an iterable\n                   of (old, new) tuples.\"\"\"))\n        elif len(args) == 2:\n            sequence = [args]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"subs accepts either 1 or 2 arguments\")\n\n        sequence = list(sequence)\n        for i in range(len(sequence)):\n            s = list(sequence[i])\n            for j, si in enumerate(s):\n                try:\n                    si = sympify(si, strict=True)\n                except SympifyError:\n                    if type(si) is str:\n                        si = Symbol(si)\n                    else:\n                        # if it can't be sympified, skip it\n                        sequence[i] = None\n                        break\n                s[j] = si\n            else:\n                sequence[i] = None if _aresame(*s) else tuple(s)\n        sequence = list(filter(None, sequence))\n\n        if unordered:\n            sequence = dict(sequence)\n            if not all(k.is_Atom for k in sequence):\n                d = {}\n                for o, n in sequence.items():\n                    try:\n                        ops = o.count_ops(), len(o.args)\n                    except TypeError:\n                        ops = (0, 0)\n                    d.setdefault(ops, []).append((o, n))\n                newseq = []\n                for k in sorted(d.keys(), reverse=True):\n                    newseq.extend(\n                        sorted([v[0] for v in d[k]], key=default_sort_key))\n                sequence = [(k, sequence[k]) for k in newseq]\n                del newseq, d\n            else:\n                sequence = sorted([(k, v) for (k, v) in sequence.items()],\n                                  key=default_sort_key)\n\n        if kwargs.pop('simultaneous', False):  # XXX should this be the default for dict subs?\n            reps = {}\n            rv = self\n            kwargs['hack2'] = True\n            m = Dummy()\n            for old, new in sequence:\n                d = Dummy(commutative=new.is_commutative)\n                # using d*m so Subs will be used on dummy variables\n                # in things like Derivative(f(x, y), x) in which x\n                # is both free and bound\n                rv = rv._subs(old, d*m, **kwargs)\n                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):\n                    break\n                reps[d] = new\n            reps[m] = S.One  # get rid of m\n            return rv.xreplace(reps)\n        else:\n            rv = self\n            for old, new in sequence:\n                rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)\n                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):\n                    break\n            return rv\n</code>\n\n\n"
