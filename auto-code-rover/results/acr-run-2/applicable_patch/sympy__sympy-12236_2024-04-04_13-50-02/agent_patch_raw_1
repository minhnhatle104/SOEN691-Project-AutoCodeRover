Given the context and the nature of the issue, it's challenging to propose a specific patch without a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical operations and the intended behavior of both the `apart` and `subs` functions. However, I can suggest a general approach that might address potential issues in the interaction between these functions, particularly focusing on ensuring that substitutions are correctly applied and recognized by the `apart` function.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/polys/partfrac.py</file>
<original>if f.is_Atom:
    return f
else:
    P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()</original>
<patched>if f.is_Atom:
    return f
else:
    # Ensure f is simplified before decomposition, to handle substitutions correctly
    f = f.simplify()
    P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()</patched>
```
This modification ensures that the expression `f` is simplified before attempting to decompose it into partial fractions. This step might help in cases where substitutions lead to expressions that could be further simplified to a form that `apart` can handle more effectively.

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/core/basic.py</file>
<original>if kwargs.pop('simultaneous', False):  # XXX should this be the default for dict subs?
    reps = {}
    rv = self
    kwargs['hack2'] = True
    m = Dummy()
    for old, new in sequence:
        d = Dummy(commutative=new.is_commutative)
        rv = rv._subs(old, d*m, **kwargs)
        if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
            break
        reps[d] = new
    reps[m] = S.One  # get rid of m
    return rv.xreplace(reps)</original>
<patched>if kwargs.pop('simultaneous', False):  # Consider making this the default for dict subs to ensure consistent behavior
    reps = {}
    rv = self
    kwargs['hack2'] = True
    m = Dummy()
    for old, new in sequence:
        d = Dummy(commutative=new.is_commutative)
        # Apply simplification after each substitution to ensure expressions are in their simplest form
        rv = rv._subs(old, d*m, **kwargs).simplify()
        if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
            break
        reps[d] = new
    reps[m] = S.One  # get rid of m
    return rv.xreplace(reps).simplify()</patched>
```
This modification introduces simplification steps after substitutions are made, especially when `simultaneous=True` is used. This ensures that the resulting expression is in its simplest form, potentially making it easier for the `apart` function to process.

Please note, these modifications are speculative and aimed at addressing potential issues based on the provided context. Actual implementation and testing would be necessary to validate these changes and ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new ones.
