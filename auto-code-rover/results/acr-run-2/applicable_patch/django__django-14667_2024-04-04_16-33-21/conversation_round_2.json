If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n</issue>"

Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that these methods are part of a larger QuerySet class, which is a common pattern in ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) such as Django's ORM. The issue suggests a problem with the way deferred fields are handled when both `defer()` and `only()` are used in a chain. To start, we'll look into the definitions and implementations of these methods.\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(method_name: \"defer\", class_name: \"QuerySet\")`: This will help us understand how the `defer()` method is implemented within the QuerySet class.\n2. `search_method_in_class(method_name: \"only\", class_name: \"QuerySet\")`: This will give us insights into the implementation of the `only()` method and how it's supposed to work in conjunction with `defer()`.\n3. `search_class(class_name: \"QuerySet\")`: By searching for the QuerySet class itself, we can get a broader view of how defer and only are supposed to interact with other methods and possibly find related methods that affect their behavior.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue and formulating a solution."

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the `QuerySet` class and the specific methods `defer()` and `only()`, we can start to analyze the issue and think about potential solutions.\n\n### Analysis of `defer()` Method\nThe `defer()` method is designed to defer the loading of specified fields until they are accessed. The method adds the set of deferred fields to any existing set of deferred fields, with a special case where passing `None` as the only parameter clears all deferrals. The implementation checks for combined queries and usage after `.values()` or `.values_list()`, raising a `TypeError` if either condition is met. It then either clears deferred loading or adds to the deferred loading set based on the input.\n\n### Analysis of `only()` Method\nThe `only()` method functions as the opposite of `defer()`, specifying that only the fields passed into this method (and not already deferred) are loaded immediately when the queryset is evaluated. Similar to `defer()`, it checks for combined queries and usage after `.values()` or `.values_list()`, raising errors if those conditions are met. It also has special handling for `None` and `FilteredRelation`.\n\n### Identified Issue\nThe issue at hand is that chaining `.defer()` after `.only()` does not behave as expected. Specifically, when `.defer()` is used to defer a field that was previously specified in `.only()`, the expected behavior would be to adjust the set of fields to be loaded immediately, effectively negating the effect of `.only()` for that field. However, the described behavior suggests that `.defer()` does not modify the set of fields to be loaded as expected when used after `.only()`.\n\n### Potential Solution Direction\nGiven the descriptions of `defer()` and `only()`, a solution would likely involve adjusting how these methods interact with each other, particularly in how they modify the queryset's state regarding deferred and immediately loaded fields. A few areas to consider are:\n- **QuerySet State Management**: Ensure that the state of the queryset (specifically, the sets of deferred and immediately loaded fields) is correctly managed when chaining `defer()` and `only()`.\n- **Interaction Between `defer()` and `only()`**: It may be necessary to adjust the logic in either or both methods to correctly handle the case where they are used in conjunction. This could involve checking the current state of deferred and immediate fields and making appropriate adjustments when fields are specified in `defer()` that were previously included in `only()`.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo proceed with a solution, we would need to dive deeper into the logic of how deferred and immediate fields are tracked and modified within the `QuerySet` class. This would likely involve looking at the `query` attribute of the `QuerySet` instance, particularly methods like `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()`, and ensuring they correctly handle the interaction between deferred and immediate fields."
