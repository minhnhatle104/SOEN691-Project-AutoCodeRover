```python
<file>django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py</file>
<original>                return Message(*obj[2:])</original>
<patched>                # Adjust to handle extra_tags correctly when reconstructing Message
                # If the length of obj is less than expected due to missing extra_tags, append an empty string for extra_tags
                if len(obj) < 6:
                    obj.append("")
                return Message(*obj[2:])</patched>
```

These modifications address the issue by ensuring that `extra_tags` is always included in the serialized data, even if it's an empty string, and correctly reconstructing `Message` objects with `extra_tags` as an empty string if it was omitted during serialization.
