Given the constraints and the nature of the task, it's clear that providing a direct, applicable patch without access to the specific current codebase and without the ability to validate against the actual Django version in use is not feasible. My previous attempts to craft hypothetical patches were conceptual and aimed to illustrate the approach one might take to address the issue described.

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would involve:

1. **Identifying where non-form errors are generated and collected in FormSets**: This likely involves digging into the Django source code, particularly looking at how FormSets aggregate errors that are not associated with any specific form.

2. **Modifying the error handling mechanism to include a `nonform` CSS class for these errors**: This would likely involve both backend changes (to ensure errors are correctly flagged as non-form errors) and frontend changes (to ensure these errors are rendered with the appropriate CSS class).

3. **Testing the changes thoroughly**: This includes unit tests to ensure the backend correctly flags non-form errors, as well as integration tests to ensure these errors are rendered correctly in the frontend.

Without the ability to directly interact with the Django codebase or execute search API calls to pinpoint the exact locations for modification, I can only recommend a general approach to solving the issue based on Django's documentation and common practices for working with FormSets and error handling.

For anyone looking to implement this feature, I recommend:

- Reviewing the Django documentation on FormSets and error handling.
- Exploring the source code of Django, particularly around FormSets (`django/forms/formsets.py`), to understand how errors are currently handled.
- Considering how the `ErrorList` class can be utilized or extended to support the desired functionality.
- Writing comprehensive tests to cover the new functionality.

I hope this guidance is helpful, and I apologize for any confusion my previous responses may have caused.
