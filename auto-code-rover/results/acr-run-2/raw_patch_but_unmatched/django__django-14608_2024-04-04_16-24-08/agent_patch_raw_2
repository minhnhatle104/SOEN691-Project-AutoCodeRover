Given the constraints and the nature of the task, without direct access to the current Django codebase and specific line numbers or exact code snippets, creating a perfectly matching patch is challenging. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to how one might go about implementing the requested feature based on common Django patterns and practices. This conceptual approach should be adapted to fit the actual codebase by a developer with access to the specific versions and files in question.

### Conceptual Patch for Adding `nonform` CSS Class to Non-Form Errors in FormSets

#### Modification 1: Update Error Handling in FormSets
File: `django/forms/formsets.py` (Hypothetical location)

Since the exact original code cannot be matched, a conceptual update is proposed where non-form errors are handled in a FormSet. This involves ensuring that non-form errors are wrapped in an `ErrorList` instance with a custom CSS class.

```python
# Conceptual Patch
class BaseFormSet:
    # Assuming there's a method that collects non-form errors
    def non_form_errors(self):
        # Wrap non-form errors in ErrorList with 'nonform' CSS class
        errors = super().non_form_errors()  # Hypothetical call to the original method
        return ErrorList(errors, error_class='nonform')
```

#### Modification 2: Ensure `ErrorList` Supports Custom CSS Classes
File: `django/forms/utils.py`

This modification ensures that the `ErrorList` class can accept and utilize a custom CSS class when rendering errors. This is a conceptual approach assuming `ErrorList` does not already support this functionality.

```python
class ErrorList(UserList, list):
    def __init__(self, initlist=None, error_class='errorlist'):
        super().__init__(initlist)
        self.error_class = error_class  # Added to support custom CSS classes

    # Update rendering methods to use self.error_class
    def as_ul(self):
        if not self:
            return ''
        return format_html('<ul class="{}">{}</ul>',
                           self.error_class,
                           format_html_join('', '<li>{}</li>', ((force_text(e),) for e in self)))
```

#### Modification 3: Adjust Templates to Use New CSS Class
File: `django/forms/templates/django/forms/formsets/non_form_errors.html` (Hypothetical location)

This modification assumes there's a specific template for rendering non-form errors in FormSets. The template should be updated to utilize the new CSS class.

```html
{% if formset.non_form_errors %}
    <ul class="{{ formset.non_form_errors.error_class }}">
        {% for error in formset.non_form_errors %}
            <li>{{ error }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endif %}
```

### Note:
These modifications are conceptual and based on common Django patterns. Actual implementation may vary depending on the Django version and project structure. Developers should adjust the code to fit the specific context of their Django application, ensuring compatibility with the existing codebase.
