Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it appears that providing a direct patch without access to the specific implementation details or the ability to validate against the actual codebase is not feasible. The guidance provided was intended to illustrate a conceptual approach to resolving the type discrepancy issue with Django's `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices` based on common Django patterns and practices.

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue would typically involve reviewing the specific model and field definitions, understanding how the enum values are being set and retrieved, and ensuring that any custom model methods or field behaviors are correctly implemented according to Django's documentation and best practices.

Without the ability to directly match the guidance to the original program's code structure and without further details on the implementation, I recommend the following steps to address the issue:

1. **Review Django Documentation**: Ensure that the usage of `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices` aligns with the recommendations and examples provided in the Django documentation for the version of Django being used.

2. **Examine Model Definitions**: Closely review the model definitions, especially the fields using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`, to ensure they are defined correctly. Pay special attention to any custom methods or behaviors that might affect how field values are set or retrieved.

3. **Debug and Test**: Utilize Django's debugging tools and write unit tests to closely examine the behavior of the fields in question. Tests should cover creating new instances, saving them to the database, retrieving instances from the database, and accessing the field values to ensure they return the expected type and value.

4. **Consult Django Community Resources**: If the issue persists, consider seeking advice from the Django community through forums, Q&A sites like Stack Overflow, or the Django Users mailing list. Often, issues like these have been encountered and addressed by others in the community.

I apologize for any confusion and hope these steps provide a pathway toward resolving the issue.
