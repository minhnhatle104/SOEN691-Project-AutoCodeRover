        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the Django model field values, particularly those using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`, are being handled when instances of models are created and retrieved from the database. The issue points out a discrepancy in the type of value returned by the getter of a field that uses `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`. Specifically, it seems that the value is being returned as an enum member rather than the expected string or integer value.\n\nGiven this context, we should look into the implementation of the model field's getter method to see how it handles values of fields defined with choices. Additionally, understanding how Django's ORM handles the serialization and deserialization of these choice fields could provide insight into the root cause of the issue.\n\nLet's start by investigating the following:\n\n1. How the `CharField` (and by extension, `IntegerField`) handles the `choices` parameter, particularly when those choices are defined using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`.\n2. The implementation of the `__str__` method for the model, if it's being overridden or relies on Django's default behavior.\n3. Any custom methods or signals that might be affecting the serialization or deserialization process of model instances.\n\nBased on these points, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. `search_class(\"MyObject\")`: To get more context on the `MyObject` model class and see if there's any custom implementation affecting the issue.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"MyObject\")`: To check if the `MyObject` class has a custom `__str__` method that might be affecting the representation of the `my_str_value` field.\n3. `search_method(\"get_FOO_display\")`: Since Django automatically creates a `get_FOO_display()` method for fields with choices, searching for this method could help understand how Django handles the display of choice fields.\n4. `search_code(\"my_str_value = models.CharField\")`: To find the declaration of the `my_str_value` field in the codebase and see if there's any additional context or customization around its usage.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."

It includes a `parent` field that is a `ForeignKey` to itself, allowing a hierarchical structure. This is not directly related to the issue but gives us context about the model's complexity.\n   - The `data` field is a `CharField` with a maximum length of 100. This field is different from the `my_str_value` field mentioned in the issue, indicating that the specific field in question (`my_str_value`) might not be directly defined within the `MyObject` class or the search might have missed it due to limitations or inaccuracies.\n   - A `created_at` field is present, which is a `DateTimeField` with `auto_now_add=True`, automatically setting the field to the current date and time when a new record is created. This is standard for models tracking creation timestamps but unrelated to the issue.\n\n2. **Absence of a Custom `__str__` Method**:\n   - The search did not find a custom `__str__` method within the `MyObject` class. This means the class relies on Django's default string representation for models, which does not directly address the issue of how choice field values are represented as strings.\n\n3. **Lack of `get_FOO_display` Method**:\n   - The inability to find the `get_FOO_display` method in the codebase is surprising, as Django automatically generates this method for fields with choices to get the human-readable name for the value. This could indicate a limitation in the search or a misunderstanding of the method's availability in the project's Django version.\n\n4. **Missing `my_str_value` Field Definition**:\n   - The search did not find the definition of the `my_str_value` field in the codebase. This could be due to the field being dynamically defined, the search not covering the relevant files, or inaccuracies in the search parameters.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around understanding how Django handles the serialization and deserialization of choice fields, particularly when those choices are defined using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`, and ensuring that the field values are correctly represented as strings when accessed.\n\nSince the direct searches did not yield results for the specific field and methods related to the issue, we might need to explore alternative approaches to diagnose and address the problem. This could involve reviewing Django's documentation on models and fields with choices, examining how choice fields are defined and used in other parts of the codebase, or manually inspecting the relevant model and field definitions in the `tests/queries/models.py` file and related files."

This could mean that the `MyChoice` class is defined in a different file, or there was an issue with the search parameters. Given the issue description, `MyChoice` is crucial for understanding how choices are defined in relation to the bug.\n\n2. **Usage of `models.TextChoices`**:\n   - The search found 7 snippets containing `models.TextChoices` across various test files. Notably, `tests/model_enums/tests.py` contains 4 matches, which could be particularly relevant since it might include tests or examples that closely relate to the issue at hand. This suggests that the usage of `TextChoices` is widespread in the codebase, and examining these occurrences could provide insight into standard practices or potential misuses within the project.\n\n3. **Usage of `models.IntegerField(choices=)`**:\n   - There are 16 snippets across multiple files, indicating that integer fields with choices are also commonly used in the project. Similar to `TextChoices`, examining these usages, especially in files like `tests/model_fields/models.py` which contains 5 matches, could reveal patterns or issues related to the handling of choice fields.\n\n4. **Occurrences of the `save` Method**:\n   - With 36 methods named `save` found in the codebase, it's clear that there are many custom implementations of the `save` method. Since the `save` method can affect how model instances are stored and retrieved, any custom logic in these implementations could potentially impact the handling of choice fields. The occurrence in `django/db/models/base.py` is particularly noteworthy as it likely represents the base implementation of the `save` method for Django models.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around the handling of choice fields (`TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`) and their representation when model instances are created and retrieved. The absence of `MyChoice` in the expected file and the widespread use of choice fields across the codebase suggest that the issue might not be isolated to a specific implementation but could relate to a broader misunderstanding or misuse of Django's choice fields.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, it would be beneficial to review the implementations found in `tests/model_enums/tests.py` for `TextChoices` and in `tests/model_fields/models.py` for `IntegerField` with choices. These files are likely to contain relevant examples or tests that mirror the issue described. Additionally, reviewing the base implementation of the `save` method in `django/db/models/base.py` could provide insights into how model instances are saved and whether there might be any implications for choice fields.\n\nIn summary, while we have not pinpointed the exact location of the bug, the collected context suggests that the issue might be related to a broader pattern of handling choice fields within the project. Further investigation into the mentioned files and their handling of choice fields is warranted."

Let's analyze these findings:\n\n1. **Usage of `models.TextChoices` in `tests/model_enums/tests.py`**:\n   - The presence of `models.TextChoices` in both function-based tests (`test_textchoices_functional_api` and `test_textchoices_blank_value`) and outside any function suggests a comprehensive testing approach for `TextChoices`. The tests likely cover various aspects of using `TextChoices`, including functional API usage and handling blank values.\n   - The specific tests mentioned could provide insight into the intended usage patterns and potential pitfalls when working with `TextChoices`. This could be directly relevant to the issue, especially if the problem stems from a misunderstanding of how `TextChoices` should be used or how they interact with model fields.\n\n2. **Usage of `models.IntegerField(choices=)` in `tests/model_fields/models.py`**:\n   - The snippets found outside any function indicate that `IntegerField` with choices is likely used in model definitions within this file. This aligns with standard Django practice and suggests that these models serve as examples or test cases for using integer fields with choices.\n   - Given the issue's description, examining these model definitions could reveal whether there's a consistent approach to defining and using choice fields across the project and if any of these approaches could lead to the type discrepancy described in the issue.\n\n3. **Implementation of the `save` Method in `django/db/models/base.py`**:\n   - The `save` method and related methods (`save_base`, `_save_parents`, `_save_table`, `_do_update`, and `prepare_database_save`) form the core logic for saving Django model instances to the database. The multiple matches for `save` and `save_base` suggest complex logic that handles various aspects of the save operation, including dealing with parent models, saving specific tables, and updating existing records.\n   - The complexity of these methods means that any custom behavior related to choice fields (either in saving or preparing data for the database) would likely be handled here or in overridden versions of these methods in child classes. Understanding this core logic is crucial for diagnosing issues related to how model field values are stored and retrieved.\n\nBased on this analysis, the issue likely stems from either a misunderstanding of how to properly use `TextChoices` and `IntegerField` with choices in model definitions or a subtlety in how Django's `save` method logic handles these fields. The tests in `tests/model_enums/tests.py` could provide valuable examples of correct usage or illustrate potential issues with `TextChoices`. Similarly, the model definitions in `tests/model_fields/models.py` might reveal patterns or practices that could lead to the observed issue. Finally, the implementation details of the `save` method and related functions in `django/db/models/base.py` are critical for understanding the underlying mechanics of saving model instances, which could affect the handling of choice fields.\n\nTo address the issue, one should review the mentioned tests and model definitions for insights into correct usage patterns and potential pitfalls. Additionally, reviewing the `save` method's implementation could reveal if there are specific considerations or custom logic for handling choice fields that could lead to the type discrepancy described in the issue."

Instead of returning a primitive type (string or integer), the field returns an enum member. This behavior is unexpected and problematic, especially when interfacing with external systems that expect a primitive type.\n\n### Analysis Based on Search Results\n- The search results did not directly identify the `MyChoice` class or the `my_str_value` field within the expected files, suggesting that the issue might not be with the specific instances of these elements but could be a more systemic issue related to how `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices` are used or understood within the project.\n- The absence of a custom `__str__` method in the `MyObject` class and the lack of a `get_FOO_display` method in the codebase point towards a potential gap in handling or representing enum values as strings.\n- The searches related to `models.TextChoices`, `models.IntegerField(choices=)`, and the `save` method across various files indicate widespread use of these features but did not pinpoint a specific misuse or misconfiguration that could lead to the described issue.\n\n### Potential Areas for Further Investigation\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the issue, further investigation should focus on:\n- **Understanding Django's Expected Behavior**: Ensure clarity on how Django expects `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices` to be used with model fields, particularly regarding value retrieval and representation. This involves reviewing the Django documentation for the version being used.\n- **Reviewing Enum and Field Definitions**: Examine how enums are defined and used across the project, with a focus on any patterns that might deviate from Django's expected practices.\n- **Examining Model Save and Retrieve Logic**: Since the issue manifests upon retrieving the model instance from the database, reviewing the custom logic in model save operations, signals, or overrides that might affect how values are stored and retrieved could be crucial.\n\n### Conclusion\nWithout the ability to perform new searches or access more detailed information from the codebase, this analysis suggests a broad approach to diagnosing and potentially resolving the issue. The problem seems to stem from a misunderstanding or misuse of Django's `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`, requiring a careful review of how these are implemented within the project and ensuring alignment with Django's documentation and best practices."

Since the specific locations and implementations of the problematic code are not provided, I'll propose a generic patch that could address the described issue within a Django model definition context.\n\n### Assumed Problematic Code\nThe issue seems to stem from the model's field value returning the enum member directly, which suggests that the retrieval or interpretation of the field's value does not convert the enum member to its corresponding primitive value.\n\n### Proposed Patch\nThe patch will ensure that when the model field value is accessed, it returns the expected primitive value (the `.value` of the enum member) instead of the enum member itself. This can be achieved by overriding the `__get__` method of the field descriptor or by ensuring proper use of the `get_FOO_display` method provided by Django for fields with choices.\n\nSince the exact implementation details are not provided, below are hypothetical patches that could be applied:\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>models.py</file>\n<original>\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n\nclass MyChoice(models.TextChoices):\n    FIRST_CHOICE = \"first\", _(\"The first choice, it is\")\n    SECOND_CHOICE = \"second\", _(\"The second choice, it is\")\n\nclass MyObject(models.Model):\n    my_str_value = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=MyChoice.choices)\n</original>\n<patched>\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n\nclass MyChoice(models.TextChoices):\n    FIRST_CHOICE = \"first\", _(\"The first choice, it is\")\n    SECOND_CHOICE = \"second\", _(\"The second choice, it is\")\n\nclass MyObject(models.Model):\n    my_str_value = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=MyChoice.choices)\n\n    def get_my_str_value_display(self):\n        # Override to ensure the primitive value is returned\n        value = getattr(self, \"my_str_value\", None)\n        return MyChoice(value).label if value else None\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis modification assumes that the issue is with how the choice field's value is retrieved and displayed. By overriding or ensuring the correct implementation of a method similar to `get_my_str_value_display`, we can explicitly control the output to match the expected primitive value.\n\nPlease note, the provided patch is hypothetical and based on the assumption of the issue's nature. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific details of the codebase and Django's version."

However, I'll offer a conceptual solution that addresses the common cause of such issues in Django models when dealing with `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`. This solution is based on ensuring that the model field correctly handles the enum values.\n\n### Conceptual Patch for Handling `TextChoices` in Django Models\n\nThe issue described involves a Django model field that, when accessed, returns an enum member object instead of the expected primitive value (string or integer). This behavior can lead to inconsistencies, especially when interfacing with external systems expecting a primitive value.\n\nA common approach to ensure the field returns the expected primitive value is to use the `get_FOO_display()` method provided by Django for fields defined with choices. This method is automatically generated by Django and is intended to return the display value of the choice.\n\nHowever, if the goal is to ensure that the model's field itself returns the primitive value directly, one might consider customizing the model's save or initialization methods to store the choice's value in the desired format. Below is a conceptual approach to modifying the model to ensure the field stores and returns the primitive value directly.\n\n### Hypothetical Patch\n\n```python\n<file>app/models.py</file>\n<original>\nclass MyChoice(models.TextChoices):\n    FIRST_CHOICE = \"first\", _(\"The first choice, it is\")\n    SECOND_CHOICE = \"second\", _(\"The second choice, it is\")\n\nclass MyObject(models.Model):\n    my_str_value = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=MyChoice.choices)\n</original>\n<patched>\nclass MyChoice(models.TextChoices):\n    FIRST_CHOICE = \"first\", _(\"The first choice, it is\")\n    SECOND_CHOICE = \"second\", _(\"The second choice, it is\")\n\nclass MyObject(models.Model):\n    my_str_value = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=MyChoice.choices)\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if isinstance(self.my_str_value, MyChoice):\n            self.my_str_value = self.my_str_value.value\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        if self.my_str_value in MyChoice.__members__:\n            self.my_str_value = MyChoice[self.my_str_value].value\n</patched>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `save` method is overridden to check if `my_str_value` is an instance of `MyChoice` enum and, if so, store its `.value` attribute instead of the enum member itself. This ensures that the database stores the primitive value.\n- The `__init__` method is overridden to convert `my_str_value` from an enum member to its primitive value upon model instantiation. This is useful when models are retrieved from the database and ensures consistency in how the field's value is represented within the application.\n\n### Note\n\nThis patch is conceptual and might require adjustments to fit the specific details of your Django project, including the version of Django you are using and the exact nature of the issue you're encountering. Always test changes in a development environment before applying them to your production codebase."
