Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the original program and specific details about the implementation, providing a precise patch is challenging. However, I'll offer a conceptual solution that addresses the common cause of such issues in Django models when dealing with `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`. This solution is based on ensuring that the model field correctly handles the enum values.

### Conceptual Patch for Handling `TextChoices` in Django Models

The issue described involves a Django model field that, when accessed, returns an enum member object instead of the expected primitive value (string or integer). This behavior can lead to inconsistencies, especially when interfacing with external systems expecting a primitive value.

A common approach to ensure the field returns the expected primitive value is to use the `get_FOO_display()` method provided by Django for fields defined with choices. This method is automatically generated by Django and is intended to return the display value of the choice.

However, if the goal is to ensure that the model's field itself returns the primitive value directly, one might consider customizing the model's save or initialization methods to store the choice's value in the desired format. Below is a conceptual approach to modifying the model to ensure the field stores and returns the primitive value directly.

### Hypothetical Patch

```python
<file>app/models.py</file>
<original>
class MyChoice(models.TextChoices):
    FIRST_CHOICE = "first", _("The first choice, it is")
    SECOND_CHOICE = "second", _("The second choice, it is")

class MyObject(models.Model):
    my_str_value = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=MyChoice.choices)
</original>
<patched>
class MyChoice(models.TextChoices):
    FIRST_CHOICE = "first", _("The first choice, it is")
    SECOND_CHOICE = "second", _("The second choice, it is")

class MyObject(models.Model):
    my_str_value = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=MyChoice.choices)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if isinstance(self.my_str_value, MyChoice):
            self.my_str_value = self.my_str_value.value
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        if self.my_str_value in MyChoice.__members__:
            self.my_str_value = MyChoice[self.my_str_value].value
</patched>
```

### Explanation

- The `save` method is overridden to check if `my_str_value` is an instance of `MyChoice` enum and, if so, store its `.value` attribute instead of the enum member itself. This ensures that the database stores the primitive value.
- The `__init__` method is overridden to convert `my_str_value` from an enum member to its primitive value upon model instantiation. This is useful when models are retrieved from the database and ensures consistency in how the field's value is represented within the application.

### Note

This patch is conceptual and might require adjustments to fit the specific details of your Django project, including the version of Django you are using and the exact nature of the issue you're encountering. Always test changes in a development environment before applying them to your production codebase.
