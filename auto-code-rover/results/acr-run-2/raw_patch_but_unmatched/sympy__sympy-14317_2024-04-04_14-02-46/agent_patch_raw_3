Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be accurately formulated without more precise details from the actual implementation of the `LatexPrinter` class and its handling of `Poly` objects. The issue revolves around the internal logic for ordering monomials in the LaTeX representation, which is not directly exposed through the `doprint` method or the brief snippets provided.

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would involve a detailed review of the `LatexPrinter` class's implementation, specifically focusing on how it interprets and renders `Poly` objects. The goal would be to ensure that the monomial ordering logic aligns with that used by the `pretty` and `str` methods, likely requiring adjustments to the method(s) responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of polynomials.

Without the ability to propose a specific code patch under these circumstances, the best course of action would be to document the findings and recommend a review of the `LatexPrinter` class by someone with full access to the codebase and the ability to test changes directly. This review should focus on the consistency of monomial ordering across different representation methods (`latex`, `pretty`, `str`) for `Poly` objects.

I appreciate your understanding of the limitations in providing a direct patch under the current setup.
