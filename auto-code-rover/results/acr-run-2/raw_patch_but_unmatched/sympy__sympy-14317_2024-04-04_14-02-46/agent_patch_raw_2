Given the limitations in directly identifying and modifying the exact location within the `LatexPrinter` class that handles the ordering of `Poly` objects for LaTeX conversion, and based on the provided context, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without more specific details on the implementation.

The conceptual approach to resolving the issue would involve ensuring that the terms of the `Poly` object are correctly ordered before they are converted into a LaTeX string. This would likely involve modifying the part of the `LatexPrinter` class or related utility functions that handle the conversion of `Poly` objects to LaTeX, ensuring that the terms are sorted according to their degrees in a consistent manner with how `pretty` and `str` representations are generated.

Since a direct patch cannot be provided without further details, the recommended next steps for someone with access to the codebase would be:

1. Identify the method within the `LatexPrinter` class or related utility functions that is responsible for converting `Poly` objects into LaTeX strings. This method would handle the representation of the polynomial terms.

2. Within this method, implement a sorting mechanism for the terms of the `Poly` object based on their degrees, ensuring that the highest degree terms are listed first. This sorting should respect the order used in other representations (`pretty`, `str`).

3. Ensure that any settings related to term ordering (if present) are consistently applied across different representations to maintain uniformity in the output.

Without the ability to directly view and modify the relevant sections of the code, these steps outline a high-level approach to addressing the reported issue.
