Given the context and the nature of the issue, it appears that the core problem does not lie directly within the `doprint` method of the `LatexPrinter` class, but rather in how the `LatexPrinter` processes `Poly` objects before reaching this point. The `doprint` method shown handles the final formatting based on the mode settings but does not directly influence the ordering of monomials in a polynomial expression.

The issue likely resides in the part of the code where the `Poly` object is converted into its LaTeX string representation, specifically how the terms of the polynomial are ordered. Since the `doprint` method and the provided context do not directly reveal where this ordering is handled, a hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that the terms of the `Poly` object are sorted in a consistent manner before being converted into a LaTeX string.

Without direct access to the specific method that handles the ordering of polynomial terms for LaTeX conversion, I can provide a conceptual patch that outlines the approach to ensure consistent ordering:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>
# This is a conceptual representation and may not match the exact code structure.
def _print_Poly(self, expr):
    terms = [...]  # This line is a placeholder for how terms are currently processed.
</original>
<patched>
from sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key

def _print_Poly(self, expr):
    # Sort the terms of the polynomial based on their monomial order.
    # This ensures consistency with pretty and str printing.
    # The 'monomial_key' function is used to obtain a sorting key for each term,
    # which is based on the specified monomial ordering (e.g., lexicographic).
    order = self._settings.get('order', 'lex')
    terms = sorted(expr.terms(), key=monomial_key(order=order, gens=expr.gens))
    # Proceed with the conversion of sorted terms to LaTeX string.
</patched>
```

This modification assumes the existence of a method responsible for handling `Poly` objects within the `LatexPrinter` class, which may not directly match the actual implementation. The key idea is to sort the terms of the polynomial using a consistent ordering (e.g., lexicographic) before converting them into a LaTeX string. This approach aligns the LaTeX representation with the logical order used in `pretty` and `str` representations.

Please note, to implement an actual fix, one would need to identify the precise location in the code where polynomial terms are processed for LaTeX conversion and apply a sorting mechanism similar to the one described above.
