Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be formulated without more specific details on the implementation of the pretty printing functionality, particularly the `PrettyPrinter` class and its `doprint` method. The issue with rendering `pi**(1/E)` accurately in the pretty print format likely stems from deeper within the logic that handles mathematical expressions and their formatting, which isn't directly visible in the provided snippet.

Without access to the specific implementation details or the ability to directly modify the relevant parts of the code, it's not possible to provide a concrete patch. The resolution of the issue would require a thorough review and potentially significant modifications to the parts of the codebase responsible for the parsing and rendering of expressions for pretty printing. This might involve adjusting how symbolic constants and mathematical operations are interpreted and displayed, ensuring that expressions like `pi**(1/E)` are handled correctly according to mathematical notation standards.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Implementation:** Delving into the `PrettyPrinter` class, especially methods involved in rendering expressions, to understand how `pi`, `E`, and the exponentiation operation are handled.
2. **Identifying the Bug:** Locating the exact point in the code where `pi**(1/E)` is incorrectly interpreted or rendered, which could involve tracing through the handling of constants and operations.
3. **Implementing a Fix:** Modifying the logic to ensure that expressions involving constants and exponentiation are accurately represented. This could involve adjusting how the expression tree is traversed and rendered.

Since a specific patch cannot be provided without further details, the focus should be on these steps to guide the debugging and resolution process.
