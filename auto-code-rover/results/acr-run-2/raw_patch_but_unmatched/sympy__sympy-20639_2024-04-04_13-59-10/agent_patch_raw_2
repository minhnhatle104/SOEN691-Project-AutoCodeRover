Given the limitations of the provided context and the absence of specific implementation details for the `PrettyPrinter` class or the `doprint` method, it's challenging to provide a precise patch without access to the actual implementation that handles the rendering of expressions like `pi**(1/E)`. The provided `pretty` function primarily sets up the pretty printing environment and delegates the actual printing to the `pp.doprint(expr)` call, without direct manipulation of mathematical expressions.

Without specific details on how expressions are parsed and rendered, any attempt to patch the code would be speculative. Typically, the handling of expressions like `pi**(1/E)` would involve parsing the expression tree, identifying constants and operations, and then rendering them according to the rules defined for pretty printing. The issue likely lies in how the exponentiation operation is handled, especially with symbolic constants.

A more effective approach would involve examining the `PrettyPrinter` class, especially looking into methods that are responsible for rendering exponentiation and constants. However, since the actual implementation details are not available, I can only recommend a general approach to debugging and potentially fixing the issue:

1. **Debugging Approach:**
   - Enhance logging within the `PrettyPrinter` class to trace how `pi**(1/E)` is parsed and rendered.
   - Identify the method(s) responsible for rendering exponentiation operations and inspect their handling of symbolic constants.

2. **General Fix Suggestion:**
   - Ensure that symbolic constants and their operations are correctly identified and rendered according to mathematical conventions.
   - If the issue is due to a misinterpretation of the exponentiation operation, review and adjust the logic to correctly handle cases like `pi**(1/E)`.

Without the ability to directly modify the relevant parts of the code, these suggestions aim to guide further investigation and potential fixes. The resolution would require access to and modification of the specific parts of the code that handle the parsing and rendering of mathematical expressions in the pretty printing process.
