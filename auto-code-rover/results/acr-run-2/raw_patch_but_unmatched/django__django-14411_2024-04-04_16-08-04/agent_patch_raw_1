Given the context and the nature of the issue, the patch would need to address the incorrect handling of the label's 'for' attribute within the HTML template `auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html`. Since the template content itself was not directly provided, I will outline a hypothetical patch based on common practices for handling such issues in Django templates. The goal is to ensure that the label does not use a 'for' attribute that points to a non-existent or non-labelable element, given that the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` does not render an input element.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/templates/auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html</file>
<original>
<label for="id_password">Password:</label>
<div>{{ value }}</div>
</original>
<patched>
<div><strong>Password:</strong> {{ value }}</div>
</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The original snippet assumes the presence of a label element with a 'for' attribute pointing to an input field with the id "id_password". However, since `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` renders only text (not an input field), the 'for' attribute is not appropriate.
- The patched version removes the `<label>` element and instead uses a `<div>` with a `<strong>` tag to display the label text, ensuring that there is no misuse of the 'for' attribute. This approach maintains accessibility by clearly indicating the field's purpose without implying an association with an input element.

Note: The actual content of `auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html` might differ, so the original and patched snippets are hypothetical and based on common patterns. The key change is to ensure that labels are not improperly associated with non-input (non-labelable) elements in the widget's template.
