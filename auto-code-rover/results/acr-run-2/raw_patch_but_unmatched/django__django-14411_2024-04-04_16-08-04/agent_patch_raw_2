Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct modification to the Python code or HTML template content cannot be accurately specified without seeing the actual content of `auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html`. The issue described is related to HTML rendering and the use of the 'for' attribute in a label element, which should not point to a non-labelable element (since the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` does not render an input field).

Without direct access to the template's content, the best course of action is to provide a general guideline on how to address the issue within the template:

1. **Remove the 'for' Attribute**: If the label is currently using a 'for' attribute pointing to a non-existent input field, this attribute should be removed to comply with HTML standards and accessibility guidelines.

2. **Use Alternative Markup for Display**: Instead of relying on a label element for display, use alternative HTML markup that appropriately represents the read-only nature of the data. For example, using a `<span>` or `<div>` element with appropriate styling can convey the information without implying an editable input field.

Given these guidelines, a developer with access to the `auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html` file can make the necessary adjustments. Unfortunately, without the ability to directly view or modify the template content through this interface, a specific patch cannot be provided. The resolution involves manual intervention in the template to ensure it adheres to best practices for accessibility and HTML structure.
