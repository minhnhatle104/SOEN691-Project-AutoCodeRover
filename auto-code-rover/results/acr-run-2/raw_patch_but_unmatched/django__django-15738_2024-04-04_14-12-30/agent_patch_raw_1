Given the issue description and the constraints of my capabilities, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on standard Django model and migration practices. This patch assumes the goal is to change the `project_data_set` field in the `Authors` model from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField` and to address the `unique_together` constraint issue described.

Please note, the actual file paths, model definitions, and migration files would depend on your project's specific structure and state, which I cannot access. The following is a conceptual guide to how the modifications might be structured:

# modification 1
```python
<file>app/models.py</file>
<original>class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_set = models.ForeignKey(
        ProjectDataSet,
        on_delete=models.PROTECT
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)</original>
<patched>class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_sets = models.ManyToManyField(
        ProjectDataSet,
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>app/migrations/XXXX_auto_migration_remove_unique_together.py</file>
<original># This is a hypothetical migration file content and would not exist as is.
# The original section is left intentionally blank as this represents a new migration file creation.</original>
<patched>from django.db import migrations, models

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('app', 'previous_migration_file_name'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
            name='authors',
            unique_together=set(),
        ),
    ]</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>app/migrations/YYYY_auto_migration_add_manytomany.py</file>
<original># This is a hypothetical migration file content and would not exist as is.
# The original section is left intentionally blank as this represents a new migration file creation.</original>
<patched>from django.db import migrations, models
import django.db.models.deletion

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('app', 'XXXX_auto_migration_remove_unique_together'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RemoveField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_set',
        ),
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_sets',
            field=models.ManyToManyField(to='app.ProjectDataSet'),
        ),
    ]</patched>
```

Please adjust the file paths (`app/models.py`, `app/migrations/XXXX_auto_migration_remove_unique_together.py`, `app/migrations/YYYY_auto_migration_add_manytomany.py`) and migration dependencies (`'app', 'previous_migration_file_name'`) according to your project's actual structure and migration history. The migration file names (`XXXX_auto_migration_remove_unique_together.py` and `YYYY_auto_migration_add_manytomany.py`) are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual migration file names generated by Django when you run `makemigrations`.

This patch is a conceptual guide and should be adapted to fit the specifics of your Django project. Always test migrations thoroughly in a development environment before applying them to production.
