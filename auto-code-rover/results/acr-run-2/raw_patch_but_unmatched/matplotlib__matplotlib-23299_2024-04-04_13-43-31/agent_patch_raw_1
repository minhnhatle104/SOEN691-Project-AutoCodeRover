Given the context and the nature of the issue, a direct patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the internal workings and design decisions of Matplotlib. However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the issue based on the provided information.

The issue arises when `matplotlib.get_backend()` is called, which leads to the clearing of figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`. This suggests that there might be an unintended side effect happening when querying the backend that interferes with the state of `Gcf.figs`.

A potential approach to patching this issue would involve ensuring that the state of `Gcf.figs` is preserved when the backend is queried or changed. This could be achieved by implementing a mechanism to temporarily store the state of `Gcf.figs` before any backend-related operation is performed and then restoring it afterward if necessary.

However, without a clear understanding of why `get_backend()` or changing the backend would clear `Gcf.figs`, any modification is speculative. It's also important to consider that any changes should not interfere with the intended functionality of backend switching or the management of figure states.

Below is a conceptual patch that aims to preserve the state of `Gcf.figs` around backend queries. This is purely illustrative and may not be directly applicable without further testing and validation within the Matplotlib codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py</file>
<original>def get_backend():
    """
    Return the name of the current backend.

    See Also
    --------
    matplotlib.use
    """
    return rcParams['backend']
</original>
<patched>def get_backend():
    """
    Return the name of the current backend.

    See Also
    --------
    matplotlib.use
    """
    # Temporarily store the state of Gcf.figs
    from matplotlib._pylab_helpers import Gcf
    _temp_figs = Gcf.figs.copy()
    
    backend = rcParams['backend']
    
    # Restore the state of Gcf.figs
    Gcf.figs = _temp_figs
    
    return backend
</patched>
```

Please note, this patch assumes that the issue is directly related to the querying of the backend and its side effects on `Gcf.figs`. It's a speculative fix and should be thoroughly reviewed and tested by the Matplotlib development team. The actual cause of the issue might be more complex and require a different approach or a combination of changes in multiple parts of the Matplotlib codebase.
