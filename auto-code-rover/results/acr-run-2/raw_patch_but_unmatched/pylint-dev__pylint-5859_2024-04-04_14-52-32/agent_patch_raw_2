Given the constraints and the nature of the request, without direct access to the specific implementation details of pylint's codebase and the exact location of the bug, it's not feasible to provide an accurate patch. The speculative solution provided was intended to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the described issue based on common programming patterns and the nature of the problem as described.

To truly address the issue within pylint, one would need to:

1. **Identify the exact location** within the codebase where note tags specified with the `--notes` option are processed and matched against comments in the source code.
2. **Understand the current logic** for how these tags are validated and why punctuation-only tags might be ignored or not matched correctly.
3. **Modify the validation or matching logic** to ensure that punctuation-only tags are correctly recognized and processed, ensuring that fixme warnings are generated as expected.

Without the ability to directly view and interact with the pylint codebase, any attempt to provide a specific patch would be purely speculative and might not align with the actual implementation details.

For developers working on pylint or similar projects facing this issue, the recommended steps would involve:

- Reviewing the logic related to parsing and handling the `--notes` option to understand how tags are extracted and used.
- Ensuring that the logic for matching tags against comments does not inadvertently exclude punctuation-only tags due to validation rules or matching criteria.
- Writing unit tests to cover cases with punctuation-only tags to ensure the intended behavior is achieved and maintained.

This approach would allow for a targeted and effective resolution to the issue based on the actual code and logic involved.
