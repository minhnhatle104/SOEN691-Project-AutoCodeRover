Given the constraints and the nature of the request, without direct access to the specific implementation details of pylint's codebase and the exact location of the bug, it's not feasible to provide an accurate or applicable patch. My previous attempts to construct a hypothetical patch were illustrative and based on common patterns that could potentially address the described issue. However, without precise details from the actual codebase, creating a valid patch is beyond the scope of this interaction.

Addressing the issue within pylint as described would require direct access to the codebase for a thorough review and understanding of how the `--notes` option and note tags are processed. This would involve identifying the method or function where the tags are matched against comments and modifying the logic to ensure that punctuation-only tags are correctly recognized and processed.

For anyone looking to resolve this issue in a real-world scenario, the steps would include:

1. Locating the part of the code (likely within `pylint/checkers/misc.py` or related configuration handling) that processes the `--notes` option.
2. Understanding the current implementation to identify why punctuation-only tags are not being matched correctly.
3. Modifying the implementation to correctly handle punctuation-only tags, ensuring they are recognized and reported as fixme warnings.
4. Adding or updating unit tests to cover the new behavior and prevent regressions.

This process requires access to the pylint codebase, a good understanding of its architecture and implementation details, and the ability to test changes to ensure they address the issue without introducing new problems.

I apologize for any confusion and hope this clarifies the limitations of providing a specific patch in this context.
