Given the information we have, I'll create a hypothetical patch based on a common pattern that could potentially cause the described issue in a system like pylint. This patch assumes that the issue lies in the handling of note tags that are entirely punctuation within the logic that processes comments for fixme warnings.

Please note, this is a speculative solution crafted based on the described problem and the identified potential bug location. The actual code and necessary changes might differ.

# modification 1
```python
<file>pylint/checkers/misc.py</file>
<original>
# This is a speculative original code snippet, assuming there's a method that filters or matches note tags
def is_valid_note_tag(tag):
    return tag.isalnum()
</original>
<patched>
# Updated method to consider tags that are entirely punctuation as valid
def is_valid_note_tag(tag):
    return tag.isalnum() or all(char in string.punctuation for char in tag)
</patched>
```

This modification assumes there's a method responsible for validating note tags, which previously only considered alphanumeric tags as valid. The patch updates this method to also consider tags that are entirely made up of punctuation characters as valid. This change would allow pylint to recognize and report fixme warnings for comments tagged with punctuation-only note tags when specified with the `--notes` option.

Please remember, without access to the actual pylint codebase and specific details about the implementation of the feature in question, this patch is purely illustrative and intended to demonstrate the kind of change that might resolve the described issue. A real fix would require a thorough review of the relevant code and testing to ensure the change correctly addresses the problem without introducing new issues.
