Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, a direct patch to address the unexpected presence of `__dict__` on `Symbol` instances, based on the provided context, cannot be accurately formulated without identifying the specific change that introduced this behavior. The provided code snippets and analysis do not reveal a direct cause or a specific location where a change could be applied to resolve the issue.

The issue likely stems from a more systemic or indirect change in the codebase between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7, which may not be directly related to the `Symbol` class definition itself but rather to how instances of this class (or potentially its parent classes) are handled or modified at runtime.

Without the ability to directly identify and address the underlying cause of the issue through the provided context and API calls, any attempt to write a patch would be speculative and might not address the root cause of the problem. 

A proper resolution would involve:
1. Accessing the version control system to compare the state of the `Symbol` class and relevant parts of the codebase between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.
2. Identifying any changes related to class definitions, inheritance, dynamic attribute assignments, or other systemic changes that could affect the behavior of `Symbol` instances.
3. Testing the impact of identified changes on the presence of `__dict__` in `Symbol` instances and formulating a precise patch based on this analysis.

Given these limitations, I recommend a thorough review and comparison of the relevant parts of the codebase between the two versions by the development team to identify and address the specific change(s) that led to this issue.
