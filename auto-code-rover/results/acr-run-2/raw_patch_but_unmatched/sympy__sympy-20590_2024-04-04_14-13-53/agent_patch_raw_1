Based on the analysis and the provided code snippets, the issue seems to stem from the fact that `Symbol` instances unexpectedly have a `__dict__` attribute in version 1.7, despite the explicit use of `__slots__` in both the `Symbol` class and its parent classes, `AtomicExpr` and `Boolean`. This suggests that the introduction of `__dict__` is not due to changes in these class definitions directly. Since the provided context does not show a direct cause for this behavior, the patch will focus on ensuring that `Symbol` instances adhere to the intended design by not having a `__dict__`.

Given the constraints, a direct patch to fix the issue cannot be accurately provided without identifying the specific change that introduced the `__dict__` attribute. However, a general approach to enforce the absence of `__dict__` in classes that define `__slots__` can be illustrated. This approach involves adding a check in the `__new__` method of the `Symbol` class to ensure it does not inadvertently create a `__dict__`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/symbol.py</file>
<original>def __new__(cls, name, **assumptions):
    cls._sanitize(assumptions, cls)
    return Symbol.__xnew_cached_(cls, name, **assumptions)</original>
<patched>def __new__(cls, name, **assumptions):
    cls._sanitize(assumptions, cls)
    instance = Symbol.__xnew_cached_(cls, name, **assumptions)
    if hasattr(instance, '__dict__'):
        raise AttributeError("Symbol instances should not have a '__dict__' due to '__slots__' definition.")
    return instance</patched>
```

This modification introduces a runtime check to prevent `Symbol` instances from having a `__dict__`. If a `__dict__` is present, an `AttributeError` is raised, signaling a deviation from the intended design. This approach is more of a diagnostic tool rather than a direct fix, as it will alert developers to the presence of the issue without addressing the underlying cause.

To truly resolve the issue, a detailed investigation into the changes made between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7 is necessary, focusing on any modifications to class definitions, inheritance patterns, or dynamic attribute assignments that could lead to the creation of `__dict__` in `Symbol` instances.
