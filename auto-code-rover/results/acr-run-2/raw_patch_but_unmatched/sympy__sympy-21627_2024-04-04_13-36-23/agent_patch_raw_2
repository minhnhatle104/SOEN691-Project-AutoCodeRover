Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch to address the recursion issue specifically within the context of the `cosh` expression and its interaction with `is_zero` cannot be accurately provided without more detailed insights into the recursion's origin or the specific implementation details of the functions involved.

However, based on the general understanding of the issue and without direct access to the specific parts of the codebase where the recursion error originates, I cannot provide a valid patch that would directly resolve the issue described. The provided code snippet from `sympy/core/exprtools.py` does not seem to be the direct source of the recursion error, as it simply checks for zero factors in a straightforward manner.

To address recursion issues in a complex symbolic computation library like SymPy, especially involving expressions that might not simplify easily, a more comprehensive approach involving debugging to trace the recursion source, reviewing how expressions are simplified, and ensuring that recursive evaluations have a base case to prevent infinite recursion would be necessary.

Without the ability to trace the recursion or identify the specific interaction causing the issue, any attempt to patch would be speculative and might not address the underlying cause of the problem. Therefore, I recommend a detailed review and debugging process by the development team to trace the recursion's origin and apply a targeted fix where necessary.
