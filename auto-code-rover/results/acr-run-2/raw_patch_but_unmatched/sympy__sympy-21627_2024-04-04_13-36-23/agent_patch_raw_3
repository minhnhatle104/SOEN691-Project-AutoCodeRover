Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be provided without more detailed insights into the exact cause of the recursion error within the project's codebase. The information provided does not directly point to a specific section of the code that could be patched to resolve the issue, and my previous attempts to construct a hypothetical patch were not aligned with the actual structure and requirements of the project.

In the context of the issue described and based on the general practices for addressing recursion depth errors in Python, particularly within complex symbolic mathematics libraries like SymPy, the resolution often involves either optimizing the recursion logic to ensure it terminates properly or implementing checks to prevent excessive recursion depth. However, without precise details on where the recursion error occurs in the code when evaluating or simplifying the `cosh` expression, suggesting a specific code modification is not feasible.

Therefore, I must clarify that without the ability to directly analyze the codebase, trace the error, or make further valid search API calls to pinpoint the problematic code section, I cannot provide a valid patch or code modification to resolve the described issue. The resolution of such issues typically requires access to the full codebase, the ability to run the code and reproduce the error, and debugging tools to trace the source of excessive recursion.

I recommend that developers facing this issue use Python's debugging tools, such as the debugger (`pdb`) or tracing utilities, to identify the exact call stack at the point where the recursion depth limit is exceeded. This approach will help pinpoint the specific functions or methods where an infinite recursion or an overly deep recursive call chain occurs, allowing for targeted modifications to the code to prevent such errors.

I apologize for any confusion and for not being able to provide a direct solution under the given constraints.
