Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'll provide a hypothetical approach to creating a patch for the described issue with the `dbshell` command in Django, specifically for handling PostgreSQL command-line arguments. Since I cannot directly access the actual Django codebase or the specific implementation details of the `dbshell` command, this patch will be based on a general understanding of how Django's database commands might be structured and the common practices for handling command-line arguments in Python.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch meant to illustrate how one might address the issue based on the problem description. The actual code in Django's `dbshell.py` may differ significantly, and adjustments would be needed to align with Django's coding practices and the specific architecture of the management command system.

```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/dbshell.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for the original code snippet, as the exact implementation details are not provided.
# Typically, the code here would construct the command line for launching the PostgreSQL shell,
# including appending the database name and any additional parameters.
</original>
<patched>
# Import necessary libraries
import subprocess
from django.conf import settings

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Connects to the database shell.'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        # Assuming `settings.DATABASES['default']` holds the database settings
        db_settings = settings.DATABASES['default']
        
        # Construct the base command for psql
        psql_command = ['psql']
        
        # Add connection parameters
        if db_settings['USER']:
            psql_command.extend(['-U', db_settings['USER']])
        if db_settings['HOST']:
            psql_command.extend(['-h', db_settings['HOST']])
        if db_settings['PORT']:
            psql_command.extend(['-p', str(db_settings['PORT'])])
        
        # Add additional parameters before the database name
        # Assuming additional parameters are passed through a command-line option `--psql-params`
        additional_params = options.get('psql_params', '')
        if additional_params:
            psql_command.extend(additional_params.split(' '))
        
        # Finally, add the database name
        psql_command.append(db_settings['NAME'])
        
        # Execute the command
        subprocess.run(psql_command)
</patched>
```

This patch assumes a simplified version of how the `dbshell` command might be implemented for PostgreSQL within Django. It constructs the `psql` command by first adding connection parameters, then any additional parameters specified by the user, and finally the database name. This approach ensures that additional parameters are correctly positioned before the database name, addressing the issue described.

Remember, this is a hypothetical example and may not directly apply to the actual Django codebase without modifications. The actual implementation would need to consider existing conventions, error handling, and how additional parameters are passed to the management command.
