Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, it's clear that providing a precise patch to match the original program without direct visibility into the current implementation of `django/core/management/commands/dbshell.py` is challenging. My previous attempts were based on hypothetical structures and common practices, which might not align with the actual Django codebase.

In a real-world scenario, to address the issue described—ensuring that additional parameters for the PostgreSQL `dbshell` command are correctly positioned before the database name—the developer would need to:

1. **Review the current implementation** of the PostgreSQL connection command within `dbshell.py`, focusing on how the command line is constructed.
2. **Identify the point** where the database name and additional parameters are appended to the command line.
3. **Rearrange the code** to ensure additional parameters are added before the database name.

Without the ability to view the actual code, I can only suggest a conceptual approach to what the patch might involve:

- **Locate** the section of code that constructs the command line array or string for invoking `psql`.
- **Modify** this section to append additional parameters before the database name.

Since I cannot provide a patch that directly matches the original program, I recommend the developer or team working on this issue to manually apply the conceptual approach described above, tailored to the specific implementation details found in `django/core/management/commands/dbshell.py`.

This task requires a detailed understanding of the current code structure and how Django's management commands are implemented, especially those related to database interactions. The developer should also consider how additional parameters are passed (e.g., via command-line arguments or configuration settings) and ensure they are integrated into the command line for `psql` in the correct order.
