Given the context and the nature of the issue with the `dbshell` command in Django, particularly for PostgreSQL where additional parameters should be passed before the database name, I'll provide a hypothetical patch. This patch assumes the structure of Django's management command system and typical patterns for handling database shell commands. Note that the actual implementation might differ based on the Django version and custom modifications.

Since we identified that the issue likely resides in how the command line is constructed for PostgreSQL within the `dbshell` management command, the patch would adjust this construction to ensure additional parameters are correctly positioned.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/dbshell.py</file>
<original>
conn_params = {
    'dbname': settings_dict['NAME'],
    'user': settings_dict['USER'],
    'password': settings_dict['PASSWORD'],
    'host': settings_dict['HOST'],
    'port': settings_dict['PORT'],
}
args += [conn_params['dbname']]
</original>
<patched>
conn_params = {
    'user': settings_dict['USER'],
    'password': settings_dict['PASSWORD'],
    'host': settings_dict['HOST'],
    'port': settings_dict['PORT'],
}
# Assuming additional parameters are passed in a list `additional_params`
# and should be added before the dbname.
args += additional_params
args += [settings_dict['NAME']]
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the additional parameters are collected in a list named `additional_params` and should be inserted before the database name in the command line arguments. The original snippet shows a simplified version of how the connection parameters might be assembled, including the database name. The patched version removes the database name from the `conn_params` dictionary and appends it to the `args` list after the additional parameters have been added.

Please note, this is a hypothetical solution and assumes a specific structure of the `dbshell` command implementation. The actual implementation in Django might require a different approach, especially considering how additional parameters are received and handled within the command. This solution also assumes that the mechanism for collecting and specifying `additional_params` is already in place, which might not be the case in the actual Django implementation.
