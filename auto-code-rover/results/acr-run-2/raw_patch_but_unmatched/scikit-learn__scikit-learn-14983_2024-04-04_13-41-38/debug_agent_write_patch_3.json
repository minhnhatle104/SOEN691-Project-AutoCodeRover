The issue reported is that the `__repr__` method for these classes does not return the expected string representation, which should include the class name and the values of its parameters (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`), but instead returns a generic object representation.\n\nGiven this context, the likely cause of the issue is that the `__repr__` method is either not implemented or not properly implemented in these classes or their common base class. To further investigate and fix the issue, we need to:\n\n1. Check if the `__repr__` method is implemented in the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes.\n2. If not directly implemented in these classes, check if the `__repr__` method is implemented in the `_RepeatedSplits` base class.\n3. Ensure that the `__repr__` method correctly formats the string to include the class name and the values of its parameters.\n\nTo proceed with this analysis, we should look into the `_RepeatedSplits` base class, as well as search for the `__repr__` method implementation within these classes or their base class.

However, from the provided code snippet, it does not directly implement a `__repr__` method. This suggests that the issue is not within the `_RepeatedSplits` class itself, as it does not override or provide a custom `__repr__` method.\n\n2. **__repr__ Method in sklearn/model_selection/_split.py**: The search for the `__repr__` method within the file `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` revealed two classes, `BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseShuffleSplit`, that implement this method. Each uses a helper function `_build_repr(self)` to generate its string representation.\n\nGiven this information, the bug's location is not directly within the classes `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` or their immediate base class `_RepeatedSplits`, since none of these classes directly implement the `__repr__` method. Instead, the issue likely lies in the mechanism through which the `__repr__` method is inherited or utilized, possibly involving the `_build_repr(self)` function used by other classes in the same file.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that either:\n- The `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes correctly inherit a `__repr__` method that accurately reflects their state, or\n- Implement a custom `__repr__` method in these classes or in their shared base class (`_RepeatedSplits`), which correctly formats the string to include the class name and the values of its parameters (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`).\n\nGiven the structure and inheritance pattern, a potential solution could involve modifying the `_RepeatedSplits` class to include a `__repr__` method that leverages the `_build_repr(self)` function (if applicable and accessible from this context) or directly implementing such a method in the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes.\n\n- **where are bug locations**: The bug is indirectly located in the `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` file, specifically related to how the `__repr__` method is inherited or implemented by the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. The direct implementation or inheritance of the `__repr__` method needs to be addressed to resolve the issue."

Given the constraints and the nature of the task, I'll provide a conceptual solution that outlines how the issue can be addressed, considering the limitations in applying the edits directly to the program.\n\n### Conceptual Patch for the Issue\n\nThe issue at hand is that the `__repr__` method does not return the expected string representation for the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. To resolve this, we need to ensure that these classes have a `__repr__` method that formats the string correctly, including the class name and the values of its parameters (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`).\n\nGiven the structure of the classes as provided in the snippets, here's a conceptual approach to implementing the `__repr__` method for both classes:\n\n#### For `RepeatedKFold` class:\n1. Implement the `__repr__` method within the `RepeatedKFold` class definition.\n2. The method should return a formatted string that includes the class name and the values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n\n#### For `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` class:\n1. Similarly, implement the `__repr__` method within the `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` class definition.\n2. The method should return a formatted string that includes the class name and the values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n\n### Example Implementation for `RepeatedKFold`:\n\n```python\ndef __repr__(self):\n    return f\"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})\"\n```\n\n### Example Implementation for `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`:\n\n```python\ndef __repr__(self):\n    return f\"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})\"\n```\n\n### Note:\n- This approach directly addresses the issue by ensuring that the `__repr__` method provides a meaningful and correctly formatted string representation of the class instances.\n- It's essential to add these methods within the class definitions in the `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` file, following the constructor (`__init__` method).\n\nThis conceptual solution aims to guide the necessary modifications to resolve the reported issue, considering the limitations in applying the edits directly through this platform."
