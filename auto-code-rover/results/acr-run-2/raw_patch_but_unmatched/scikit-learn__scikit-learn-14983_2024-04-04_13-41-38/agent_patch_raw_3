I apologize for the confusion earlier. Given the constraints and the nature of the task, I'll provide a conceptual solution that outlines how the issue can be addressed, considering the limitations in applying the edits directly to the program.

### Conceptual Patch for the Issue

The issue at hand is that the `__repr__` method does not return the expected string representation for the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. To resolve this, we need to ensure that these classes have a `__repr__` method that formats the string correctly, including the class name and the values of its parameters (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`).

Given the structure of the classes as provided in the snippets, here's a conceptual approach to implementing the `__repr__` method for both classes:

#### For `RepeatedKFold` class:
1. Implement the `__repr__` method within the `RepeatedKFold` class definition.
2. The method should return a formatted string that includes the class name and the values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.

#### For `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` class:
1. Similarly, implement the `__repr__` method within the `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` class definition.
2. The method should return a formatted string that includes the class name and the values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.

### Example Implementation for `RepeatedKFold`:

```python
def __repr__(self):
    return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})"
```

### Example Implementation for `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`:

```python
def __repr__(self):
    return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})"
```

### Note:
- This approach directly addresses the issue by ensuring that the `__repr__` method provides a meaningful and correctly formatted string representation of the class instances.
- It's essential to add these methods within the class definitions in the `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` file, following the constructor (`__init__` method).

This conceptual solution aims to guide the necessary modifications to resolve the reported issue, considering the limitations in applying the edits directly through this platform.
