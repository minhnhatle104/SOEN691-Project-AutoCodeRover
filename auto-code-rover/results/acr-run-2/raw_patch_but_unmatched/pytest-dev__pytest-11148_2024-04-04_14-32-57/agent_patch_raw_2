Given the constraints of our interaction and the lack of direct access to specific code snippets or file paths causing the issue, I provided a speculative approach to address the problem based on common practices for handling module duplication and namespace packages in Python. However, without concrete examples of the original code causing the issue, crafting a precise patch that directly applies to the program is challenging.

In real-world scenarios, developers would address such issues by closely examining the codebase, identifying the exact locations where the problem occurs, and then applying targeted fixes. Since we cannot accurately pinpoint the problematic code segments or file paths in this simulated environment, I recommend the following general steps to address the issue based on the description provided:

1. **Review Import Statements**: Ensure consistent use of import mechanisms throughout the project. Transition fully to `importlib` if moving towards PEP 420 namespace packages.

2. **Singleton Import Pattern**: Implement a pattern to check if a module is already imported before importing it again, using `importlib` and checking `sys.modules`.

3. **Test Configuration Review**: Examine the test configurations and setups to ensure they align with the new import mechanisms and do not inadvertently cause module duplication.

4. **Consult Documentation and Community Resources**: For issues related to PEP 420 namespace packages, `importlib`, and pytest configurations, consulting the official Python documentation and community forums can provide valuable insights and solutions.

5. **Debugging and Logging**: Add logging around import statements and module usage, especially in the testing framework, to identify where duplicates might be created.

Without specific code snippets or errors to address, these steps offer a high-level approach to diagnosing and potentially resolving the issue described. Developers facing similar issues should adapt these recommendations to their specific context and codebase.
