Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to specific code snippets or file paths that are causing the problem, I'll propose a hypothetical patch based on common practices for addressing issues related to module duplication and namespace packages in Python, especially when transitioning to `importlib` and PEP 420 namespace packages. This patch is speculative and aims to provide a general direction for resolving the type of issue described.

### Hypothetical Patch for Module Duplication Issue

The issue seems to stem from the transition to PEP 420 namespace packages and the use of `importlib` for dynamic imports, which might be causing the `pmxbot.logging` module to be imported twice, leading to inconsistencies.

#### Modification 1: Ensuring Singleton Import Mechanism

One common cause of such issues is the inconsistent use of import mechanisms throughout the project, which can be addressed by standardizing the import statements and ensuring that the `importlib` is used consistently to import the module only once.

```python
<file>src/pmxbot/core.py</file>
<original>
import pmxbot.logging
</original>
<patched>
import importlib
pmxbot_logging = importlib.import_module('pmxbot.logging')
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Utilizing `importlib.util.find_spec` to Prevent Duplicate Imports

Another approach to prevent duplicate imports, especially when dealing with namespace packages, is to check if the module is already loaded before attempting to import it.

```python
<file>src/pmxbot/core.py</file>
<original>
import pmxbot.logging
</original>
<patched>
import sys
import importlib.util
if 'pmxbot.logging' not in sys.modules:
    spec = importlib.util.find_spec("pmxbot.logging")
    pmxbot_logging = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    sys.modules['pmxbot.logging'] = pmxbot_logging
    spec.loader.exec_module(pmxbot_logging)
else:
    pmxbot_logging = sys.modules['pmxbot.logging']
</patched>
```

#### Modification 3: Adjusting Test Configuration to Use the Correct Import Mechanism

If the issue is more prevalent during testing due to the test configuration, ensuring that the tests use the same import mechanism as the application code can help prevent module duplication.

```python
<file>tests/conftest.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming there's a custom import or setup mechanism here that might cause duplication
</original>
<patched>
# Adjust or add import logic here to align with the application's import mechanism
# This is speculative and would need to be adjusted based on the actual test setup code
import importlib
pmxbot_logging = importlib.import_module('pmxbot.logging')
</patched>
```

### Note:

These modifications are speculative and based on common issues related to module imports and namespace packages in Python. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific structure and requirements of the `pmxbot` project. It's crucial to review these changes in the context of the project and test thoroughly to ensure they address the issue without introducing new problems.
