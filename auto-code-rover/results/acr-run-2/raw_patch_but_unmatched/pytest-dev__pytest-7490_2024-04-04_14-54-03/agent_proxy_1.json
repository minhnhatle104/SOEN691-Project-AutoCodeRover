            "content": "- **do we need more context**:\n\nGiven the current analysis, it seems necessary to understand the changes in pytest's handling of markers and test execution between versions 5.x and 6.0.0rc0 to pinpoint the cause of the issue. Specifically, we need to look into the pytest changelog, commit history, or any documentation related to version changes affecting markers. However, since the capability to search changelogs or commit history directly via API calls is not provided in the current setup, this step would need to be performed outside of the available search APIs.\n\n- **where are bug locations**:\n\nWithout direct access to the changelog or specific commit changes between pytest versions 5.x and 6.0.0rc0, we cannot definitively pinpoint the exact file or method where the bug is located. However, the issue likely resides in the logic that processes markers during test execution or evaluation, potentially affecting how dynamically added `xfail` markers are handled in version 6.0.0rc0 compared to version 5.x. The `add_marker` method in `src/_pytest/nodes.py` is directly involved in adding markers, but the change in behavior suggests the issue might be more related to how these markers are subsequently processed rather than how they are added."
