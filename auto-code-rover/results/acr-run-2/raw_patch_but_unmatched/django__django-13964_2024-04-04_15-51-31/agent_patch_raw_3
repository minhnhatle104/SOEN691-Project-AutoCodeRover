Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific codebase or the ability to execute search API calls, I'm unable to provide a patch that directly corresponds to the actual program files and code snippets. My previous attempts were conceptual and aimed to guide towards a potential solution based on common Django ORM practices.

However, addressing the issue described requires a nuanced understanding of Django's ORM, specifically how it handles ForeignKey relationships and the timing of updates to related objects' primary keys. The solution would likely involve ensuring that changes to a non-numeric primary key on a related model are correctly reflected in the ForeignKey field of the referencing model before saving.

Without the ability to match edits to the original program, I recommend the following general steps to investigate and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Review Django Model Save Method**: Investigate the `save` method of both the `Product` and `Order` models to ensure they correctly handle saving of instances and updating of related fields. Consider overriding these methods if necessary to enforce the correct order of operations.

2. **Examine ForeignKey Field Behavior**: Look into how the ForeignKey field on the `Order` model is updated when the related `Product` instance's primary key changes. This may involve delving into Django's source code or documentation to understand the expected behavior.

3. **Implement Signal Handlers**: Use Django's signal framework to catch changes to the `Product` instance's primary key and update the `Order` instance's ForeignKey field accordingly before saving.

4. **Manual ForeignKey Management**: As a workaround, manually manage the ForeignKey relationship by explicitly setting the `Order` instance's ForeignKey field after the `Product` instance's primary key is known and before saving the `Order` instance.

5. **Consult Django Community**: If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the Django community for support. The Django Users mailing list, Stack Overflow, and Django's official issue tracker are valuable resources for troubleshooting complex ORM issues.

I hope this guidance is helpful. If you have specific questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
