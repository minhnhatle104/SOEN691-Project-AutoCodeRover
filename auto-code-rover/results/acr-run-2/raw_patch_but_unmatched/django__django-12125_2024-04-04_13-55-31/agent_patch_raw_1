Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems the problem lies not within the `EnumField` class itself but in how Django's migration system references inner classes and enums within model definitions. Since we don't have direct access to the specific parts of the Django codebase that handle migration file generation or model field introspection, I'll propose a conceptual patch that addresses the general issue described. This patch would involve modifying the part of Django's migration framework that generates references to model fields in migration files, ensuring it correctly handles inner classes.

However, without specific code snippets from the actual Django migration framework that are responsible for this behavior, the following patch is hypothetical and aims to illustrate the kind of change that might resolve the issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/autodetector.py</file>
<original>field_definition = "%s.%s" % (model._meta.app_label, field_class.__name__)</original>
<patched>field_definition = field_class.__module__ + "." + field_class.__qualname__</patched>
```

Explanation: This hypothetical patch changes how the field definition is generated in a migration file. Instead of using the model's app label and the field class's `__name__`, which does not account for inner classes (leading to incorrect references for inner classes), it uses the field class's `__module__` and `__qualname__`. The `__qualname__` (qualified name) property includes the full path to the class, including any containing classes, which would correctly reference inner classes.

Please note: This patch is conceptual and based on the assumption of how Django's migration system might generate field references. The actual implementation in Django may differ, and the file and code snippet provided here are illustrative rather than exact. To implement a real fix, one would need to identify the precise location in Django's codebase where field references in migration files are generated and apply a similar logic to ensure inner classes are correctly referenced.
