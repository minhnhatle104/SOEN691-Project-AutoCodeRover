I understand the constraints and the need for a specific solution to the issue described. However, given the limitations of this platform and the inability to directly access or modify the `pylint` codebase, I'm unable to provide a real patch or code modifications that directly correspond to the actual `pylint` source code.

To contribute meaningfully within these constraints, I suggest a general approach that could be taken to investigate and potentially resolve the issue based on common practices in Python development and my understanding of how linting tools like `pylint` might work:

1. **Investigate Module Loading and Namespace Handling**: The issue might stem from how `pylint` handles namespaces when a directory and a Python file share the same name. Python allows both a module (a Python file) and a package (a directory with an `__init__.py` file) to share the same namespace, but special care must be taken when loading these modules to avoid conflicts.

2. **Review `pylint`'s Use of Python's Import System**: Python's import system has evolved over time, and different versions of Python handle implicit namespace packages and module loading differently. Reviewing how `pylint` interacts with this system could reveal discrepancies or assumptions that lead to the observed issue.

3. **Enhance Error Handling for Module Discovery**: Improving how `pylint` reports and handles errors during module discovery might not resolve the underlying issue but could provide clearer guidance to users encountering similar problems, helping them to troubleshoot and apply workarounds more effectively.

Without the ability to provide a specific patch, these steps represent a conceptual approach to diagnosing and addressing the type of issue described. For those with access to the `pylint` codebase and the ability to make changes, focusing on how modules and packages are discovered, loaded, and linted could yield a solution. Engaging with the `pylint` developer community, including reviewing open issues and discussing potential fixes, would also be a valuable part of the process.
