Given the constraints of our interaction and the lack of direct access to the `pylint` codebase or specific details about the implementation related to the issue, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices and Python's module handling. This patch aims to address the issue where `pylint` fails to lint a directory if there is a module (file) with the same name as the directory within it. Please note, without the exact code paths or implementation details, this solution is speculative and intended as a conceptual guide.

### Hypothetical Patch

The issue described suggests a conflict in how `pylint` handles directories and files with the same name, particularly around the expectations for `__init__.py` files in Python packages. A potential solution could involve modifying the module discovery logic to better handle this scenario, ensuring that both files and directories are correctly identified and processed without mistakenly requiring an `__init__.py` file in every case.

# modification 1
```python
<file>pylint/module_discovery.py</file>
<original>
if os.path.isdir(module_path) and not os.path.exists(os.path.join(module_path, '__init__.py')):
    raise SomeException("Directory does not contain an __init__.py file")
</original>
<patched>
if os.path.isdir(module_path) and not os.path.exists(os.path.join(module_path, '__init__.py')):
    # Allow directories without an __init__.py file to be considered packages in Python 3.3+
    if sys.version_info < (3, 3):
        raise SomeException("Directory does not contain an __init__.py file")
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>pylint/path_resolution.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical code snippet showing how pylint might currently resolve module paths
module_name = os.path.basename(module_path)
if os.path.exists(module_path + '.py'):
    module_path += '.py'
</original>
<patched>
# Adjusted to handle cases where a directory and a file have the same name
module_name = os.path.basename(module_path)
if os.path.isdir(module_path) and os.path.exists(module_path + '.py'):
    # Prioritize directory over file if both exist
    pass
elif os.path.exists(module_path + '.py'):
    module_path += '.py'
</patched>
```

### Explanation

- **Modification 1** addresses the issue where `pylint` might incorrectly require an `__init__.py` file for directories to be considered packages, which is not a requirement in Python 3.3 and later. The patch relaxes this requirement based on the Python version.

- **Modification 2** proposes a change in how `pylint` resolves paths when both a directory and a file share the same name. The updated logic ensures that both are correctly identified without mistakenly appending `.py` to the path when it refers to a directory that should be treated as a package.

Please note, these modifications are based on a hypothetical understanding of the `pylint` codebase and the issue described. Actual implementation details may vary, and these patches would need to be adapted to fit the real codebase structure and logic.
