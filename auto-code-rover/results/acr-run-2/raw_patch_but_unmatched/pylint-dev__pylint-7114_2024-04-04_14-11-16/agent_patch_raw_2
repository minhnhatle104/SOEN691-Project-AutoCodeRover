Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a precise patch for the `pylint` issue described due to the lack of direct access to the specific implementation details of the `pylint` codebase. My responses are based on general knowledge and understanding of Python and common practices in handling modules and packages, rather than specific insights into the `pylint` project's code.

To address the issue within the `pylint` project, where linting fails if a module contains a module of the same name, a detailed understanding of `pylint`'s module discovery and linting process is required. This would involve examining how `pylint` differentiates between files and directories during its linting process, as well as how it handles Python's module and package conventions.

Without the ability to directly view or modify the `pylint` codebase, I recommend the following general approach for contributors or maintainers looking to resolve this issue:

1. **Review Module Discovery Logic**: Start by reviewing the logic within `pylint` that is responsible for discovering modules and packages to lint. This may involve tracing through the code that handles command-line arguments and identifies the targets for linting.

2. **Analyze Path Handling**: Examine how `pylint` constructs and handles paths during the linting process, especially in cases where there may be ambiguity between a file and a directory with the same name.

3. **Test and Debug**: Create test cases that replicate the issue, including a directory structure with a file and a directory sharing the same name. Use debugging tools to step through the `pylint` linting process with these test cases to identify where the process fails or behaves unexpectedly.

4. **Implement and Test a Solution**: Once the problematic area of code is identified, implement a solution that allows `pylint` to correctly handle the scenario. This solution should then be thoroughly tested with a variety of module and package configurations to ensure it does not introduce regressions or new issues.

5. **Consult `pylint` Documentation and Community**: Leverage the `pylint` documentation and community resources, such as issue trackers and discussion forums, to gather additional insights or to share proposed solutions for feedback.

While I hope this guidance is helpful, I acknowledge that it does not provide the specific code modifications requested. Addressing the issue effectively would require direct access to the `pylint` codebase and a detailed investigation by those with the ability to modify and test the project's code.
