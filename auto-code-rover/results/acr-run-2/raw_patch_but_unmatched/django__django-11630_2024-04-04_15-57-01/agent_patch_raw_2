Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without specific details on the models or settings directly from the project, I provided a conceptual approach to address the common scenario of conflicting `db_table` names in a Django project. However, since I cannot access or directly modify the actual project files and my previous response might not match your project's specifics, let's focus on a general guideline that you can adapt to your project's needs.

### General Guideline for Resolving Conflicting `db_table` Names

1. **Ensure Unique `db_table` Names Across Your Project**: Go through your models in different apps and ensure that each `db_table` value in the Meta class of your models is unique. This is crucial to avoid conflicts within the same database.

2. **Implement Custom Database Routing (if using multiple databases)**: If your project uses multiple databases and the intention is to have models in different apps point to the same table name but in different databases, you'll need to ensure proper database routing is set up. This involves creating a database router that directs queries for each model to the appropriate database.

3. **Review and Adjust Your Django Settings**: Make sure your `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py` correctly defines all databases used by your project. If using database routers, ensure the `DATABASE_ROUTERS` setting is correctly configured with the path to your router implementation.

4. **Generate and Apply Migrations Carefully**: After making changes to your models or database configurations, generate new migrations and review them to ensure they accurately reflect your intended changes. Apply these migrations to update your database schema accordingly.

5. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your application extensively in a development environment to identify and resolve any issues before they impact your production environment.

### Adapting the Guideline to Your Project

- For each model that was causing the conflict, change the `db_table` value in its Meta class to something unique. If the models are meant to share the same table but in different databases, ensure your database routing logic is correctly set up to handle this.
- If you're not familiar with creating a database router in Django, refer to the [official Django documentation on database routing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/multi-db/#automatic-database-routing) for guidance.
- After making changes, don't forget to create and apply migrations to reflect these changes in your database schema.

This guideline provides a high-level approach to resolving the issue based on Django best practices. You'll need to adapt these steps to fit the specific details and structure of your project.
