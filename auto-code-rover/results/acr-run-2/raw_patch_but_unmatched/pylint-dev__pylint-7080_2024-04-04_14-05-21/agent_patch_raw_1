Given the context and the nature of the issue with `pylint` ignoring `ignore-paths` when the `--recursive=y` option is used, and without direct access to the actual `pylint` codebase or the ability to test changes, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on standard practices and the information derived from the search results shared earlier. This patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue.

### Hypothetical Patch

Since the specific locations and implementations within `pylint` that handle the `ignore-paths` configuration and the `--recursive` option were not directly identified, this patch will focus on a conceptual fix. The fix assumes that the issue lies in the integration of `ignore-paths` configuration during the recursive file discovery process.

#### Modification 1: Enhancing file discovery to respect `ignore-paths`

```python
<file>pylint/utils/utils.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for the original code snippet that performs file discovery
# for linting when the --recursive option is used. The actual implementation details
# and the method name are not provided.
def discover_files_recursively(base_path):
    # Original file discovery logic that does not respect ignore-paths
</original>
<patched>
import re
from pylint.config import find_pylintrc

def discover_files_recursively(base_path):
    # Enhanced file discovery logic that respects ignore-paths
    ignore_paths = []
    pylintrc_path = find_pylintrc()
    if pylintrc_path:
        with open(pylintrc_path, 'r') as pylintrc:
            for line in pylintrc:
                if line.startswith('ignore-paths'):
                    ignore_paths = re.findall(r'"([^"]*)"', line)  # Extract paths within quotes
                    break
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(base_path):
        dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if not any(re.match(pattern, os.path.join(root, d)) for pattern in ignore_paths)]
        for file in files:
            if not any(re.match(pattern, os.path.join(root, file)) for pattern in ignore_paths):
                yield os.path.join(root, file)
</patched>
```

#### Note:
- The `discover_files_recursively` function is a hypothetical placeholder representing the part of the `pylint` codebase responsible for file discovery during recursive linting. The actual function name and implementation details may differ.
- This patch introduces logic to read the `ignore-paths` configuration from the `pylintrc` file (or `pyproject.toml` if `pylint` supports it in the context of your project) and exclude paths that match any of the patterns specified in `ignore-paths` during the recursive file discovery process.
- The use of `re.match` for pattern matching against `ignore-paths` entries is a simplistic approach. Depending on how `ignore-paths` patterns are defined, additional logic might be required to accurately match paths.

This patch is illustrative and may require adjustments to fit the actual code structure and logic of `pylint`. It's recommended to review the `pylint` documentation, source code, and possibly contribute through the official `pylint` repository on GitHub for a precise and tested solution.
