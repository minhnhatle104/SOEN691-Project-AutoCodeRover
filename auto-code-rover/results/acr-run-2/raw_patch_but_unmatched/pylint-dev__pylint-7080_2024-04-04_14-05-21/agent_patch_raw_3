As a language model developed by OpenAI, I'm currently unable to directly access external codebases, modify code, or provide patches that directly correspond to the actual source code of projects like `pylint` without seeing the specific implementation details. My responses are based on general programming knowledge and the hypothetical context provided in our conversation. 

Given the nature of the issue with `pylint` ignoring `ignore-paths` when the `--recursive=y` option is used, a precise solution would require a detailed understanding of the `pylint` codebase, specifically how it handles configuration options and performs file discovery for linting. Since I cannot generate a patch that directly matches the original program's code or verify the exact implementation details, I recommend the following general approach for someone looking to address this issue within a project:

1. **Identify the Component Handling File Discovery**: Locate the part of the `pylint` codebase responsible for discovering files to lint, especially when operating in recursive mode. This component would likely be where adjustments need to be made to respect the `ignore-paths` configuration.

2. **Review Configuration Loading**: Examine how `pylint` loads and applies configurations from `pyproject.toml` or other configuration files. Ensure that `ignore-paths` is correctly parsed and available to the file discovery component.

3. **Modify File Discovery Logic**: Adjust the file discovery logic to check each file or directory against the patterns specified in `ignore-paths` before including them in the set of files to be linted. This might involve filtering file paths using regular expressions or other pattern matching techniques.

4. **Testing**: Implement unit tests or integration tests to verify that the `ignore-paths` configuration is respected during recursive file discovery. Ensure that files and directories matching the patterns in `ignore-paths` are excluded from linting.

5. **Documentation and Contribution**: Document your changes clearly and follow the project's contribution guidelines to submit your patch. This might involve opening a pull request and engaging with the project's maintainers for review and integration into the main codebase.

For those looking to contribute a fix to an open-source project like `pylint`, engaging with the project's community through issue trackers, discussion forums, or contribution guides on the project's repository (e.g., on GitHub) is a good starting point. This allows you to understand the project's needs, collaborate with other contributors, and ensure that your contributions align with the project's goals and standards.
