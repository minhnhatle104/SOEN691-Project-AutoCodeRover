Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific sections of the code where the bug originates or a clear directive on the mechanism causing the "Invalid vmin or vmax" error, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. The issue seems to revolve around the interaction between the `norm` property of a mappable object (like those handled by `QuadMesh`) and its associated colorbar, particularly after the colorbar has been created.

A proper fix would likely involve ensuring that updates to the `norm` property are correctly propagated to the colorbar, possibly by refreshing or updating the colorbar's state to reflect the new normalization parameters. However, without specific details on how these components interact within the matplotlib codebase or the exact cause of the error, suggesting a specific code change is speculative.

In practice, addressing this issue would require a detailed review of the matplotlib source code, particularly the parts that handle the `norm` property updates and the colorbar rendering logic. Developers would need to trace how changes to a mappable's normalization affect its colorbar and identify where the process breaks down, leading to the "Invalid vmin or vmax" error.

Given these considerations, the best course of action would be to report this issue to the matplotlib development team, providing them with the bug report, the traceback, and any relevant code samples. The matplotlib developers would have the necessary context and understanding of the library's internals to identify the root cause and implement a fix.

For educational purposes, if we were to speculate on a patch based on common patterns for handling such synchronization issues, it might involve adding hooks or callbacks that trigger the colorbar to re-evaluate its state when the `norm` of its associated mappable changes. However, without a clear understanding of the existing mechanisms in place for this in matplotlib, such a speculative patch cannot be accurately formulated.
