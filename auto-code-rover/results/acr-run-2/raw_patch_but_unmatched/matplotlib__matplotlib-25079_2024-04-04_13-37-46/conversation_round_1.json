If ``C[i, j]`` is masked, the corresponding\n        quadrilateral will be transparent. Masking of *X* and *Y* is not\n        supported. Use `~.Axes.pcolor` if you need this functionality.\n\n        .. _axes-pcolormesh-grid-orientation:\n\n        **Grid orientation**\n\n        The grid orientation follows the standard matrix convention: An array\n        *C* with shape (nrows, ncolumns) is plotted with the column number as\n        *X* and the row number as *Y*.\n\n        .. _differences-pcolor-pcolormesh:\n\n        **Differences between pcolor() and pcolormesh()**\n\n        Both methods are used to create a pseudocolor plot of a 2D array\n        using quadrilaterals.\n\n        The main difference lies in the created object and internal data\n        handling:\n        While `~.Axes.pcolor` returns a `.PolyCollection`, `~.Axes.pcolormesh`\n        returns a `.QuadMesh`. The latter is more specialized for the given\n        purpose and thus is faster. It should almost always be preferred.\n\n        There is also a slight difference in the handling of masked arrays.\n        Both `~.Axes.pcolor` and `~.Axes.pcolormesh` support masked arrays\n        for *C*. However, only `~.Axes.pcolor` supports masked arrays for *X*\n        and *Y*. The reason lies in the internal handling of the masked values.\n        `~.Axes.pcolor` leaves out the respective polygons from the\n        PolyCollection. `~.Axes.pcolormesh` sets the facecolor of the masked\n        elements to transparent. You can see the difference when using\n        edgecolors. While all edges are drawn irrespective of masking in a\n        QuadMesh, the edge between two adjacent masked quadrilaterals in\n        `~.Axes.pcolor` is not drawn as the corresponding polygons do not\n        exist in the PolyCollection.\n\n        Another difference is the support of Gouraud shading in\n        `~.Axes.pcolormesh`, which is not available with `~.Axes.pcolor`.\n\n        \"\"\"\n        if shading is None:\n            shading = mpl.rcParams['pcolor.shading']\n        shading = shading.lower()\n        kwargs.setdefault('edgecolors', 'none')\n\n        X, Y, C, shading = self._pcolorargs('pcolormesh', *args,\n                                            shading=shading, kwargs=kwargs)\n        coords = np.stack([X, Y], axis=-1)\n        # convert to one dimensional array, except for 3D RGB(A) arrays\n        if C.ndim != 3:\n            C = C.ravel()\n\n        kwargs.setdefault('snap', mpl.rcParams['pcolormesh.snap'])\n\n        collection = mcoll.QuadMesh(\n            coords, antialiased=antialiased, shading=shading,\n            array=C, cmap=cmap, norm=norm, alpha=alpha, **kwargs)\n        collection._scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)\n\n        coords = coords.reshape(-1, 2)  # flatten the grid structure; keep x, y\n\n        # Transform from native to data coordinates?\n        t = collection._transform\n        if (not isinstance(t, mtransforms.Transform) and\n                hasattr(t, '_as_mpl_transform')):\n            t = t._as_mpl_transform(self.axes)\n\n        if t and any(t.contains_branch_seperately(self.transData)):\n            trans_to_data = t - self.transData\n            coords = trans_to_data.transform(coords)\n\n        self.add_collection(collection, autolim=False)\n\n        minx, miny = np.min(coords, axis=0)\n        maxx, maxy = np.max(coords, axis=0)\n        collection.sticky_edges.x[:] = [minx, maxx]\n        collection.sticky_edges.y[:] = [miny, maxy]\n        corners = (minx, miny), (maxx, maxy)\n        self.update_datalim(corners)\n        self._request_autoscale_view()\n        return collection\n</code>\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we can start analyzing the context around the issue reported.\n\n1. **Class `LogNorm` Not Found**: The search for the `LogNorm` class returned no results. This could imply that the class might be part of a module that wasn't directly accessible through the search or that it's dynamically imported or generated in a way that the search couldn't capture. However, `LogNorm` is a normalization class in Matplotlib that's used to normalize data on a logarithmic scale. The issue mentions an \"Invalid vmin or vmax\" error when setting `LogNorm` after a colorbar has been created, suggesting that the problem might be related to how `vmin` and `vmax` are handled or validated within the `LogNorm` implementation or its interaction with other components.\n\n2. **Method `update_scalarmappable` Not Found in Class `collections`**: The search didn't find the `update_scalarmappable` method within a class named `collections`. This method was mentioned in the traceback provided in the issue. It's likely involved in updating the scalar mappable object (which ties data values to colors) when the normalization changes. The inability to find this method could be due to similar reasons as the `LogNorm` class not being found, or possibly an incorrect class name was provided for the search.\n\n3. **`pcolormesh` Method Analysis**:\n    - The `pcolormesh` function is found in two places: `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` and `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`. The latter is likely where the core functionality resides, with the former being a convenience wrapper for easy access through the `plt` alias.\n    - The `pcolormesh` method in `Axes` class takes parameters like `alpha`, `norm`, `cmap`, `vmin`, `vmax`, and others to create a pseudocolor plot. Notably, it supports a `norm` parameter, which is used to normalize the data values for coloring. This is directly relevant to the issue since the bug occurs when changing the `norm` to `LogNorm`.\n    - The method description mentions handling of masked arrays and differences between `pcolormesh` and `pcolor`, but nothing directly hints at the issue described. However, it does indicate that `pcolormesh` returns a `QuadMesh` object, and there's a call to `collection._scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)` within the method. This could be a critical point since the error reported is related to invalid `vmin` or `vmax` values.\n\nGiven this context, the issue might stem from how the `LogNorm` normalization interacts with the existing colorbar and `QuadMesh` object, particularly in how `vmin` and `vmax` values are validated or applied. Since we couldn't directly analyze `LogNorm` or `update_scalarmappable`, the next steps could involve manually reviewing the implementations of these components (if accessible) and understanding how `pcolormesh` and its resulting `QuadMesh` handle norm changes post-creation. A potential area of investigation could be the `_scale_norm` call within `pcolormesh` and how `vmin` and `vmax` are processed there, as well as how the colorbar is updated to reflect changes in normalization."
