Given the context and the nature of the issue, it appears that the problem might be related to how changes in the normalization (`norm`) are not properly propagated to the colorbar, leading to an "Invalid vmin or vmax" error. Since the detailed implementation of `LogNorm` and the exact mechanism of how `norm` updates are handled were not directly available, the patch will focus on ensuring that updates to the `norm` are correctly reflected in the associated colorbar. This involves making sure that when the `norm` of a `QuadMesh` (or any `ScalarMappable`) is updated, the colorbar is also updated to reflect these changes.

However, without direct evidence of the bug's location or a clear understanding of the mechanism causing the "Invalid vmin or vmax" error, proposing a precise patch is challenging. A general approach to address issues like this could involve adding a mechanism to trigger an update to the colorbar when the `norm` of its associated `mappable` is changed. This could be implemented by introducing a callback or observer pattern where the colorbar listens for changes in the `norm` and updates itself accordingly.

Since the actual code causing the issue was not identified, and without a clear indication of where to implement the fix, the following is a hypothetical patch that demonstrates this approach conceptually:

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/collections.py</file>
<original>...</original>
<patched>
# Assuming a method to update the colorbar explicitly is added to the QuadMesh class
def update_colorbar(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'colorbar'):
        self.colorbar.update_normal(self)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>...</original>
<patched>
# In the colorbar method, add a way to link the colorbar update to the mappable's norm update
def colorbar(self, mappable, cax=None, ax=None, use_gridspec=True, **kwargs):
    ...
    cb = cbar.Colorbar(cax, mappable, **{
        k: v for k, v in kwargs.items() if k not in NON_COLORBAR_KEYS})
    # Link the mappable's norm update to the colorbar update
    if hasattr(mappable, 'update_colorbar'):
        mappable.colorbar = cb
    self.stale = True
    return cb
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are conceptual and serve to illustrate a potential approach to solving the issue based on the understanding that updates to the `norm` should trigger updates to the associated colorbar. Actual implementation might require a more in-depth understanding of the matplotlib codebase and the specific mechanisms by which `norm` and colorbars are linked.
