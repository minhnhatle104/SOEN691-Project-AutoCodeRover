Given the limitations and the context provided, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be accurately formulated without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of matplotlib and the specific mechanisms that lead to the "Invalid vmin or vmax" error when updating the `norm` for a mappable after a colorbar has been created.

In real-world scenarios, addressing such a bug would involve a detailed investigation into how the `norm` property is managed within the matplotlib codebase, how changes to it are propagated, and how these changes should be reflected in associated colorbars. This would likely involve debugging, adding or modifying event listeners or callbacks for property changes, and ensuring that colorbars are correctly updated when the properties of their associated mappables change.

Without the ability to directly inspect and modify the matplotlib codebase or more detailed error logs and system behaviors, providing a specific patch is not feasible. The resolution to this issue would require collaboration with the matplotlib development team, who have the necessary context and expertise to diagnose and address the problem effectively.

For users facing this issue, a temporary workaround might involve manually forcing a colorbar update or recreation after changing the `norm` of a mappable. However, this is not an ideal solution and could lead to inefficient or redundant code in applications that frequently adjust normalization parameters.

In summary, while a specific patch cannot be provided under these constraints, the discussion highlights the importance of understanding library internals and the complexities involved in maintaining and updating large, widely-used open-source projects like matplotlib.
