Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the assertion rewriting mechanism in the project, and considering the inability to provide a direct patch that matches the original program, I'll offer a generalized approach that could be adapted to address the issue.

This approach involves enhancing the error message for byte string comparisons to include a more human-readable format, specifically targeting the confusing aspect of displaying ASCII ordinal values without clear context.

### Generalized Approach to Address the Issue

The goal is to modify the assertion error message for byte string comparisons to include both the byte values and their corresponding ASCII characters (when applicable), making the error message more informative and less confusing.

#### Conceptual Patch:

Since I cannot provide a direct patch to match the original program, below is a **conceptual approach** that outlines steps and code changes that could be adapted to the project's specific implementation:

1. **Locate the Assertion Error Message Generation**: Find where the assertion error messages are generated for byte string comparisons. This is likely in a method responsible for formatting the error messages.

2. **Modify the Error Message for Byte Strings**: Implement a check to determine if the comparison involves byte strings and, if so, format the message to include detailed information about the differences.

#### Conceptual Code Change:

```python
# This is a conceptual code snippet and not a direct patch

def format_assertion_error(left, right):
    # Check if the comparison involves byte strings
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        # Custom formatting for byte strings to include ASCII characters
        left_formatted = " ".join([f"{b} ('{chr(b)}')" for b in left])
        right_formatted = " ".join([f"{b} ('{chr(b)}')" for b in right])
        return f"Assertion failed: {left_formatted} != {right_formatted}"
    else:
        # Fallback to the default formatting for other types
        return f"Assertion failed: {left} != {right}"
```

#### Adaptation Steps:

- Identify the specific method or function in the codebase where assertion error messages are generated for comparisons.
- Integrate a conditional check to identify byte string comparisons.
- Implement the custom formatting for byte strings as outlined in the conceptual code change, ensuring it aligns with the project's coding standards and architecture.

This generalized approach and conceptual code change aim to provide a starting point for addressing the issue within the project's specific context. The exact implementation details, including the method names, file locations, and integration points, would need to be determined based on the project's codebase.
