Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the assertion rewriting mechanism in the project, providing an exact patch is challenging. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to address the issue based on common practices in handling byte strings and error messages in Python. This approach would involve enhancing the error message for byte string comparisons to include more human-readable information.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch to match the original program without seeing the actual code, let's conceptualize a solution that could be adapted to the project's specific implementation:

### Conceptual Solution

The goal is to modify the assertion error message for byte string comparisons to include both the byte values and their corresponding ASCII characters (when applicable), making the error message more informative and less confusing.

1. **Identify the Assertion Rewriting Mechanism**: Locate the part of the code responsible for rewriting assertions and generating error messages. This is likely in a file related to testing or assertions, such as `rewrite.py` or similar.

2. **Enhance the Byte String Comparison Error Message**: Modify the error message generation to check if the comparison involves byte strings and, if so, format the message to include detailed information about the differences.

Since I cannot provide an exact match for the original program, below is a **conceptual patch** in Python that illustrates how one might enhance the error message for byte string comparisons:

```python
# Conceptual Patch

# Assuming this function is part of the assertion rewriting mechanism
def generate_assertion_error_message(left, right):
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        # Custom formatting for byte strings
        left_repr = ' '.join([f"{b} ({chr(b)})" for b in left])
        right_repr = ' '.join([f"{b} ({chr(b)})" for b in right])
        message = f"AssertionError: assert {left_repr} == {right_repr}\n"
        # Additional details about differences could be added here
    else:
        # Default error message for other types
        message = f"AssertionError: assert {left} == {right}"
    return message
```

This conceptual patch is meant to illustrate the approach rather than serve as a direct modification to the project's codebase. The actual implementation would need to be adapted to fit the specific architecture and coding standards of the project, including the correct integration points for modifying assertion error messages.

Adapting this conceptual solution to the project would involve:

- Locating the correct place in the codebase where assertion error messages are generated.
- Implementing a check to determine if the comparison involves byte strings.
- Formatting the error message for byte string comparisons to include both the byte values and their ASCII representations, making the output more understandable.

This approach aims to make the assertion error messages for byte string comparisons clearer and more informative, addressing the issue described.
