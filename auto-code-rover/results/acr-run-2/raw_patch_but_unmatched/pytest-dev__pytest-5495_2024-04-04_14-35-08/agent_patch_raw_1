Given the issue with confusing assertion rewriting messages for byte strings and the identified relevant files, I'll propose a hypothetical patch. This patch aims to improve the clarity of error messages when comparing byte strings in assertions by explicitly indicating the byte values and their corresponding characters when possible. Please note, without direct access to the actual source code and based solely on the description of the issue, the following is a conceptual solution.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original code snippet where the AssertionError for byte strings is formatted
raise AssertionError(f"assert {left} == {right}")
</original>
<patched>
# This patched version aims to improve the error message by providing a clearer representation of byte strings
def format_byte_string_diff(left, right):
    diff = []
    for l, r in zip(left, right):
        if l != r:
            diff.append(f"{l} ({chr(l)}) != {r} ({chr(r)})")
        else:
            diff.append(f"{l} ({chr(l)})")
    return ', '.join(diff)

# Assuming 'left' and 'right' are the byte strings being compared
if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
    left_repr = ' '.join([f"{b} ({chr(b)})" for b in left])
    right_repr = ' '.join([f"{b} ({chr(b)})" for b in right])
    diff = format_byte_string_diff(left, right)
    raise AssertionError(f"assert {left_repr} == {right_repr}\nByte difference: {diff}")
else:
    raise AssertionError(f"assert {left} == {right}")
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a function `format_byte_string_diff` that generates a detailed difference string for byte strings, including both the byte value and its corresponding ASCII character (when applicable). The patched version checks if the compared values are byte strings and, if so, formats their representation and the error message accordingly to make the difference clearer.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase properly, including handling edge cases, ensuring compatibility with the overall error handling logic, and adhering to the project's coding standards.
