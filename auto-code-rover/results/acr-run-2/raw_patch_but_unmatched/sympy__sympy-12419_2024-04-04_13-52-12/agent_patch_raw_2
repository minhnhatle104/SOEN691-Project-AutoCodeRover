Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, where I cannot directly access or modify the SymPy codebase, and considering the hypothetical nature of the issue described, it's challenging to provide an exact patch without seeing the actual implementation details of the relevant methods and classes. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to addressing the issue based on common practices in handling such bugs in symbolic computation libraries.

### Conceptual Approach to Patching the Issue

The issue described involves the total sum of elements in an identity matrix being incorrectly evaluated as 0 instead of 'n'. This suggests a potential misunderstanding in the handling of symbolic summation over matrix elements or the application of assumptions (like orthogonality) in the evaluation process.

#### Conceptual Modification 1: Correcting Symbolic Summation Logic

**File**: `sympy/concrete/summations.py` (Conceptual Location)

**Original**:
```python
# This is a conceptual snippet; actual implementation details may vary.
def _eval_sum_symbolic(self, f, i, a, b):
    # Logic for evaluating symbolic sums
```

**Patched**:
```python
# Conceptually adjusted logic to handle identity matrices correctly
def _eval_sum_symbolic(self, f, i, a, b):
    if f.is_Matrix and self._is_identity_matrix(f):
        return f.rows  # Assuming 'f.rows' gives the dimension of the square identity matrix
    # Rest of the original logic

def _is_identity_matrix(self, matrix):
    # Conceptual method to check if a matrix is an identity matrix
    # Actual implementation would involve checking if the matrix satisfies the properties of an identity matrix
    pass
```

#### Conceptual Modification 2: Ensuring Assumptions Are Correctly Applied

**File**: `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` (Conceptual Location)

**Original**:
```python
# This is a conceptual snippet; actual implementation details may vary.
def refine(expr, assumptions=True):
    # Original refinement logic
```

**Patched**:
```python
# Conceptually adjusted refinement logic to ensure assumptions are correctly applied
def refine(expr, assumptions=True):
    if expr.is_Matrix:
        # Conceptual logic to handle matrix-specific assumptions
        if 'orthogonal' in assumptions and expr.is_square_matrix():
            return Identity(expr.rows)  # Return an identity matrix of appropriate size
    # Rest of the original logic
```

#### Conceptual Modification 3: Improving the Evaluation Process

**File**: `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` (Conceptual Location)

**Original**:
```python
# This is a conceptual snippet; actual implementation details may vary.
def doit(self, **hints):
    # Original doit logic
```

**Patched**:
```python
# Conceptually adjusted doit method to ensure correct evaluation
def doit(self, **hints):
    if self.is_Matrix and 'orthogonal' in hints:
        # Conceptual checks or transformations for matrices under orthogonal assumption
        return self.as_identity_matrix()  # Conceptual method to treat the matrix as an identity matrix if applicable
    # Rest of the original logic
```

Please note, these modifications are conceptual and intended to illustrate a possible approach to resolving the issue based on common patterns in handling symbolic matrices and assumptions in computational libraries. The actual implementation would require a detailed review of the SymPy codebase, understanding the specific mechanisms for handling matrices, summations, and assumptions, and then applying a fix that aligns with those mechanisms.
