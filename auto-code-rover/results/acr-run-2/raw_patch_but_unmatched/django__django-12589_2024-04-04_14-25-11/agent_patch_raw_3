Given the constraints and the nature of the discussion, it's clear that providing a direct patch to the original issue without access to the specific problematic code snippet is not feasible. The guidance provided aims to illustrate a general approach to resolving SQL ambiguity issues in Django ORM queries involving `Subquery` and `annotate`, particularly when interfacing with PostgreSQL. 

For issues related to ambiguous column references in `GROUP BY` clauses, the solution often involves ensuring that all column references are explicit and that the query's structure is such that PostgreSQL can unambiguously interpret it. This might involve explicitly specifying fields in `.values()` and `.annotate()`, and ensuring that subqueries are correctly correlated and ordered.

Since a direct patch cannot be provided under these circumstances, developers facing similar issues are encouraged to review their query constructions with these considerations in mind. Adjusting the query to explicitly specify and order by fields, especially in complex queries involving subqueries and annotations, can help resolve ambiguity and prevent errors.
