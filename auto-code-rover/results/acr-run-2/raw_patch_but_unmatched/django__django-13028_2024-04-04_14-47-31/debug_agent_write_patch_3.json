It calls `_filter_or_exclude` internally, which eventually leads to the invocation of `check_filterable`. This method is crucial for understanding how Django filters query sets and applies constraints.\n\n2. **`check_filterable` method in `Query` class**: The `check_filterable` method is designed to raise an error if an expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause. The method checks if the expression has an attribute `filterable` set to `True`. If not, it raises a `NotSupportedError`, indicating that the expression (or model field) is disallowed in the filter clause. This method also recursively checks if the expression has any source expressions (i.e., it's a complex expression) and applies the same filterability check to them. This is directly related to the issue, as the error encountered is a `NotSupportedError` from this method.\n\n3. **`ProductMetaDataType` class**: The search did not find the `ProductMetaDataType` class in the codebase. This could mean that the class name was mistyped in the search query, the class is dynamically defined or loaded in a way that the search could not detect, or there might be an issue with the search functionality itself. However, based on the issue description, we know that `ProductMetaDataType` has a `filterable` field, which is a `BooleanField`. This is likely what's causing the `check_filterable` method to raise an error when attempting to filter `ProductMetaData` objects by `metadata_type`, as the `filterable` attribute on the `ProductMetaDataType` model is being interpreted in a way that conflicts with the `check_filterable` logic.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from a misunderstanding or misuse of the `filterable` attribute within the `ProductMetaDataType` model. The `filterable` attribute in Django's ORM has a specific purpose related to determining if a field or expression can be used in filter operations. By naming a model field `filterable`, it inadvertently conflicts with this internal mechanism, leading to the `NotSupportedError`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, a potential patch would involve renaming the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` model to avoid conflict with Django's internal `filterable` attribute logic. This approach was hinted at in the issue description, where changing the field name to `filterable_test` resolved the issue. However, a more permanent solution would involve ensuring that model field names do not conflict with reserved attributes used by Django's ORM, possibly by prefixing custom fields with a unique identifier or choosing names that are unlikely to clash with Django internals."
