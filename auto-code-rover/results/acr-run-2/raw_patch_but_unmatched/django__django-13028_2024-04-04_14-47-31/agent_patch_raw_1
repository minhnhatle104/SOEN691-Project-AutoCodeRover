Since the issue arises from a naming conflict in the user's model and not from a bug in Django's codebase, the patch would involve changing the user's model definition to avoid using the name `filterable` for a field, as it conflicts with Django's internal mechanism. Here's how the patch for the user's model might look:

# modification 1
```python
<file>models.py</file>
<original>class ProductMetaDataType(models.Model):
    label = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True, blank=False, null=False)
    filterable = models.BooleanField(default=False, verbose_name=_("filterable"))
    ...
</original>
<patched>class ProductMetaDataType(models.Model):
    label = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True, blank=False, null=False)
    is_filterable = models.BooleanField(default=False, verbose_name=_("filterable"))
    ...
</patched>
```

This modification renames the `filterable` field to `is_filterable` to avoid the naming conflict with Django's internal `check_filterable` method. This change should be reflected everywhere the `filterable` field is used, including in queries, forms, templates, and possibly migrations if the project is already deployed.

It's important to note that if the project is already deployed, you'll also need to generate a new migration to reflect this change in the database schema. This can be done using Django's migration system with the following commands:

1. Generate a new migration to rename the field:
   ```shell
   python manage.py makemigrations --name rename_filterable_field_in_productmetadatatype
   ```

2. Apply the migration to update the database schema:
   ```shell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

Remember to update any code that references the `filterable` field to use the new `is_filterable` field name to ensure the application continues to function correctly after this change.
