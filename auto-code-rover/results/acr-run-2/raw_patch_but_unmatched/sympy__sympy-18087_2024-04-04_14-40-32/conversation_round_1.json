        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified three relevant pieces of information regarding the `trigsimp` function within the SymPy library:\n\n1. **Primary `trigsimp` Functionality in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`**:\n   - This is the core implementation of the `trigsimp` function. It describes the function's purpose to reduce expressions by using known trigonometric identities. The function supports different methods for simplification, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. The description also mentions that the function can simplify expressions recursively and handle common patterns. It provides an interface to other simplification routines based on the method specified in the options.\n\n2. **`trigsimp` Method in `sympy/core/expr.py`**:\n   - This method is a part of the `Expr` class, which likely represents expressions in SymPy. It acts as a wrapper or convenience method that delegates the call to the main `trigsimp` function in `sympy.simplify`. This suggests that any expression object in SymPy can directly call `trigsimp` on itself to attempt simplification.\n\n3. **`trigsimp` Method in `sympy/vector/basisdependent.py`**:\n   - This method is defined within the `BasisDependent` class, which suggests it's specific to vector operations or objects that depend on a basis. The method seems to apply the `trigsimp` simplification to each component of a vector or basis-dependent quantity.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem lies in the incorrect simplification of expressions involving trigonometric functions for general complex numbers. Specifically, the issue is with the simplification of `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` being incorrectly simplified to `cos(x) + sin(x)` under certain conditions.\n\nTo address this issue, the primary focus should be on the implementation in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, as this is where the core logic and decision-making for simplification occur. The bug might be related to how the function handles complex numbers or the assumptions it makes about the domain of the input expressions. It's also possible that the issue arises from the specific simplification method chosen (e.g., 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', 'fu') and how these methods deal with complex expressions.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve:\n- Reviewing the implementation details of the `trigsimp` function, especially how it handles complex numbers and the assumptions made about the expressions.\n- Investigating how different simplification methods ('matching', 'groebner', 'combined', 'fu') are applied to expressions involving complex numbers.\n- Testing the function with complex inputs to identify where the incorrect simplification occurs.\n\nThis analysis will guide the development of a patch to fix the issue, ensuring that `trigsimp` correctly simplifies expressions involving trigonometric functions for general complex numbers."
