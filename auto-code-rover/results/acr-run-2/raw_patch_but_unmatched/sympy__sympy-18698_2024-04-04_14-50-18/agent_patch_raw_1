Based on the provided context, it seems the issue at hand is related to the handling of polynomial factorization and specifically the square-free factorization (`sqf_list`) in SymPy. The issue description suggests that there's an inconsistency in how the library handles the factorization, particularly in the representation of multiplicities of factors.

Given the information, it appears that a detailed patch to the specific implementation of `sqf_list` in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` might resolve the issue. However, without a clear indication of the exact cause of the inconsistency from the provided snippets, the following is a hypothetical patch that aims to ensure the consistency of the output of `sqf_list` by revisiting how multiplicities are calculated and represented.

Please note, the following patch is speculative and should be validated for correctness and compliance with the rest of the SymPy library:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/polys/polytools.py</file>
<original>def sqf_list(f, *gens, **args):
    """
    Compute a list of square-free factors of ``f``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import sqf_list
    >>> from sympy.abc import x

    >>> sqf_list(2*x**5 + 16*x**4 + 50*x**3 + 76*x**2 + 56*x + 16)
    (2, [(x + 1, 1), (x + 2, 3)])

    """
    return _generic_factor_list(f, gens, args, method='sqf')
</original>
<patched>def sqf_list(f, *gens, **args):
    """
    Compute a list of square-free factors of ``f``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import sqf_list
    >>> from sympy.abc import x

    >>> sqf_list(2*x**5 + 16*x**4 + 50*x**3 + 76*x**2 + 56*x + 16)
    (2, [(x + 1, 1), (x + 2, 3)])

    """
    # Ensure that the method correctly calculates and represents multiplicities
    result = _generic_factor_list(f, gens, args, method='sqf')
    # Hypothetical fix: Normalize the representation of multiplicities
    normalized_result = normalize_multiplicities(result)
    return normalized_result
</patched>
```

Please note, the `normalize_multiplicities` function mentioned in the patch is a placeholder for a hypothetical function that would ensure the correct representation of factor multiplicities. The actual implementation would depend on a detailed analysis of how multiplicities should be represented and might involve adjustments in the underlying `_generic_factor_list` function or other parts of the `sqf_list` implementation.

This patch is speculative and serves as an example of how one might begin to address the issue based on the provided context. A thorough review and testing would be necessary to validate any changes and ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new problems.
