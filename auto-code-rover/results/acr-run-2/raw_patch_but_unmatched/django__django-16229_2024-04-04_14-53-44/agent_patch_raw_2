Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of the scenario, without direct access to the original program's code, I'll provide a generalized approach to crafting a patch for the described issue. This approach will be based on common Django patterns and practices. Since the exact code cannot be matched to the original program, these modifications should be adapted as necessary to fit the specific implementation details of your project.

### Generalized Patch for Handling Callable Defaults in Django Admin Forms

#### Modification 1: Ensuring Callable Defaults are Evaluated in Form Initialization

```python
<file>my_app/forms.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming the original form does not handle callable defaults explicitly.
</original>
<patched>
from django import forms
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

class RelatedModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def clean(self):
        # Existing validation logic
        raise ValidationError("whatever")
    
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Evaluate callable defaults
        for field_name, field in self.fields.items():
            if callable(field.initial):
                field.initial = field.initial()
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Forcing `show_hidden_initial` to False for Specific Fields

```python
<file>my_app/admin.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming the original inline admin does not modify the `show_hidden_initial` attribute.
</original>
<patched>
from django.contrib import admin
from .forms import RelatedModelForm
from .models import RelatedModel

class RelatedModelInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = RelatedModel
    form = RelatedModelForm
    extra = 1

    def get_formset(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):
        formset = super().get_formset(request, obj, **kwargs)
        for form in formset.form.base_fields.values():
            form.show_hidden_initial = False
        return formset
</patched>
```

### Explanation:

- **Modification 1** addresses the issue where callable defaults for form fields are not being evaluated upon form initialization. By explicitly checking if a field's `initial` attribute is callable and, if so, calling it to set the initial value, this ensures that callable defaults are correctly applied when the form is instantiated.

- **Modification 2** tackles the problem of the form's behavior upon resubmission, particularly after a validation error. By setting `show_hidden_initial` to `False` for all fields in the formset, it prevents Django from generating hidden inputs for the initial values of fields. This can help in scenarios where the presence of these hidden inputs might interfere with the correct handling of form validation and submission, especially for fields with complex data types like `ArrayField`.

Please adapt these modifications to fit the specific details of your Django project, including the correct file paths and any nuances in your form and model definitions.
