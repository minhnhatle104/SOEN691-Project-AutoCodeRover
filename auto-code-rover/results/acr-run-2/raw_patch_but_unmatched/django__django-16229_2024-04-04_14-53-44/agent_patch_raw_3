Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'll provide a conceptual approach to addressing the issue described, as I cannot directly access or modify the original program's code. This conceptual patch is meant to guide you through implementing a solution based on common Django development practices.

### Conceptual Patch for Handling Callable Defaults and Form Validation in Django Admin

#### Conceptual Modification 1: Update `RelatedModelForm` Initialization

To ensure callable defaults are correctly evaluated and applied:

```python
# Conceptual path: my_app/forms.py

# Original code snippet is not directly provided. Conceptual update:
class RelatedModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(RelatedModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        for field_name, field in self.fields.items():
            if callable(field.initial):
                field.initial = field.initial()

    def clean(self):
        # Your existing validation logic
        raise ValidationError("Custom error message")
```

#### Conceptual Modification 2: Force `show_hidden_initial` to False in `RelatedModelInline`

To address the issue with form validation being bypassed on resubmission:

```python
# Conceptual path: my_app/admin.py

# Original code snippet is not directly provided. Conceptual update:
class RelatedModelInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = RelatedModel
    form = RelatedModelForm
    extra = 1

    def get_formset(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):
        formset = super(RelatedModelInline, self).get_formset(request, obj, **kwargs)
        for form in formset.form.base_fields.values():
            form.show_hidden_initial = False
        return formset
```

### Explanation and Rationale:

- **Conceptual Modification 1**: This update ensures that if a form field's default value is a callable (e.g., a function or a lambda), it gets called and the return value is set as the field's initial value when the form is instantiated. This is particularly important for fields like `ArrayField` that may rely on callable defaults to initialize their data correctly.

- **Conceptual Modification 2**: By setting `show_hidden_initial` to `False` for all fields in the inline formset, this modification aims to prevent Django from generating hidden inputs for initial values. This can be crucial for avoiding issues where the form might incorrectly bypass validation errors upon resubmission, especially in complex form scenarios involving fields with callable defaults.

Please note, these conceptual modifications are based on a generalized understanding of the issue described and should be adapted to fit the specific implementation details of your Django project, including the correct file paths and any unique aspects of your form and model definitions.
