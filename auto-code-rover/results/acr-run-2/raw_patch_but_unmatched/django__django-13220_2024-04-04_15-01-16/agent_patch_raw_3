Given the nature of the task, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the instructions for submitting the patch. Since the task is to add new functionality (an `__eq__` method) to the `ValidationError` class, and there's no specific "original" code to replace, the format provided doesn't directly apply. However, I'll reformat the submission to clarify the intention of adding new code, without the need to match against an existing snippet.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/exceptions.py</file>
<original>
</original>
<patched>
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, ValidationError):
            return NotImplemented

        # Normalize messages for comparison, making them independent of order
        self_messages = set(self.messages)
        other_messages = set(other.messages)

        # Additional attributes comparison might be necessary depending on the use case
        return self_messages == other_messages and self.code == other.code and self.params == other.params
</patched>
```

This modification adds an `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class. This method enables comparison between two instances of `ValidationError`, considering them equal if they have the same set of messages (regardless of order), and matching `code` and `params` attributes. This approach addresses the issue described, facilitating more intuitive and effective testing scenarios involving `ValidationError` instances.
