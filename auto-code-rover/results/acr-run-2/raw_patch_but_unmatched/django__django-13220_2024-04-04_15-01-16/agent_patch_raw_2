I understand the confusion. Since the original request did not specify a particular code snippet to replace but asked for the addition of new functionality, the format for the patch should be adjusted accordingly. Given that the task is to add a new method (`__eq__`) to the `ValidationError` class without replacing any existing code, the format should reflect this addition rather than a modification of existing code. Here's how the patch should be presented in this context:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/exceptions.py</file>
<original></original>
<patched>    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, ValidationError):
            return NotImplemented

        # Normalize messages for comparison, making them independent of order
        self_messages = set(self.messages)
        other_messages = set(other.messages)

        # Check if both instances have error_dict and compare
        if hasattr(self, 'error_dict') and hasattr(other, 'error_dict'):
            return self_messages == other_messages and self.code == other.code and self.params == other.params
        # Check if both instances have error_list and compare
        elif hasattr(self, 'error_list') and hasattr(other, 'error_list'):
            return self_messages == other_messages and self.code == other.code and self.params == other.params
        # Fallback to comparing single message, code, and params
        else:
            return self.message == other.message and self.code == other.code and self.params == other.params
</patched>
```

This patch correctly adds the `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class in `django/core/exceptions.py`. The method is designed to allow instances of `ValidationError` to be compared based on their messages, code, and params. The comparison of messages is made order-independent by converting them into sets. This approach ensures that two instances of `ValidationError` are considered equal if they contain the same messages (regardless of the order those messages were added), and have matching `code` and `params` attributes, if present.
