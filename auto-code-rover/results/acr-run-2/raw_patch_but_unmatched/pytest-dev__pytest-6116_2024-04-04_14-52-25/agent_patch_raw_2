Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without the exact original code snippet where `--collect-only` is registered. The provided context does not include the specific code snippet for the registration of the `--collect-only` option, making it challenging to create a precise patch.

However, based on the standard practices in pytest and the information from the `addoption` method in both the `Parser` and `OptionGroup` classes, a general approach to adding a shortcut would involve modifying the call to `addoption` that registers the `--collect-only` option, including a short option in that call.

Since the exact location and code snippet were not identified, I recommend the following steps for someone with access to the pytest codebase to implement this enhancement:

1. Locate the exact place in the code where `--collect-only` is registered. This is likely in a file that deals with configuration or initial setup, possibly where other command-line options are registered.
2. Verify that the chosen shortcut (e.g., `-c`) does not conflict with existing options. This is crucial to avoid changing the behavior of pytest in unexpected ways.
3. Update the registration of `--collect-only` to include the new shortcut. If `-c` is available and chosen, the modification might look similar to the hypothetical example provided earlier, but adjusted for the actual parameters and context of the original code.

Without the exact original code snippet, creating a precise patch is not feasible in this scenario. Therefore, I recommend the steps above for manual implementation by someone with access to the full codebase and the ability to test the changes thoroughly.
