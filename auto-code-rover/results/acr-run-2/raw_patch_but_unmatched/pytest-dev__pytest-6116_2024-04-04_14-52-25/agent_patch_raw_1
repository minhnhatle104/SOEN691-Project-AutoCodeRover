To address the issue of adding a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option in pytest, we need to identify where the `--collect-only` option is registered and then modify that registration to include a short option. Based on the context provided, the `addoption` method in either the `Parser` or `OptionGroup` class within `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` is likely where this change needs to be made. However, the exact location where `--collect-only` is registered was not directly identified in the provided context. 

Given the standard approach to adding options in pytest, a hypothetical patch could look like this if we were to add a short option, say `-c` (assuming `-c` is not already in use for another purpose). Note that the actual implementation may vary based on the existing codebase and conventions within pytest.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py</file>
<original>
self.addoption("--collect-only", ...)
</original>
<patched>
self.addoption("-c", "--collect-only", ...)
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the `--collect-only` option is added using a direct call to `self.addoption` within the relevant configuration setup in `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` or a similar file. The `...` in the original and patched code snippets should be replaced with the actual parameters used in the `addoption` call for `--collect-only`, which were not specified in the provided context.

Please note, this is a hypothetical example. The actual implementation would require locating the exact place where `--collect-only` is registered and ensuring that the chosen short option (`-c` in this example) does not conflict with existing options. Additionally, it's crucial to update any documentation and tests related to the `--collect-only` option to reflect the introduction of the new shortcut.
