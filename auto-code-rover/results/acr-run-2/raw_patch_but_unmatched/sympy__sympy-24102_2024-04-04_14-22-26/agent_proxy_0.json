Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"mathematica\")`: This will help us understand if the `mathematica` function is part of a class that might have been modified or deprecated in the transition to `parse_mathematica`.\n\n2. `search_method(\"parse_mathematica\")`: Since the issue is directly related to this method, finding its implementation will give us insights into how it processes input and why it might be failing with Greek characters.\n\n3. `search_method(\"mathematica\")`: By comparing the implementation of the deprecated `mathematica` function with `parse_mathematica`, we can identify changes that might have led to the issue.\n\n4. `search_code(\"sympy.parsing.mathematica\")`: This will help us locate the file or files where these functions are implemented, providing a broader context of the module's structure and any related functionality that might be affecting the parsing process.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of the problem area, allowing us to pinpoint the cause of the issue and develop a suitable patch."
