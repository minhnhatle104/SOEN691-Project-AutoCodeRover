Given the limitations and the specific request for a direct patch that aligns with the existing codebase, without the ability to apply the previously suggested conceptual patches directly, I acknowledge the challenge in providing a concrete solution without exact matches to the original code snippets. 

However, addressing the issue with parsing Greek characters in `MathematicaParser` would conceptually involve enhancing regex patterns to recognize Greek characters, ensuring tokenization processes these characters correctly, and possibly updating translation mechanisms to handle expressions involving these characters appropriately. 

Since a direct code patch cannot be provided under these constraints, it's recommended for developers facing similar issues to review and adjust their parsing logic, regex patterns, and translation dictionaries to ensure comprehensive support for Greek characters and other non-ASCII symbols in mathematical expressions or similar parsing tasks.
