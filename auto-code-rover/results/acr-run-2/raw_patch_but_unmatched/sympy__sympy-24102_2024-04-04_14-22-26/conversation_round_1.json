        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we can draw several conclusions and identify potential areas to investigate further for resolving the issue with parsing Greek characters (and possibly others) in `parse_mathematica`.\n\n1. **No Class Named `mathematica`**: The search for a class named `mathematica` returned no results, indicating that `mathematica` and `parse_mathematica` are not class methods but standalone functions within the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module.\n\n2. **Implementation Details**:\n   - The `parse_mathematica` function translates a string containing a Wolfram Mathematica expression into a SymPy expression. It uses a `MathematicaParser` object to parse the input string `s`. The documentation and examples provided in the code snippet do not mention support for Greek characters explicitly, but they do show how the function handles various Mathematica expressions.\n   - The `mathematica` function is deprecated as of SymPy version 1.11, with a recommendation to use `parse_mathematica` instead. The deprecation warning suggests that any additional translations that were previously passed to `mathematica` can now be handled by using `.replace()` or `.subs()` methods on the output of `parse_mathematica`. This function also uses a `MathematicaParser` object but calls a method `_parse_old(s)` for parsing.\n\n3. **Potential Areas of Investigation**:\n   - The `MathematicaParser` class and its methods, especially how it differs between `parse_mathematica` and the deprecated `mathematica` function. Since both functions use this parser but seem to handle inputs differently, the implementation of the parser and its ability to handle Greek characters could be key.\n   - The handling of Greek characters and other special symbols in the parsing process. Since the issue specifically mentions the inability to parse Greek characters, examining how these characters are processed during the parsing could reveal the problem.\n   - The deprecation of `mathematica` and introduction of `parse_mathematica` might have involved changes in how strings are parsed or how characters are encoded/decoded. This transition could have introduced the bug.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps could involve examining the `MathematicaParser` class's implementation, especially focusing on character handling and parsing logic differences between `parse_mathematica` and the deprecated `mathematica` function. Additionally, reviewing any changes made to these functions or the parser class in the transition from SymPy version 1.10 to 1.11 could provide insights into the cause of the issue."
