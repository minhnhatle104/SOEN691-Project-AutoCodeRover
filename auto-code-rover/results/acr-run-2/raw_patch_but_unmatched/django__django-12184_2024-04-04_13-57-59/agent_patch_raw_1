Given the issue description and the constraints of our interaction, I'll provide a theoretical patch based on common Django practices and the details shared. This patch aims to address the problem of optional URL parameters causing crashes in some view functions after upgrading to Django 3.0. The patch will modify the URL pattern to correctly handle optional parameters and ensure the view function can accommodate these changes.

Please note, the exact file paths and original code snippets are not provided due to the limitations of our interaction. The following are educated assumptions based on typical Django project structures and the issue described.

# modification 1
```python
<file>your_app/urls.py</file>
<original>
re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
</original>
<patched>
from django.urls import path, re_path

# Handling the case where 'format' is not provided, defaulting to 'html'
path('module/', views.modules, name='modules'),
# Explicitly handling each format using re_path for backward compatibility
re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>html|json|xml)/$', views.modules, name='modules_format'),
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>your_app/views.py</file>
<original>
def modules(request, format='html'):
    ...
    return render(...)
</original>
<patched>
def modules(request, format='html'):
    # Ensure 'format' parameter is always a string to prevent TypeErrors
    format = str(format)
    ...
    return render(...)
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to:

1. **Split the URL pattern** into two distinct paths: one that defaults to 'html' when no format is specified, and another that explicitly captures the format. This approach simplifies handling optional parameters and makes the URL patterns more readable and maintainable.

2. **Ensure the `format` parameter is treated as a string** within the `modules` view function. This minor adjustment can prevent type-related errors when the function processes the parameter.

Remember, after applying these changes, thoroughly test your application to ensure that the issue is resolved and that the application behaves as expected across all specified formats and the default case.
