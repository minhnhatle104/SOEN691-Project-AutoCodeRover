I apologize for the confusion earlier. Given the limitations of our interaction, I cannot directly apply or test patches on actual codebases or receive real-time feedback on the applicability of provided patches to your specific codebase. My suggestions are based on the information provided and general programming practices, especially related to Django and database transaction management.

Given this, I recommend taking the concept of wrapping database operations within transactions to mitigate the "database is locked" issue and applying it manually within your environment. Here's a general guideline on how to apply the concept:

1. **Locate the `setUpTestData` method in your `tests/admin_views/test_multidb.py` file.**
2. **Import the transaction module at the top of your file:**
   ```python
   from django.db import transaction
   ```
3. **Wrap the database operations within the `for db in connections:` loop with a `transaction.atomic(using=db)` block.** Ensure that you're specifying the `using=db` argument to apply the transaction to the correct database.

Here's a conceptual example based on the provided snippets:

```python
from django.db import transaction

class MultiDatabaseTests(TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        cls.superusers = {}
        cls.test_book_ids = {}
        for db in connections:
            Router.target_db = db
            with transaction.atomic(using=db):
                cls.superusers[db] = User.objects.create_superuser(
                    username='admin', password='something', email='test@test.org',
                )
                b = Book(name='Test Book')
                b.save(using=db)
                cls.test_book_ids[db] = b.id
```

Please adjust the indentation and structure as necessary to fit your actual code layout. The key is to ensure that the operations that could potentially lead to a database lock are executed within a transaction block, which can help manage concurrency more effectively, especially with SQLite databases in a testing environment.

Remember to thoroughly test this change in your development environment to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing any side effects.
