Given the constraints and the error message indicating that the original program could not be matched with the provided patch, it seems there was an issue with matching the exact code structure or formatting in the original submission. Let's attempt a revised approach, ensuring that the patch closely aligns with the provided code snippets and adheres to the correct indentation and structure as per Python standards.

# modification 1
```python
<file>tests/admin_views/test_multidb.py</file>
<original>def setUpTestData(cls):
        cls.superusers = {}
        cls.test_book_ids = {}
        for db in connections:
            Router.target_db = db
            cls.superusers[db] = User.objects.create_superuser(
                username='admin', password='something', email='test@test.org',
            )
            b = Book(name='Test Book')
            b.save(using=db)
            cls.test_book_ids[db] = b.id
</original>
<patched>from django.db import transaction

def setUpTestData(cls):
        cls.superusers = {}
        cls.test_book_ids = {}
        for db in connections:
            Router.target_db = db
            with transaction.atomic(using=db):
                cls.superusers[db] = User.objects.create_superuser(
                    username='admin', password='something', email='test@test.org',
                )
                b = Book(name='Test Book')
                b.save(using=db)
                cls.test_book_ids[db] = b.id
</patched>
```

This modification introduces transaction management around the operations that interact with the database within the `setUpTestData` method. By wrapping these operations in a `transaction.atomic` block and specifying the database with `using=db`, we aim to mitigate the risk of encountering a "database is locked" error by ensuring that these operations are executed within a single transaction. This approach should help in scenarios where concurrent access to the SQLite database during testing leads to locking issues.

Please ensure that this patch is tested thoroughly in the development environment to confirm that it resolves the issue without introducing any unintended side effects.
