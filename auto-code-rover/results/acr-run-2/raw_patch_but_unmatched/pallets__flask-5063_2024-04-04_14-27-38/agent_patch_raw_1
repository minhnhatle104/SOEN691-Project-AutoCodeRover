Given the constraints and the nature of the request, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on Flask's typical structure and the information discussed. This patch aims to enhance the `flask routes` command to include subdomain information. Note that this is a conceptual solution, as direct access to the Flask codebase for the exact implementation of the `flask routes` command was not available.

### Modification 1: Enhancing Route Output to Include Subdomains

Assuming Flask has a CLI command handling file where the `flask routes` command is defined, we would modify the function responsible for fetching and displaying the routes to include subdomain information. This modification assumes the existence of a `show_routes` function or equivalent within a CLI command file, which is responsible for the output of the `flask routes` command.

```python
<file>flask/cli.py</file>
<original>
def show_routes():
    for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules():
        methods = ', '.join(sorted(rule.methods))
        print(f"{rule.endpoint:30s} {methods:20s} {rule.rule}")
</original>
<patched>
def show_routes():
    for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules():
        methods = ', '.join(sorted(rule.methods))
        subdomain = rule.subdomain if rule.subdomain else 'None'
        print(f"{rule.endpoint:30s} {methods:20s} {subdomain:15s} {rule.rule}")
</patched>
```

### Explanation:

- **Original Code**: The hypothetical original function iterates over the rules in `app.url_map` and prints out the endpoint, methods, and rule for each route.
- **Patched Code**: The modified version adds a `subdomain` variable that fetches the subdomain from each rule. If a subdomain is not specified, it defaults to 'None'. The output line is then updated to include the subdomain information.

This patch is conceptual and based on common patterns in Flask and Python. The actual implementation may vary depending on the Flask version and how the `flask routes` command is implemented in the codebase. The file path and function names are hypothetical and used here for illustrative purposes.
