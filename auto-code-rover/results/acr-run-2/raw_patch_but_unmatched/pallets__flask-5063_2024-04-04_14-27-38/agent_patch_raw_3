Given the limitations and the context provided, I'm unable to generate a precise and directly applicable patch for the Flask framework to address the feature request regarding the enhancement of the `flask routes` command with subdomain information. My previous attempts were conceptual and aimed to illustrate a potential approach based on common Flask patterns and Python coding practices. Without access to the specific implementation details of the `flask routes` command within the Flask framework, creating an accurate and applicable patch is not feasible in this scenario.

I recommend consulting the Flask documentation, exploring the source code, and possibly engaging with the Flask community for further assistance in implementing this feature.
