Given the context and the structure of the `Pipeline` class as shown in the provided code snippet, there is no specific "original" code to replace since we are adding a new method to the class. The instruction was to implement the `__len__` method, which was not present in the original class definition. Therefore, the patch would involve adding this new method to the `Pipeline` class to resolve the issue. Here's how the patch would be formatted considering the nature of the change:

```python
<file>sklearn/pipeline.py</file>
<original></original>
<patched>    def __len__(self):
        """
        Returns the total number of steps in the pipeline.
        """
        return len(self.steps)
</patched>
```

This patch correctly adds the `__len__` method to the `Pipeline` class, allowing users to use the `len()` function on `Pipeline` instances, which will return the number of steps in the pipeline.
