Given the context of the issue, the following API calls would be necessary to gather more information:\n\n1. **Search for the Pipeline class**: This will help us understand the structure of the `Pipeline` class and see if the `__len__` method is already implemented or if there's a place where we can add it.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Pipeline\")`\n\n2. **Search for the __len__ method in the Pipeline class**: This will confirm whether the `__len__` method is currently implemented in the `Pipeline` class.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"__len__\", \"Pipeline\")`\n\nThese searches will provide the necessary context to start working on a patch if the `__len__` method is missing or needs modification."
