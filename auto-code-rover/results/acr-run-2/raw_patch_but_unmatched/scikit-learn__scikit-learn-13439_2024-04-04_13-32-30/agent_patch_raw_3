I understand the confusion. Given the instructions and the context, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the request for a "patch" format. Since we are adding a new method to the `Pipeline` class and not modifying existing code, the traditional format of showing original and patched code doesn't apply directly. However, to clarify the action taken, here's a representation of adding the new method within the context of the class definition:

```python
<file>sklearn/pipeline.py</file>
<original>
# This section intentionally left blank as we are adding a new method.
</original>
<patched>
    def __len__(self):
        """
        Returns the total number of steps in the pipeline.
        """
        return len(self.steps)
</patched>
```

This addition introduces the `__len__` method to the `Pipeline` class, enabling the use of the `len()` function on instances of `Pipeline`, which will accurately return the number of steps contained within the pipeline. This method should be added to the class definition in the appropriate location, typically near other special methods like `__getitem__` for consistency and readability.
