Given the analysis and the context provided, the issue seems to stem from how the separability of left and right parts of a `CompoundModel` are combined. The original implementation does not account for the intricacies of nested models correctly. Without specific details on how the operators in `_operators` are defined and used, a precise patch cannot be provided. However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the issue.

The goal is to ensure that when combining the separability matrices of the left and right parts of a compound model, the operation respects the actual separability of nested models. This might involve adjusting how the matrices are combined based on the operation (`transform.op`) being performed.

# Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>astropy/modeling/separable.py</file>
<original>
elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
    sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
    sepright = _separable(transform.right)
    return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)
</original>
<patched>
elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
    sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
    sepright = _separable(transform.right)
    # Conceptual adjustment to handle nested CompoundModels more accurately
    # This might involve checking the nature of the operation (transform.op)
    # and applying a more nuanced logic to combine sepleft and sepright.
    # For example, this could involve a matrix operation that respects the
    # separability of inputs and outputs in nested structures.
    combined_separability = combine_separability_matrices(sepleft, sepright, transform.op)
    return combined_separability

def combine_separability_matrices(left_matrix, right_matrix, operation):
    """
    Conceptual function to combine separability matrices of left and right parts of a CompoundModel.

    Parameters:
    - left_matrix: ndarray, the separability matrix of the left part of the compound model.
    - right_matrix: ndarray, the separability matrix of the right part of the compound model.
    - operation: str, the operation combining the left and right parts.

    - ndarray: The combined separability matrix.
    """
    # Placeholder for conceptual implementation.
    # The actual implementation would depend on the specifics of the operations
    # and how they affect the separability of nested models.
    return NotImplemented
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch suggests adding a new function `combine_separability_matrices` that encapsulates the logic for combining the separability matrices of the left and right parts of a `CompoundModel`. The implementation details of this function would depend on the specific operations (`_operators`) and how they are supposed to affect the separability in nested models. The key is to ensure that the combined matrix accurately reflects the separability of inputs and outputs, considering the compound model's structure and operations.
