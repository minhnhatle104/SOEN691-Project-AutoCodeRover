Given the context and the issue at hand, the problem seems to be related to how the parsed LaTeX fractions are being converted into SymPy expressions, particularly in how the denominator of a fraction is handled. The issue is that the conversion does not correctly preserve the mathematical precedence when dealing with nested fractions, leading to a loss of brackets in the output expression.

However, without direct access to the specific logic within `convert_relation` or the definitions of `LaTeXLexer`, `LaTeXParser`, and how fractions are specifically handled within the parsing process, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. The parsing and conversion process likely involves traversing a parse tree and converting nodes into corresponding SymPy expressions. The issue likely lies in this conversion process, where the structure of the parse tree for nested fractions needs to be preserved more accurately in the SymPy expression.

A hypothetical patch would involve modifying the `convert_relation` function or a similar part of the code that handles the conversion of parsed LaTeX fractions into SymPy expressions. Since the specific implementation details of `convert_relation` are not provided, I'll outline a conceptual patch that aims to ensure that nested fractions are correctly converted into SymPy expressions with the appropriate use of brackets to preserve mathematical precedence.

# Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py</file>
<original>
# Since the original implementation details of convert_relation or the handling of fractions are not provided, 
# an exact original code snippet cannot be specified.
</original>
<patched>
# This is a conceptual patch and should be adapted to the actual implementation details.
def convert_fraction(parsed_fraction):
    # Assuming parsed_fraction is an object representing a parsed LaTeX fraction with numerator and denominator.
    numerator_expr = convert_relation(parsed_fraction.numerator)
    denominator_expr = convert_relation(parsed_fraction.denominator)
    
    # Wrap the denominator expression in brackets if it represents a complex expression, e.g., another fraction.
    if isinstance(denominator_expr, sympy.core.operations.AssocOp):  # This is a heuristic; the actual condition may vary.
        denominator_expr = sympy.parsing.sympy_parser.parse_expr(f"({denominator_expr})")
    
    return sympy.Mul(numerator_expr, sympy.Pow(denominator_expr, -1, evaluate=False), evaluate=False)
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch introduces a hypothetical `convert_fraction` function that ensures the denominator of a fraction is correctly wrapped in brackets if it represents a complex expression, such as another fraction. The actual implementation would need to adapt this logic to the specific way fractions are parsed and converted in the codebase, including the correct detection of complex expressions for the denominator.

Please note, to implement a real patch, one would need to closely examine the `convert_relation` function or wherever fractions are specifically handled during the conversion from the parse tree to SymPy expressions.
