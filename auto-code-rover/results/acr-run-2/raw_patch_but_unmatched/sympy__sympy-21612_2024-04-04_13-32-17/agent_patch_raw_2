Given the limitations in directly accessing and modifying the specific implementation details of the `convert_relation` function or similar, and without direct excerpts of the code handling the fraction conversion, providing a precise patch is challenging. The issue likely resides in the logic that converts the LaTeX parse tree into SymPy expressions, particularly how nested fractions are handled. A correct fix would ensure that the mathematical precedence is preserved by appropriately adding brackets around the denominator of a fraction when it is itself a complex expression.

Since we cannot provide a direct code patch without more specific details on the implementation of the fraction handling, the best course of action would be to outline steps for a potential fix and areas to investigate:

1. **Investigate Fraction Handling**: The developer should look into how the parse tree generated from LaTeX fractions is converted into SymPy expressions. This involves tracing the code from `parse_latex` in `_parse_latex_antlr.py` to where `relation` is converted into a SymPy expression via `convert_relation` or a similar function.

2. **Preserve Mathematical Precedence**: The key to fixing the issue is to ensure that when a fraction's denominator is itself a complex expression (e.g., another fraction), it is enclosed in brackets to preserve the correct mathematical precedence. This might involve checking the complexity of the denominator expression and wrapping it in brackets if necessary.

3. **Modify Expression Construction**: If the conversion process involves constructing SymPy expressions directly, the developer might need to modify this logic to check the structure of the denominator and apply brackets as needed. This could involve a conditional check around the construction of fraction expressions.

Without the ability to directly modify the code or knowing the exact implementation details, these steps provide a guideline for the developer to investigate and apply the necessary fix. The resolution would ensure that nested fractions in LaTeX are correctly parsed and converted into SymPy expressions, preserving the intended mathematical structure.
