Given the constraints and the nature of the task, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the pretty printing logic for the `Product` class within the SymPy codebase, it's challenging to provide an exact patch. The provided code snippet from `sympy/concrete/products.py` does not include the pretty printing functionality, which is likely handled in a different part of the SymPy library, specifically within the pretty printing module (`sympy/printing/pretty`).

The pretty printing functionality in SymPy is extensive and modular, allowing for customization and extension for various mathematical objects. However, without direct visibility into the implementation for the `Product` class's pretty printing, any attempt to write a patch would be speculative.

To truly address the issue, one would need to:

1. **Identify the Pretty Printing Function**: Locate the function or method responsible for the pretty printing of `Product` objects within the `sympy/printing/pretty` module. This could involve searching through files such as `pretty.py` or others within the same directory.

2. **Understand the Current Implementation**: Review the identified function or method to understand how it constructs the string representation of `Product` objects, including how it handles the top bar, the spacing, and the inclusion of an extra line at the bottom.

3. **Implement the Changes**: Based on the understanding of the current implementation, make the necessary adjustments to address the issues described. This could involve modifying how the top bar is constructed, adjusting the overall width of the printed object, and ensuring that no unnecessary extra lines are included at the bottom.

4. **Test the Changes**: Ensure that the modifications do not negatively impact the pretty printing of other objects or expressions. This would involve testing with a variety of `Product` expressions as well as other mathematical objects to ensure that the pretty printing functionality remains consistent and correct.

Given these steps and the speculative nature of any patch without direct access to the relevant code, it's clear that addressing the issue would require a more hands-on approach within the actual SymPy codebase.
