To address the issue with the pretty printing of the `Product` class in SymPy, specifically the concerns about the unnecessary extra line at the bottom, the "fatness" of the ∏ symbol, and the suggestion to extend the top bar for aesthetic reasons, we need to modify the pretty printing logic. However, the provided code snippet from `sympy/concrete/products.py` does not directly include the pretty printing logic. The pretty printing functionality in SymPy is handled by the `sympy/printing/pretty` module, particularly in files like `pretty.py` and possibly `stringpict.py` for string picture manipulation.

Given that the exact implementation details of the pretty printing for `Product` are not shown in the provided snippet, I will hypothesize a patch based on common patterns in pretty printing modifications within SymPy. This hypothetical patch assumes that the pretty printing logic for `Product` involves a function or method that constructs the string representation, including the ∏ symbol and the product expression.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet for pretty printing of Product
def _print_Product(self, product):
    ...
    for line in product_lines:
        pretty_result.append(line)
    pretty_result.append(bottom_line)
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patched code snippet with improvements
def _print_Product(self, product):
    ...
    for line in product_lines[:-1]:  # Exclude the last empty line if it's unnecessary
        pretty_result.append(line)
    # Adjust the width of the ∏ symbol and extend the top bar if needed
    top_line = top_line.replace('┬', '─┬─', 1)  # Hypothetical adjustment for extending the top bar
    pretty_result[0] = top_line  # Assuming the first line contains the top part of the ∏ symbol
    bottom_line = bottom_line.rstrip()  # Remove unnecessary spaces to reduce "fatness"
    pretty_result.append(bottom_line)
</patched>
```

Please note, the above modification is hypothetical and based on common patterns observed in pretty printing modifications. The actual implementation may vary, and specific adjustments may need to be made based on the actual code structure and logic in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` or other related files. To apply these changes, one would need to locate the specific method responsible for pretty printing `Product` objects in the actual SymPy codebase, review how the string representation is constructed, and then make the appropriate adjustments to address the issue described.
