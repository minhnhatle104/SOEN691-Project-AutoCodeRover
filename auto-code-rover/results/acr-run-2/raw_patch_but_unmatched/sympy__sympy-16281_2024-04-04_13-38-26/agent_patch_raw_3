Given the constraints and the nature of the task, it's clear that providing a direct patch to the existing code without access to the specific implementation details of the pretty printing logic for the `Product` class within the SymPy codebase is not feasible. The provided code snippet from `sympy/concrete/products.py` does not directly include the pretty printing functionality, which is likely handled in a different part of the SymPy library, specifically within the pretty printing module (`sympy/printing/pretty`).

Without direct visibility into the implementation for the `Product` class's pretty printing and the inability to execute or simulate search API calls or directly interact with the codebase, any attempt to write a patch would be speculative and might not align with the actual structure and logic used in the SymPy library.

To address the issue described, the following general steps would be recommended for someone with access to the SymPy codebase:

1. **Locate the Pretty Printing Logic**: Identify where the pretty printing for the `Product` class is implemented within the `sympy/printing/pretty` module. This might involve reviewing files such as `pretty.py` and others within the same directory.

2. **Review the Implementation**: Understand how the current pretty printing logic constructs the string representation of `Product` objects, focusing on how it handles the top bar, the spacing, and the inclusion of an extra line at the bottom.

3. **Make Necessary Adjustments**: Modify the identified pretty printing logic to address the issues described in the issue. This could involve changing how the top bar is constructed, adjusting the overall width of the printed object, and removing any unnecessary extra lines at the bottom.

4. **Test the Changes**: Ensure that the modifications do not negatively impact the pretty printing of other mathematical objects or expressions. This would involve comprehensive testing with various `Product` expressions as well as other types of expressions to ensure consistent and correct functionality.

Given these considerations, it's essential for someone with the appropriate access and understanding of the SymPy codebase to undertake the task of implementing and testing the necessary changes.
