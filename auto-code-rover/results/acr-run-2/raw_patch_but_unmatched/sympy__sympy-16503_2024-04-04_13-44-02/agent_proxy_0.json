Given the nature of the issue, it's likely related to the pretty print method for the Sum class or a related utility function that handles the formatting of mathematical expressions. Let's start by searching for the relevant class and methods:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Sum\")`: This will help us find the Sum class, which is likely where the pretty print functionality or its invocation is defined.\n2. `search_method(\"pprint\")`: Since the issue is with pretty printing, we should look for a `pprint` method in the codebase that might be responsible for handling the pretty print logic for various expressions, including the Sum operation."
