Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details and without specific code snippets from the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file or related files, it's not feasible to provide an accurate and applicable patch.

Creating a patch requires precise knowledge of the current implementation, including how the pretty printing of sum expressions is handled, how alignment is calculated, and how additional components like `+ 3` are integrated into the output. Without this information, any attempt at a patch would be purely speculative and unlikely to match the actual code structure or address the issue effectively.

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Implementation**: Examining the code in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` to understand how sum expressions are formatted and printed. This would include looking at how the components of the expression are assembled and how their alignment is managed.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: Pinpointing the part of the code that fails to correctly align the `x` and `+ 3` components of the sum expression. This could involve the logic that calculates spacing or the mechanism that assembles the parts of the expression into the final output.

3. **Developing a Solution**: Modifying the identified section(s) of code to ensure that all components of the sum expression are correctly aligned. This might involve adjusting the calculation of spacing, changing how components are concatenated, or introducing new logic to handle special cases.

4. **Testing**: Verifying that the changes resolve the issue without introducing new problems. This would include testing with a variety of sum expressions to ensure that the pretty printing works correctly in all cases.

Without the ability to directly inspect and interact with the codebase, it's not possible to proceed further in crafting a specific patch. If you have access to the code and can identify the relevant sections, I recommend following the steps outlined above to develop a solution tailored to the actual implementation details.
