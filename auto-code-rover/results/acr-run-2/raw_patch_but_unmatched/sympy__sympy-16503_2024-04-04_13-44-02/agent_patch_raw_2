Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file, it's challenging to provide an exact patch that matches the original program. The patch provided was hypothetical and aimed to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the alignment issue in pretty printing sum expressions.

In real-world scenarios, the development of a patch would involve reviewing the actual source code to understand the current implementation, identifying the exact cause of the issue, and then making precise modifications to address it. This process would also typically be accompanied by testing to ensure that the changes resolve the issue without introducing new bugs.

If you are facing a similar issue in a project, I recommend closely examining the code responsible for pretty printing, particularly the methods that handle the formatting of sum expressions and their components. Look for places where the alignment and spacing of elements are determined and consider how these might be adjusted to correct the alignment issue described. Additionally, consulting the project's documentation, developer guides, or community forums can provide valuable insights and guidance on making effective modifications.
