When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on \u200bdjango-users and was asked to report this here.\n</issue>"

Given the error message and the context, it seems the migration attempts to create permissions that already exist, leading to a violation of the unique constraint.\n\nTo gather more context and potentially find the source of the bug, we should look into the following:\n\n1. The migration file `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` to understand its logic and how it's attempting to update permissions.\n2. The model or method that handles the creation of permissions for proxy models, as the issue seems to be related to re-creating already existing entries.\n3. Any code that interacts with the `auth_permission` table, especially in the context of updating or creating permissions.\n\nBased on these points, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. `search_code(\"auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions\")`: This will help us find the migration file or any references to it, giving us insight into what the migration is trying to do.\n2. `search_method(\"update_proxy_permissions\")`: If there's a specific method handling the update of proxy permissions, this search will help us locate it in the codebase.\n3. `search_class(\"ProxyModel\")`: Since the issue mentions problems with models recreated as a proxy, finding the definition or usage of proxy models could provide clues.\n4. `search_code(\"auth_permission\")`: This will help us find all instances where the `auth_permission` table is being interacted with, which might show us where the duplicate entries are coming from.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."

This might suggest that the migration is part of Django's internal migrations and not directly exposed or modifiable in the project's codebase. This is common for migrations that are included with Django apps like `django.contrib.auth`.\n\n2. **Method `update_proxy_permissions` Not Found**: Similarly, no method named `update_proxy_permissions` was found. This could imply that the logic for updating proxy permissions is not encapsulated in a single method with this name, or it might be part of Django's internal mechanisms that are not directly accessible or named differently than expected.\n\n3. **ProxyModel Classes Found**: There are 8 instances of classes named `ProxyModel` found across various test files in the codebase. This indicates that proxy models are being tested extensively, which is relevant since the issue involves models recreated as proxy models. However, these are located in test files, which suggests they are used for testing purposes and might not directly influence the migration process but can give insights into how proxy models are handled or defined.\n\n4. **No Direct References to `auth_permission` Found**: The search did not return direct code snippets or references to `auth_permission`. This might be due to the query being too broad or the interaction with the `auth_permission` table being abstracted away by Django's ORM.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to be deeply tied to Django's internal handling of migrations and permissions, particularly how it deals with proxy models during migrations. The absence of direct references to the migration and the method involved in the error suggests that the solution might require a deeper understanding of Django's migration system and how it handles permissions for proxy models.\n\nTo move forward, we might consider the following approaches:\n\n- **Review Django's Migration System**: Specifically, how it handles permissions for proxy models. Since the direct migration file or method wasn't found, understanding Django's internal mechanism for this could provide clues.\n- **Analyze Proxy Model Handling**: The found `ProxyModel` classes in test files can offer insights into the definition and behavior of proxy models in Django. Understanding this can help in identifying why the migration might attempt to recreate existing permissions.\n- **Django Documentation and Source Code**: Since the issue seems to be with Django itself, reviewing the official documentation or Django's source code related to migrations and proxy models might uncover relevant information or similar issues.\n- **Community and Django Issue Tracker**: Since the initial issue submission mentioned not finding similar tickets, it might be worth revisiting Django's issue tracker with new insights or questions based on the analysis.\n\nThis issue appears to be complex, involving Django's internal behavior, and might require a multifaceted approach to fully understand and resolve."

This file contains custom migration operations, possibly including the logic that leads to the `IntegrityError` due to duplicate key values.\n\n2. **Permissions Handling in Django**: The extensive results from searching `permissions` indicate that permissions are handled across various parts of the Django framework, including models, migrations, admin, and auth systems. The file `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` appeared again in this context with 15 matches, suggesting that it contains significant logic related to permissions, specifically proxy permissions as mentioned in the issue.\n\n3. **Proxy Model Tests**: The search within `tests/proxy_models/tests.py` for `ProxyModel` usage provided examples of how proxy models are tested within Django. Although these are test cases and not directly related to the migration issue, they can offer insights into expected behaviors and configurations for proxy models, which might be relevant when considering how migrations handle these models.\n\n4. **ContentType Usage**: The search for `ContentType` yielded results across a wide range of files, including the migration file in question. This is crucial because the error message mentioned `content_type_id`, indicating that the issue might involve how content types are associated with permissions, especially in the context of proxy models. The `ContentType` model is a fundamental part of Django's content type framework, which is used to dynamically link models to permissions among other things.\n\nBased on this analysis, the bug seems to be located within the migration file `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py`. This file likely contains logic for updating or creating permissions for proxy models, which inadvertently attempts to create duplicate entries in the `auth_permission` table, violating the unique constraint.\n\nTo further diagnose and potentially patch the issue, the next steps would involve:\n\n- **Reviewing the Migration Logic**: Opening the file `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` and reviewing the custom migration logic within. Understanding how it interacts with proxy models and permissions will be key to identifying why duplicates are being created.\n- **Understanding ContentType Associations**: Given the involvement of `ContentType` in the error, understanding how this migration file uses `ContentType` to link permissions with models (and proxy models, in particular) will be crucial.\n- **Proxy Model Handling**: Although the tests for proxy models might not directly solve the migration issue, they can provide clues on the intended handling and configuration of proxy models within Django, which might inform a solution to prevent the migration from creating duplicate permissions.\n\nThis analysis points towards a need to closely examine the migration's handling of permissions for proxy models, especially in relation to content types, to identify and correct the logic that leads to the creation of duplicate permission entries."

To identify the exact methods or operations causing the issue, a manual review of the file is necessary."
