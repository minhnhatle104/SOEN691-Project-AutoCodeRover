Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific migration file `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` and its contents, I can only provide a conceptual approach to addressing the issue based on common Django patterns and practices. 

Since I cannot provide an exact match to the original program without seeing its content, I'll outline a general approach that could be adapted to fit the actual code you're working with. This approach will focus on ensuring that the migration does not attempt to create permissions that already exist, thus avoiding the `IntegrityError` related to duplicate key values.

Please adapt the following conceptual approach to your specific migration file:

### Conceptual Patch Approach

1. **Check for Existing Permissions Before Creation**: Modify the migration to check if a permission already exists before attempting to create it. This can be done using Django's `get_or_create` method, which will fetch an existing object or create it if it doesn't exist, thus avoiding the creation of duplicates.

2. **Update Existing Permissions if Necessary**: If the permission already exists but needs to be updated (for example, if its name has changed), the migration should update the existing permission rather than attempting to create a new one.

### Example Conceptual Patch

Since I cannot provide an exact match to the original program, here's a conceptual example based on common Django migration patterns:

```python
# Conceptual example; adapt as necessary for your migration file
from django.db import migrations

def update_or_create_permissions(apps, schema_editor):
    Permission = apps.get_model('auth', 'Permission')
    ContentType = apps.get_model('contenttypes', 'ContentType')
    
    # Example: Update or create a permission for a specific model
    model = apps.get_model('yourapp', 'YourModel')
    content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(model)
    
    permissions = [
        {'codename': 'add_yourmodel', 'name': 'Can add YourModel'},
        # Add other permissions as needed
    ]
    
    for perm in permissions:
        Permission.objects.update_or_create(
            codename=perm['codename'],
            defaults={'name': perm['name'], 'content_type': content_type},
        )

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        # Specify your migration dependencies here
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(update_or_create_permissions),
    ]
```

### Adaptation and Testing

- **Adapt the Conceptual Example**: Use the structure and logic of the example as a guide to adapt your `0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` migration. You'll need to adjust model names, permissions, and possibly other details to fit your specific needs.
- **Thoroughly Test the Migration**: Before applying the migration to your production database, thoroughly test it in a development environment to ensure it behaves as expected and resolves the issue without causing new ones.

This approach aims to provide a starting point for resolving the issue described. However, due to the lack of direct access to the original migration file and its contents, further adaptation and testing will be necessary on your part.
