            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` operates, particularly how it interacts with the `auth_permission` table and handles proxy models. Given the error message and the context, it seems the migration attempts to create permissions that already exist, leading to a violation of the unique constraint.\n\nTo gather more context and potentially find the source of the bug, we should look into the following:\n\n1. The migration file `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` to understand its logic and how it's attempting to update permissions.\n2. The model or method that handles the creation of permissions for proxy models, as the issue seems to be related to re-creating already existing entries.\n3. Any code that interacts with the `auth_permission` table, especially in the context of updating or creating permissions.\n\nBased on these points, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. `search_code(\"auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions\")`: This will help us find the migration file or any references to it, giving us insight into what the migration is trying to do.\n2. `search_method(\"update_proxy_permissions\")`: If there's a specific method handling the update of proxy permissions, this search will help us locate it in the codebase.\n3. `search_class(\"ProxyModel\")`: Since the issue mentions problems with models recreated as a proxy, finding the definition or usage of proxy models could provide clues.\n4. `search_code(\"auth_permission\")`: This will help us find all instances where the `auth_permission` table is being interacted with, which might show us where the duplicate entries are coming from.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."
