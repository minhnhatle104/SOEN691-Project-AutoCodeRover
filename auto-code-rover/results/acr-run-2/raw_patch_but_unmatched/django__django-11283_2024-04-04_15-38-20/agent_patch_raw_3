Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific migration file `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` and its contents, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. However, I understand the need for a conceptual solution to guide you through resolving the issue based on Django's migration and model system.

Since the exact content of the migration causing the issue is not available, I'll outline a general approach that should be adapted to the specifics of your migration script. This approach is based on the common cause of such issues: attempting to create permissions that already exist, especially in the context of proxy models.

### General Approach to Patching

1. **Ensure Idempotency in Migration Operations**: The migration should safely handle cases where the permissions it attempts to create already exist. This can be achieved by using Django's `get_or_create` method, which will either fetch an existing object or create a new one if it doesn't exist, thus avoiding the creation of duplicates.

2. **Handle Proxy Models Specifically**: Since the issue mentions proxy models, ensure that the migration correctly identifies and handles these models, especially since their permissions might be shared with or differ from the base model.

### Conceptual Patch Example

Please note, this is a conceptual example meant to illustrate the approach. You will need to adapt it to fit the actual logic and structure of your `0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` migration.

```python
# This is a conceptual example and may not directly match your migration file.

from django.db import migrations, models
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

def update_proxy_permissions(apps, schema_editor):
    # Assuming 'MyProxyModel' is a proxy model in your application
    MyProxyModel = apps.get_model('myapp', 'MyProxyModel')
    content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(MyProxyModel, for_concrete_model=False)
    
    # Define the permissions you expect to exist for this proxy model
    expected_permissions = [
        {'codename': 'add_myproxymodel', 'name': 'Can add MyProxyModel'},
        {'codename': 'change_myproxymodel', 'name': 'Can change MyProxyModel'},
        {'codename': 'delete_myproxymodel', 'name': 'Can delete MyProxyModel'},
    ]
    
    for perm in expected_permissions:
        Permission.objects.get_or_create(
            content_type=content_type, 
            codename=perm['codename'], 
            defaults={'name': perm['name']}
        )

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('myapp', '0010_previous_migration'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(update_proxy_permissions),
    ]
```

### Adaptation and Testing

- **Adapt the Example to Your Migration**: Modify the model names, permissions, and dependencies to match those in your project.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Before applying this migration to your production environment, test it in a development setting to ensure it behaves as expected.

This example aims to provide a starting point for resolving the duplication issue by ensuring permissions for proxy models are created or updated idempotically. Adjustments will likely be necessary to align with the specifics of your project and the migration causing the issue.
