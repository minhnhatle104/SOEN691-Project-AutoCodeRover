Given the context of the issue with the Django migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` and the error encountered, a direct patch cannot be provided without access to the specific codebase and the migration file in question. However, based on the common patterns of issues related to Django migrations and the description of the problem, I can suggest a hypothetical approach to address the issue of duplicate key value violations when the migration attempts to re-create already existing entries in the `auth_permission` table for proxy models.

Please note, the following is a conceptual solution aimed at guiding towards a potential fix. The actual implementation may require adjustments based on the specific details of your Django project and the contents of the `0011_update_proxy_permissions` migration file.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for the original code snippet that attempts to create or update permissions.
# Typically, this might involve iterating over a list of models and creating permissions for each.
for model in models:
    Permission.objects.create(codename=codename, name=name, content_type=content_type)
</original>
<patched>
# Import the ContentType model
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission

# Assume `models` is a list of model classes for which we're updating permissions
for model in models:
    # Determine the content type for the current model
    content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(model, for_concrete_model=False)
    # Define the permissions to update or create
    permissions = [
        {'codename': 'add_%s' % model._meta.model_name, 'name': 'Can add %s' % model._meta.verbose_name},
        {'codename': 'change_%s' % model._meta.model_name, 'name': 'Can change %s' % model._meta.verbose_name},
        {'codename': 'delete_%s' % model._meta.model_name, 'name': 'Can delete %s' % model._meta.verbose_name},
    ]
    for perm in permissions:
        # Check if the permission already exists
        obj, created = Permission.objects.get_or_create(
            content_type=content_type, 
            codename=perm['codename'], 
            defaults={'name': perm['name']}
        )
        if not created:
            # If the permission exists, update its name in case it has changed
            obj.name = perm['name']
            obj.save()
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the original migration script directly creates permissions without checking if they already exist, leading to the `IntegrityError`. The patched version uses `get_or_create` to avoid attempting to create a permission that already exists and updates the permission name if it already exists but with a different name. This approach should prevent the violation of unique constraints by not attempting to create duplicate permissions.

Remember, this is a conceptual solution. The actual implementation in your project may require adjustments, especially if the structure of your `0011_update_proxy_permissions` migration file differs significantly from the assumptions made here. Always test migration changes thoroughly in a development environment before applying them to production.
