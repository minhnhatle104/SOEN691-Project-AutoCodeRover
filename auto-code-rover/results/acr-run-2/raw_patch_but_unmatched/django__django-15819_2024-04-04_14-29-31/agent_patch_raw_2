Given the constraints and the nature of the request, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the `inspectdb` command's `handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`, it's challenging to provide an exact patch. However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the issue, which involves enhancing the `inspectdb` command to automatically generate `related_name` attributes for fields that are relations to the same entity to avoid clashes.

Since we don't have the exact code snippet where the relations are handled in the `inspectdb` command, the following is a hypothetical example that illustrates a possible approach to modify the command. This example assumes that there's a part of the code where the command iterates over database fields, determines if they are foreign keys or other relation types, and generates Django model field definitions accordingly.

# Hypothetical modification
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code where the field definition is generated
# This placeholder does not represent actual code from Django's inspectdb command.
field_definition = "models.ForeignKey(%s)" % related_model
</original>
<patched>
# Import necessary library
from collections import defaultdict

# Assuming there's a structure to keep track of relations to the same model
related_name_counter = defaultdict(int)

def generate_related_name(model_name):
    """
    Generates a unique related_name for fields pointing to the same model.
    """
    related_name_counter[model_name] += 1
    return '%s_related_%d' % (model_name.lower(), related_name_counter[model_name])

# Modified part of the code to include a unique related_name for ForeignKey fields
# Note: This is a conceptual patch. The actual implementation may vary significantly.
if field_is_a_relation:
    related_model = get_related_model_name(field)
    base_model = get_base_model_name(field)
    related_name = generate_related_name(related_model)
    field_definition = "models.ForeignKey(%s, related_name='%s')" % (related_model, related_name)
</patched>
```

This hypothetical modification introduces a function `generate_related_name` that constructs a unique `related_name` for each relation based on the related model's name and a counter to ensure uniqueness. This `related_name` is then incorporated into the field definition for relation fields.

Please note, this modification is conceptual and based on assumptions about the structure of the `inspectdb` command's implementation. The actual code in `inspectdb.py` will differ, and integrating this solution would require adapting it to fit the specific logic and structure of the `inspectdb` command's code for generating model fields from database schema introspection.
