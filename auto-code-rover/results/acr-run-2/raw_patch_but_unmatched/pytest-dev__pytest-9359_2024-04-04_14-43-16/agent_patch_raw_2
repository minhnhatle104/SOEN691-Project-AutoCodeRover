Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without specific details about the implementation of the `t` decorator or the exact configurations of pytest within your project, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. However, I'll offer a general approach to address common issues related to pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and compatibility with Python 3.9, focusing on best practices and hypothetical adjustments.

Since the direct application of patches requires matching the original program's exact code structure and context, which we do not have, the following suggestions are conceptual and should be adapted to fit the specifics of your project.

### General Approach to Address the Issue

1. **Review and Update Decorators**: If decorators like `@t` are affecting pytest's assertion introspection, consider reviewing their implementation to ensure they're compatible with pytest's mechanisms. This might involve ensuring the decorator properly wraps functions without interfering with pytest's ability to rewrite assertions.

2. **Update pytest and Plugins**: Ensure that pytest and all related plugins are updated to their latest versions. Compatibility issues between Python versions often get addressed in newer releases.

3. **Custom pytest Configuration**: If custom configurations or hooks are used, review them for compatibility with Python 3.9. Adjustments might be necessary to accommodate changes in Python's assertion handling.

### Hypothetical Patch for Decorator Compatibility

Since we cannot directly match the original program, let's conceptualize a modification to a hypothetical decorator that might be causing issues:

```python
# Assuming the original decorator interferes with pytest's assertion rewriting
<file>decorators.py</file>
<original>
def t(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
</original>
<patched>
from functools import wraps

def t(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
</patched>
```

This patch uses `functools.wraps` to ensure the decorator preserves the original function's metadata, which might help pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism recognize and properly handle assertions within decorated functions.

### Note

These modifications are speculative and aim to illustrate potential approaches to resolving issues related to decorators and pytest's assertion rewriting. Actual implementation details and the specific cause of the issue in your project might require a different approach. Testing any changes in a controlled environment before applying them to your project is crucial to ensure they effectively address the issue without introducing new problems.
