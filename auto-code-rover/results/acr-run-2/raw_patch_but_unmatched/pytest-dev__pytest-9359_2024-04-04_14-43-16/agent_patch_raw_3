Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to directly access or modify the codebase of your project or provide patches that exactly match the original program without specific details about the code structure and the implementation of the `t` decorator or the pytest configurations used in your project.

However, the issue described suggests a potential incompatibility or unexpected interaction between pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and the Python version upgrade (from 3.7 to 3.9). Since I cannot provide a direct patch without more specific details, I recommend the following general steps to investigate and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Review Decorator Implementation**: If the `t` decorator is custom to your project, ensure it's correctly implemented, possibly using `functools.wraps` to maintain the original function's metadata, which is important for tools like pytest that perform introspection.

2. **Update pytest and Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies, especially pytest and any plugins you're using, are up to date. Sometimes, compatibility issues are resolved in newer versions.

3. **Isolate the Issue**: Try to create a minimal reproducible example that demonstrates the problem. This can help in isolating whether the issue is with the decorator, pytest, Python version, or a combination thereof.

4. **Consult pytest Documentation and Issues**: Look for any known issues or changes in pytest related to assertion rewriting or compatibility with Python 3.9. The pytest documentation or GitHub issues may have relevant information or similar reports.

5. **Seek Community Support**: If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the pytest community or filing an issue with a detailed report and a minimal reproducible example. The community or the developers may offer insights or solutions.

Without the ability to directly modify your project's code or execute search API calls, these steps represent a high-level approach to troubleshooting and resolving the type of issue described.
