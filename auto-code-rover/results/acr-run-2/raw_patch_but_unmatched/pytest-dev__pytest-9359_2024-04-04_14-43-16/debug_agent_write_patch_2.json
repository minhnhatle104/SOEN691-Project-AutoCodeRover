It's possible that the issue is more related to how pytest handles assertions and error reporting, especially considering the difference in behavior between Python versions.\n\n2. **Numerous references to `pytest_configure` and `pytest_addoption` were found**: These references indicate that the project makes extensive use of pytest's configuration and option mechanisms. This is relevant because any custom configurations or plugins could potentially affect how pytest processes and reports test failures.\n\nGiven these points, the issue seems to be more about the interaction between pytest and the Python version (specifically Python 3.9) rather than a direct bug in the project's code. The difference in error reporting between Python versions suggests that the behavior change might be due to changes in Python's assertion introspection or pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism in newer Python versions.\n\n### Next Steps for Analysis\n\nGiven the complexity of pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and its interaction with Python's internals, the next steps should involve:\n\n1. **Reviewing pytest's documentation and changelogs**: Specifically, for versions compatible with Python 3.9, to see if there are any noted changes or issues related to assertion rewriting or error reporting.\n\n2. **Investigating Python's changelog between 3.7 and 3.9**: Since the issue does not occur in Python 3.7 but does in 3.9, it's crucial to identify any changes in Python that could affect how exceptions or stack traces are generated or reported.\n\n3. **Exploring pytest's issue tracker and forums**: To see if other users have reported similar issues when upgrading to Python 3.9. This could provide insights into whether this is a known issue and if there are any recommended workarounds or fixes.\n\n4. **Experimenting with minimal test cases**: Creating minimal pytest test cases that use assertions in a similar manner, without the specific project's code, to see if the issue can be reproduced in a controlled environment. This could help isolate whether the issue is with pytest, Python, or the specific way the project is using them.\n\nGiven the information at hand, it seems the issue is more nuanced and may require a deeper dive into the interaction between pytest, the Python version, and possibly the project's custom configurations or plugins."

However, I'll offer a general approach to address common issues related to pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and compatibility with Python 3.9, focusing on best practices and hypothetical adjustments.\n\nSince the direct application of patches requires matching the original program's exact code structure and context, which we do not have, the following suggestions are conceptual and should be adapted to fit the specifics of your project.\n\n### General Approach to Address the Issue\n\n1. **Review and Update Decorators**: If decorators like `@t` are affecting pytest's assertion introspection, consider reviewing their implementation to ensure they're compatible with pytest's mechanisms. This might involve ensuring the decorator properly wraps functions without interfering with pytest's ability to rewrite assertions.\n\n2. **Update pytest and Plugins**: Ensure that pytest and all related plugins are updated to their latest versions. Compatibility issues between Python versions often get addressed in newer releases.\n\n3. **Custom pytest Configuration**: If custom configurations or hooks are used, review them for compatibility with Python 3.9. Adjustments might be necessary to accommodate changes in Python's assertion handling.\n\n### Hypothetical Patch for Decorator Compatibility\n\nSince we cannot directly match the original program, let's conceptualize a modification to a hypothetical decorator that might be causing issues:\n\n```python\n# Assuming the original decorator interferes with pytest's assertion rewriting\n<file>decorators.py</file>\n<original>\ndef t(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n</original>\n<patched>\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef t(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis patch uses `functools.wraps` to ensure the decorator preserves the original function's metadata, which might help pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism recognize and properly handle assertions within decorated functions.\n\n### Note\n\nThese modifications are speculative and aim to illustrate potential approaches to resolving issues related to decorators and pytest's assertion rewriting. Actual implementation details and the specific cause of the issue in your project might require a different approach. Testing any changes in a controlled environment before applying them to your project is crucial to ensure they effectively address the issue without introducing new problems."
