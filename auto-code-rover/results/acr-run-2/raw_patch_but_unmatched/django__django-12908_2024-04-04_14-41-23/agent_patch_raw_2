Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct modification to Django's core files (`django/db/models/query.py`) to "fix" the behavior of `distinct` following a `union` operation is not feasible without potentially introducing breaking changes or unintended consequences. The behavior described in the issue stems from the inherent limitations of SQL and how Django's ORM translates queries to SQL, rather than a straightforward bug that can be patched with a few lines of code.

Therefore, instead of proposing a patch that directly modifies Django's `QuerySet` methods, which could have far-reaching implications, I recommend focusing on documentation or utility functions within the project to handle specific use cases. This approach avoids altering the Django framework itself and maintains the integrity and compatibility of the ORM with various database backends.

Since a direct patch to the Django ORM is not advisable without a comprehensive review and testing process by the Django development team, I suggest the following steps for the project team:

1. **Document the Behavior**: Clearly document the observed behavior when using `distinct` after `union` in the project's documentation, including the technical reasons behind it and any recommended workarounds.

2. **Provide a Project-Specific Utility Function**: If the project frequently requires performing `distinct` operations on the results of `union` queries, consider implementing a utility function within the project (as previously described) that handles this pattern in a way that's transparent to the developers using the project.

3. **Engage with the Django Community**: If this behavior is identified as a common pain point for many developers, consider opening a discussion on the Django Developers mailing list or filing a feature request on the Django project's issue tracker. This can help gauge the community's interest in enhancing the ORM's handling of such cases and might lead to a more robust solution in a future Django release.

By taking these steps, the project can better manage the current limitations while contributing to a potential long-term solution within the Django framework itself.
