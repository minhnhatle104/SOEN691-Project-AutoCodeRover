Given the context and the issue described, it seems the core of the problem is that `autodoc_type_aliases` is not being applied to variables and attributes documentation as expected. The provided code snippets primarily deal with functions, methods, and classes. However, the issue description specifically mentions variables and attributes, which suggests that the handling for these might not be directly addressed in the snippets provided.

Since the detailed code snippets do not directly show the handling of variables and attributes, and based on the nature of the issue, a hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that `autodoc_type_aliases` is also considered when documenting variables and attributes. This might involve extending the functionality of existing methods or adding new logic to apply type aliases to variables and attributes.

However, without a direct snippet showing where variables and attributes are documented, I can provide a conceptual patch that would likely involve adding or modifying logic in a place where variables and attributes are processed for documentation. This is a hypothetical example and might not directly apply without further context:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original code snippet where variables and attributes are processed
# but does not apply type aliases from autodoc_type_aliases configuration.
def document_variable_or_attribute(self, name, obj, **kwargs):
    annotation = get_type_annotation(obj)
    return f"{name}: {annotation}"
</original>
<patched>
from sphinx.util.inspect import stringify_signature

def document_variable_or_attribute(self, name, obj, **kwargs):
    # This patched version uses autodoc_type_aliases to resolve type aliases for variables and attributes.
    annotation = get_type_annotation(obj)
    # Resolve type aliases based on the autodoc_type_aliases configuration
    resolved_annotation = self.config.autodoc_type_aliases.get(annotation, annotation)
    return f"{name}: {stringify_signature(resolved_annotation, **kwargs)}"
</patched>
```

Please note, the above modification is purely illustrative and assumes the existence of a method `document_variable_or_attribute` which does not actually exist in the provided snippets. In reality, identifying the correct location to apply this patch would require a deeper understanding of how Sphinx processes documentation for variables and attributes, which might involve tracing through the autodoc extension's logic further than the provided snippets allow.
