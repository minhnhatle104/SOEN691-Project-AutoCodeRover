Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be provided without a more precise understanding of how Sphinx's autodoc extension currently handles the documentation of variables and attributes, and without a specific code snippet that directly relates to the issue at hand.

The issue revolves around `autodoc_type_aliases` not affecting variables and attributes as expected. The provided code snippets primarily focus on functions, methods, and classes, and do not directly show the handling of variables and attributes documentation where the application of `autodoc_type_aliases` is missing or incorrect.

Creating a patch would ideally involve identifying the part of the code where Sphinx processes documentation for variables and attributes and ensuring that `autodoc_type_aliases` is applied there. However, without a clear indication of where this occurs in the provided snippets, a specific and applicable patch cannot be accurately formulated.

For anyone looking to address this issue in the Sphinx project, the recommended approach would be:

1. **Deep Dive into Autodoc Logic**: Start by understanding how Sphinx's autodoc extension generates documentation for variables and attributes. This might involve tracing through the autodoc codebase beyond the provided snippets.

2. **Identify Missing Alias Application**: Once the relevant part of the code is identified, analyze why `autodoc_type_aliases` is not being applied to variables and attributes. This could be due to a missing check, an oversight in the logic flow, or because the alias application was only implemented for other elements like functions and classes.

3. **Implement and Test a Fix**: After identifying the gap, the next step would be to implement a fix that ensures `autodoc_type_aliases` is also considered for variables and attributes. This would likely involve modifying the logic to include a check for aliases when documenting these elements. After implementing the fix, thorough testing would be necessary to ensure that the issue is resolved without introducing new issues.

Given these steps and the complexity of the issue, addressing this problem requires a detailed investigation and modification of the Sphinx autodoc extension's codebase by someone with the ability to test changes directly within the project.
