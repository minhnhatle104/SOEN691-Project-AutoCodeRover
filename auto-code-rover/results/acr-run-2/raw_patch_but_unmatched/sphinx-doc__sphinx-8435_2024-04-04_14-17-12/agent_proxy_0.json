Given the description of the issue, it seems that `autodoc_type_aliases` does not affect variables and attributes as expected. To gather more context and potentially identify where the bug might be, we should look into the implementation details related to type aliasing and documentation generation for variables and attributes.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be helpful:\n\n1. **Search for the autodoc extension implementation**: Since the issue is related to `autodoc_type_aliases`, we need to understand how this configuration is handled. However, without a direct method or class to look up, we'll start by searching for code snippets that reference `autodoc_type_aliases` directly to find relevant functions or classes.\n   - `search_code(\"autodoc_type_aliases\")`\n\n2. **Search for variable and attribute documentation handling**: The issue specifically mentions that variables and attributes are not being processed correctly. Therefore, we should look for methods that handle the documentation of variables and attributes within the autodoc extension.\n   - `search_method(\"document_variable\")`\n   - `search_method(\"document_attribute\")`\n\nThese searches aim to find the relevant parts of the code that could be responsible for the issue, allowing us to understand the current implementation and identify where changes might be needed to address the bug."
