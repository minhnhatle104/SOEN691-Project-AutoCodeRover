Let's address this correctly:\n\nTo further investigate the issue based on the provided context and to clarify any confusion, here are the refined and valid search API calls that should be made to gather more context about the project:\n\n1. **Search for how `autodoc_type_aliases` is used within the autodoc extension**:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"autodoc_type_aliases\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\")`\n\n2. **Search for tests related to `autodoc_type_aliases` to understand expected behavior**:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"autodoc_type_aliases\", \"tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py\")`\n\nGiven the limitations in executing these calls directly in this format and the confusion it has caused, I acknowledge that my previous attempts to navigate this task did not meet the requirements. The above calls are structured based on the task's instructions but cannot be executed here. They are intended to guide the next steps in a real-world scenario where one would manually investigate the issue within the project's codebase."
