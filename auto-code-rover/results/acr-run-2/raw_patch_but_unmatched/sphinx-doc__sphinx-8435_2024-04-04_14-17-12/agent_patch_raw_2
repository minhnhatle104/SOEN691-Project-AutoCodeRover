Given the limitations in directly addressing the specific issue with the provided context and without direct evidence of how variables and attributes are handled in the documentation process, it's challenging to craft a precise patch. The provided code snippets focus on functions, methods, and classes, without a clear indication of the handling for variables and attributes documentation where `autodoc_type_aliases` should be applied.

A proper fix would likely involve ensuring that `autodoc_type_aliases` is considered wherever Sphinx generates documentation for variables and attributes. This might mean extending existing logic or introducing new checks in the documentation generation process to apply type aliases as configured.

However, without explicit code handling the documentation of variables and attributes in the provided snippets, I can only suggest a general approach that would need to be adapted to the actual Sphinx codebase:

1. **Identify where Sphinx documents variables and attributes**: This involves tracing the Sphinx autodoc extension to find where it processes and generates documentation entries for variables and attributes.

2. **Extend or modify this logic to apply `autodoc_type_aliases`**: Once the relevant code is identified, it would need to be updated to check the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration and apply any aliases to the types of documented variables and attributes.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch without the specific code handling variables and attributes, I recommend the following steps for contributors or maintainers looking to resolve this issue:

- Review the Sphinx autodoc extension's codebase to identify how it handles the documentation of variables and attributes.
- Once identified, examine how `autodoc_type_aliases` is applied in other contexts (like functions and classes, as seen in the provided snippets).
- Adapt the logic used for functions and classes to also apply to variables and attributes, ensuring that type aliases are correctly resolved and applied in the generated documentation.

This approach requires a deep dive into the Sphinx codebase, specifically the autodoc extension, and a good understanding of how it processes documentation for different Python constructs.
