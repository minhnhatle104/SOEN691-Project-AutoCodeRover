Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of the task, without direct access to the actual Django codebase or specific file paths and code snippets, creating a precise patch that directly matches the original program is challenging. The provided patch examples were illustrative, based on a general understanding of Django's structure and the issue description.

In a real-world scenario, to address the issue described, a developer would:

1. Locate the implementation of the `sqlmigrate` command within the Django project's management commands directory. This typically involves navigating the project's directory structure to find the specific file, which could be named similarly to `sqlmigrate.py` within `django/core/management/commands/`.

2. Identify the exact locations within the code where the decision to wrap SQL output in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` is made, based on whether the migration is atomic. This involves understanding how `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` are used within the command's logic.

3. Modify the logic to ensure that SQL output is only wrapped in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` if both conditions (`migration.atomic` is `True` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is `True`) are met.

4. Update or add tests within `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to cover the new logic, ensuring that the behavior is as expected when `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is `False`.

Without the ability to directly inspect and match the original program's code, the best approach is to outline the steps and logic required to address the issue, as done above. Developers working on the Django project would then apply these changes according to the project's specific implementation details and coding standards.
