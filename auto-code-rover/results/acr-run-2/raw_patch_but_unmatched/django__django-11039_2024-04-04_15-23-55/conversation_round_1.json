Here are the API calls that would be useful based on the information provided:\n\n1. To understand how `sqlmigrate` currently handles transactions, we need to look into its logic regarding the output transaction. Therefore, we should search for the `sqlmigrate` logic or function to see how `self.output_transaction` is currently assigned:\n   - `search_method(\"sqlmigrate\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that the `self.output_transaction` assignment needs to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well, we should look for where `can_rollback_ddl` is defined or used to understand its current implementation and usage:\n   - `search_code(\"can_rollback_ddl\")`\n\n3. The issue also suggests adding a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` based on an existing test for non-atomic migrations. To understand the structure of existing tests and find a suitable one to base the new test on, we should search within this specific file:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"non-atomic migrations\", \"tests/migrations/test_commands.py\")`\n\nThese API calls will help us gather the necessary context to understand the current implementation and how to proceed with the suggested changes."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we can analyze the context surrounding the issue and plan the necessary steps to address it.\n\n1. **`sqlmigrate` Method Not Found**: The search for a method named `sqlmigrate` did not yield any results. This suggests that `sqlmigrate` might not be a method but rather a command or part of a larger module or class that wasn't directly identified by the search. Given the context, it's likely part of Django's management commands, specifically related to migrations. The reference in the test snippet (`call_command(\"sqlmigrate\", ...)`) supports this, indicating `sqlmigrate` is indeed a command.\n\n2. **Usage of `can_rollback_ddl`**: The search for `can_rollback_ddl` found 16 snippets across various files, indicating that this feature flag is widely used across different database backends and tests. Notably, it appears in:\n   - Backend features for PostgreSQL, SQLite3, and the base features file, suggesting it's a configurable database feature that varies by database backend.\n   - The base schema file, which likely involves logic for handling schema changes and migrations, making it a critical point for implementing the suggested change.\n   - Several test files, including `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`, which is relevant for adding the new test as suggested in the issue.\n\n3. **Non-Atomic Migrations Test**: The search within `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` for non-atomic migrations led to the discovery of a test method `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration`. This test checks that transaction wrappers aren't shown for non-atomic migrations, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. This existing test can serve as a basis or reference for adding a new test that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and verifies the correct behavior of the `sqlmigrate` command under those conditions.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n\n1. **Modifying the `sqlmigrate` Command Logic**: Since `sqlmigrate` appears to be a command rather than a method, the modification should be made in the command's logic to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when deciding whether to wrap output in `BEGIN/COMMIT`. This likely involves editing the file where the `sqlmigrate` command is defined, using the information from the tests as a clue to locate it.\n\n2. **Updating or Adding Tests**: Based on the existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration`, a new test should be added to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`. This test should mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and verify that the `sqlmigrate` command's output does not include `BEGIN/COMMIT` transaction wrappers when it's not supported by the database backend.\n\nTo proceed, we would need to locate the file and exact location within the codebase where the `sqlmigrate` command is defined and then implement the suggested changes in both the command logic and the test suite."
