I'm unable to provide a direct patch to the Sphinx autodoc extension's source code due to the limitations of our interaction. My responses are based on general knowledge and cannot directly access or modify external codebases, including Sphinx. 

For issues like the one described, where annotated only members in a superclass are treated as "undocumented" by Sphinx's autodoc, the resolution typically involves modifying the logic that determines whether a class member should be documented. This often includes adjusting how inherited members are processed and ensuring that members with only annotations are recognized as documented.

To contribute a solution to the Sphinx project or any open-source project, I recommend the following steps, which align with common open-source contribution practices:

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**: Start by forking the Sphinx repository on GitHub and cloning your fork locally.

2. **Identify the Relevant Code**: Based on the issue description, the relevant code is likely in the parts of the autodoc extension that handle member documentation. This might involve files related to class processing and member inheritance.

3. **Develop a Patch**: After identifying the problematic code, modify it to ensure that annotated only members in superclasses are recognized as documented. This might involve adjusting how members are collected and filtered for documentation.

4. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your changes don't introduce regressions by running Sphinx's test suite. Consider adding new tests that cover the scenario described in the issue.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are tested and complete, push them to your fork and submit a pull request to the main Sphinx repository. Include a detailed description of the issue and how your changes resolve it.

6. **Engage with Feedback**: The Sphinx maintainers or other contributors might provide feedback on your pull request. Be prepared to engage in a constructive dialogue and make further adjustments based on their suggestions.

Given the speculative nature of this guidance, I encourage you to review the Sphinx contribution guidelines and documentation for more specific instructions on contributing to the project. Engaging with the Sphinx community through their issue tracker or forums can also provide valuable insights and support as you work on resolving the issue.
