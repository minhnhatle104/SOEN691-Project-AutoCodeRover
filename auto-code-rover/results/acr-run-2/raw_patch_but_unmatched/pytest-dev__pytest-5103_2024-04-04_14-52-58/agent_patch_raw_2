Given the constraints and the nature of the discussion, creating a precise and directly applicable patch without access to the specific implementation details of pytest's `assertion/rewrite.py` is challenging. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to how one might begin to address the issue of enhancing failure messages for `all` or `any` assertions within the pytest framework. This approach will be speculative and intended to illustrate the kind of changes that might be made rather than provide an exact patch.

Since I cannot provide a direct match to the original program without seeing the specific code, let's focus on a conceptual modification that aims to address the issue described:

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code where the assertion is rewritten.
</original>
<patched>
# Conceptual patched code to illustrate the approach of unrolling `all` or `any` for better error reporting.

def rewrite_assertions(node):
    """
    This function would be part of pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism,
    specifically designed to handle and rewrite assertions that use `all` or `any`.
    """
    # This is a conceptual illustration. The actual implementation would involve
    # traversing the AST, identifying assertions with `all` or `any`, and rewriting them.
    
    if isinstance(node, ast.Assert) and isinstance(node.test, ast.Call):
        if getattr(node.test.func, 'id', '') in ('all', 'any'):
            # Detected an assertion using `all` or `any`.
            # The idea is to replace this with a loop that checks each item individually
            # and raises a more informative AssertionError when the check fails.
            
            # Pseudocode for rewriting:
            # 1. Extract the iterable used in `all` or `any`.
            # 2. Replace the `all` or `any` call with a loop over the iterable.
            # 3. Inside the loop, perform the original check and raise an AssertionError
            #    with detailed information if the check fails.
            
            # Note: The actual implementation would require careful construction of the new AST nodes
            # to replace the original `all` or `any` assertion with the described loop and checks.
            pass

# Note: This is a highly simplified and speculative illustration of how one might begin to approach
# rewriting `all` or `any` assertions for better error reporting. The actual implementation would be
# significantly more complex and would need to integrate seamlessly with pytest's existing assertion
# rewriting mechanism.
</patched>
```

This conceptual modification outlines a speculative approach to enhancing pytest's handling of `all` or `any` assertions. The actual implementation would involve detailed analysis and modification of the AST nodes representing the assertions, which is a non-trivial task requiring a deep understanding of both pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and Python's AST module.

Implementing such a feature would also necessitate thorough testing to ensure compatibility with existing pytest features and to prevent any regressions.
