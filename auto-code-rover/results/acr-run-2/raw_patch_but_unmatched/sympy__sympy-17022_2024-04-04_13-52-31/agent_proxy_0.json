The issue description suggests that the problem lies in the way `lambdify` interprets the identity matrix symbol `I`. Therefore, we should look into the implementation details of `lambdify`, any relevant code printers, and possibly the handling of `MatrixSymbol` and `Identity` classes.\n\nLet's start by searching for the implementation of `lambdify` and any relevant classes or methods that might be involved in printing or interpreting matrix expressions:\n\n1. Search for the `lambdify` method to understand its implementation and how it handles expressions.\n2. Search for the `MatrixSymbol` class to see if there's any specific handling of matrix symbols that could affect the issue.\n3. Search for the `Identity` class to understand how identity matrices are represented and possibly printed.\n4. Search for code related to the code printer that handles matrix expressions, as the issue seems to involve how expressions are printed (`I` being interpreted as a complex number).\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"lambdify\")\nsearch_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")\nsearch_class(\"Identity\")\nsearch_code(\"code printer\")\n```"
