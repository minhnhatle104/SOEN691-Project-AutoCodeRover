Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I provided a hypothetical solution to illustrate how one might approach resolving the issue described. However, without direct access to the actual codebase and the specific details of the implementation, it's challenging to provide an exact patch that matches the original program's structure and syntax.

The proposed modifications were intended to demonstrate a general approach to catching `urllib3` exceptions and wrapping them as `requests` exceptions, based on common practices in Python exception handling. In a real-world scenario, the exact implementation would require access to the specific lines of code where `urllib3` exceptions are not being properly caught and wrapped, which was not available in this case.

If you are working on this issue within a real codebase, I recommend closely examining the locations where `requests` interacts with `urllib3`, such as in `requests/adapters.py` and during the request sending process in `requests/sessions.py`. Look for places where network operations are performed or where responses are processed, and ensure that exceptions from `urllib3` are explicitly caught and re-raised as the appropriate `requests` exceptions. This may involve adding try-except blocks around calls to `urllib3` methods and using the existing `requests` exception classes or creating new ones as necessary to accurately represent the errors encountered.

I hope this guidance is helpful, and I apologize for any confusion caused by the limitations of our interaction format. If you have further questions or another aspect of the issue you'd like to discuss, please let me know!
