Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, it's clear that providing a specific patch directly applicable to the actual codebase is challenging without direct access to the code and its current structure. My previous attempts were aimed at illustrating a conceptual approach rather than offering a precise code modification due to the lack of specific details from the actual implementation.

However, understanding the importance of addressing the issue where `urllib3` exceptions are not being properly wrapped by the `requests` library, the general advice would be:

1. **Review and identify the exact points in the `requests` library** where `urllib3` exceptions are likely to be raised. This typically involves network operations, such as sending a request or receiving a response.

2. **Implement exception handling** at these points to catch `urllib3` exceptions and wrap them in `requests` exceptions. This ensures that users of the `requests` library are exposed only to exceptions that are consistent with the library's design and abstraction.

Without the ability to provide a direct patch, I encourage reviewing the `requests` library's documentation on exception handling and the source code, particularly in files like `requests/adapters.py` and methods like `send` in `requests/sessions.py`, to implement the necessary changes.

If you're working on this within a project or as part of development work, collaborating with other developers or consulting the project's issue tracker or forums may also provide specific guidance or examples of handling similar issues.

I apologize for any confusion and hope this guidance is helpful in addressing the issue within the constraints of our interaction. If there are other ways I can assist or provide information, please let me know.
