Given the constraints and the nature of the discussion, it's clear that creating a precise patch without direct access to the specific codebase or the exact implementation details presents a significant challenge. However, I can offer a general approach to addressing the issue based on common practices in Python and libraries like SymPy for improving pretty printing functionalities. This approach should be adapted to fit the actual code and architecture of the SymPy library.

### General Approach for Patch

1. **Enhance Vector Representation for Pretty Printing**:
   - Ensure that vectors are represented in a way that is compatible with the pretty printing system, possibly by implementing or modifying a `_pretty` method within the vector class.

2. **Adjust Pretty Printing System**:
   - Modify the pretty printing system to better handle vector objects, ensuring that the baseline is centered and the representation is not broken.

3. **Review and Update Coordinate System Representation**:
   - If the issue is related to how coordinate systems are represented in pretty printing, adjustments might be needed in the classes responsible for these systems.

### Hypothetical Patch Approach

Since the exact code cannot be matched, let's discuss a conceptual approach that could be adapted:

1. **Vector Pretty Printing**:
   - For vectors, ensure there's a method that pretty printers can recognize and use to format vector objects appropriately. This might involve implementing a special method or ensuring compatibility with existing pretty printing mechanisms.

2. **Pretty Printer Adjustments**:
   - In the pretty printer implementation, ensure there's logic to detect and correctly format vector objects, taking into account their components and any associated coordinate systems.

3. **Coordinate System Adjustments**:
   - For coordinate systems, ensure that their representation is correctly handled in the context of pretty printing, which might involve adjusting how they are converted to strings or how they interact with the pretty printing system.

### Conceptual Patch Example

```python
# This is a conceptual example and not directly applicable
class Vector:
    def _pretty(self, printer):
        # Conceptual method to format vector for pretty printing
        formatted_components = [printer.doprint(comp) for comp in self.components]
        return "Vector: " + " + ".join(formatted_components)

class PrettyPrinter:
    def _print_Vector(self, vector):
        # Conceptual adjustment to handle vector objects
        return vector._pretty(self)

class CoordSys:
    def __str__(self):
        # Adjust string representation for better alignment in pretty printing
        return "Coordinate System: " + self.name.center(20)
```

This conceptual approach outlines how you might begin to address the issue by ensuring vectors and coordinate systems are formatted correctly for pretty printing. Actual implementation would require adapting these concepts to fit the specific structures and methods used in the SymPy library, following its coding standards and architecture.
