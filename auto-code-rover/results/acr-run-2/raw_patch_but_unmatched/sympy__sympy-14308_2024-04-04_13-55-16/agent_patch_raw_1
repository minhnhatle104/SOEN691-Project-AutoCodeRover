Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices for addressing pretty printing issues in Python, specifically within the context of a library like SymPy. This patch is speculative and aims to illustrate how one might approach fixing a pretty printing issue related to vectors and coordinate systems. Please note, actual file paths and code snippets would require access to the specific project's codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/vector/vector.py</file>
<original>
def _pretty(self, printer=None):
    # This is a simplified representation of what the method might look like.
    return "Vector representation"
</original>
<patched>
def _pretty(self, printer=None):
    # Use the printer's methods to format the vector properly.
    if printer is None:
        from sympy.printing.pretty.pretty import PrettyPrinter
        printer = PrettyPrinter()
    components = [printer.doprint(comp) for comp in self.components]
    return " + ".join(components) + " in " + self._system._name
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>
def _print_Vector(self, expr):
    # Hypothetical original method for printing Vector objects
    return str(expr)
</original>
<patched>
def _print_Vector(self, expr):
    # Adjusted to properly handle the pretty printing of Vector objects
    components = expr.components
    formatted_components = [self._print(comp) for comp in components.values()]
    return "{" + "; ".join(formatted_components) + "}"
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/vector/coordsysrect.py</file>
<original>
class CoordSysCartesian(BaseCoordinateSystem):
    def __str__(self):
        return self._name
</original>
<patched>
class CoordSysCartesian(BaseCoordinateSystem):
    def __str__(self):
        # Adjust the string representation to center the baseline for pretty printing
        return self._name.center(20)  # Hypothetical fix: center the name for better alignment
</patched>
```

These modifications are illustrative and based on general practices for addressing issues in pretty printing systems. The actual implementation would depend on the specific architecture of the SymPy library and the details of how vectors and coordinate systems are represented and printed. Before applying any changes, it's crucial to review the current codebase, confirm the exact nature of the issue, and test the modifications thoroughly to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new problems.
