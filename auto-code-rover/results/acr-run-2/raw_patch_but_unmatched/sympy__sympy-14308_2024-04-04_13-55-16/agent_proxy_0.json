Given the information in the issue, we will start by looking into the `CoordSysCartesian` class and the pretty printing functionality related to it.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `CoordSysCartesian` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that might be involved in the pretty printing process.\n2. Search for methods related to pretty printing in the entire codebase, as the issue might not be limited to a single class. Specifically, we're interested in methods that might be responsible for printing vector components or handling the pretty printing of expressions involving vectors.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_class(\"CoordSysCartesian\")\n- search_method(\"pretty_print\")\n- search_method(\"latex\")"
