Given the context and the need to correct the approach, let's directly address the initial task with a revised strategy for gathering more context about the project, considering the limitations and feedback provided:\n\nTo gather more context and potentially identify the location of the issue described, here are the revised search API calls that should be made:\n\n1. **Search for any usage of `ArrayField` within the `Profile` class across the project**:\n   - `search_code(\"ArrayField\")`\n\n2. **Broaden the search for the `Capability` class or its methods across the entire codebase**, since the nested structure might not have been correctly identified in the initial search:\n   - `search_class(\"Capability\")`\n   - `search_method(\"default\")`\n\nThese calls are designed to broaden the search scope to potentially capture relevant code snippets or class/method definitions that were not identified through the initial, more specific search parameters. By searching for these elements more broadly, we may uncover additional context or clues about the structure of the `Profile` class, the nested `Capability` class, and the usage of the `ArrayField` that could help in resolving the issue described."
