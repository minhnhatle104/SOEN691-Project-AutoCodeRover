Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific code snippets or file paths, creating an exact patch is challenging. However, I'll provide a generalized approach to address the issue based on common Django practices and the details provided in the issue description. This approach should be adapted to fit the actual code structure and file paths in your project.

# Hypothetical Patch

Since the exact code and file path cannot be matched to the original program, let's focus on the conceptual solution that addresses the core issue: ensuring that Django migrations correctly reference a default method from a nested class within a model.

The issue stems from Django's migration system not correctly resolving the reference to the `default` method of the nested `Capability` class when generating migrations. A common workaround for such scenarios involves defining the default method at the module level or directly within the model but outside any nested classes, and then referencing it using a string path in the migration.

```python
# Assuming the file path based on the context provided:
<file>your_app/models.py</file>
<original>
# This original snippet is based on the issue description and assumes the structure of the Profile model.
class Profile(models.Model):
    class Capability(models.TextChoices):
        BASIC = ("BASIC", "Basic")
        PROFESSIONAL = ("PROFESSIONAL", "Professional")

    @classmethod
    def default(cls) -> list[str]:
        return [cls.BASIC]

    capabilities = ArrayField(
        models.CharField(choices=Capability.choices, max_length=30, blank=True),
        null=True,
        default=Capability.default
    )
</original>
<patched>
# Adjusted model definition with the default method moved outside the nested class.
# Note: The actual implementation may need to be adjusted based on the specific project structure.

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField

class Profile(models.Model):
    class Capability(models.TextChoices):
        BASIC = ("BASIC", "Basic")
        PROFESSIONAL = ("PROFESSIONAL", "Professional")

# Moved the default method outside of the nested class to ensure it's correctly referenced in migrations.
def default_capability():
    return [Profile.Capability.BASIC.value]

class Profile(models.Model):
    capabilities = ArrayField(
        models.CharField(max_length=30, blank=True, choices=Capability.choices),
        null=True,
        default='app_name.models.default_capability'  # Adjusted to use a string reference
    )
</patched>
```

This patch moves the `default` method outside of the nested `Capability` class and updates the `default` attribute of the `capabilities` field to use a string reference to the method. This approach is more compatible with Django's migration system, which sometimes struggles with resolving references to methods within nested classes.

Please replace `app_name` with the actual name of your Django application. Also, ensure that the file path and class structure are correctly adapted to fit your project's specific setup.
