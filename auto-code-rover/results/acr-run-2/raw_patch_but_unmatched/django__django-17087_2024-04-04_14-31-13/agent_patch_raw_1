Given the context retrieved and the nature of the issue described, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on the common patterns and practices in Django models and migrations, especially concerning the use of `ArrayField` and default values. Since the exact code snippets and file paths were not identified, this patch is conceptual and aims to address the described issue in a general sense.

The issue involves a migration error due to the incorrect reference to a class method (`default`) from a nested class (`Capability`) within a model (`Profile`). The correct implementation should ensure that the migration references the `default` method in a way that is recognized by Django's migration system.

```python
<file>tests/postgres_tests/models.py</file>
<original>
class Profile(models.Model):
    class Capability(models.TextChoices):
        BASIC = ("BASIC", "Basic")
        PROFESSIONAL = ("PROFESSIONAL", "Professional")

    @classmethod
    def default(cls) -> list[str]:
        return [cls.BASIC]

    capabilities = ArrayField(
        models.CharField(choices=Capability.choices, max_length=30, blank=True),
        null=True,
        default=Capability.default
    )
</original>
<patched>
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField

class Profile(models.Model):
    class Capability(models.TextChoices):
        BASIC = ("BASIC", "Basic")
        PROFESSIONAL = ("PROFESSIONAL", "Professional")

    # Moved the default method outside of the nested class and adjusted its reference
    @classmethod
    def default_capabilities(cls) -> list[str]:
        return [cls.Capability.BASIC.value]

    capabilities = ArrayField(
        models.CharField(choices=Capability.choices, max_length=30, blank=True),
        null=True,
        default="appname.models.Profile.default_capabilities"  # Use a string reference
    )
</patched>
```

This modification moves the `default` method outside of the nested `Capability` class to the `Profile` model class and renames it to `default_capabilities` to clarify its purpose. The `default` attribute of the `capabilities` field is then updated to use a string reference to the method, which is the recommended approach for referencing model methods in Django migrations. This should resolve the migration error by ensuring the `default` method is correctly recognized and callable during migrations.

Please note, the `<file>` path provided is hypothetical and based on the context of the issue. The actual file path might differ in the project. Additionally, the `appname` in the string reference should be replaced with the actual application name where the `Profile` model is defined.
