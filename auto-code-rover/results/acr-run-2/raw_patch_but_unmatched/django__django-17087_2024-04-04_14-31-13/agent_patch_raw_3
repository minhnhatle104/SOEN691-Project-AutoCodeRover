Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch that matches the original program's exact code and structure. My responses are based on the information provided and general practices in Django development. Without access to the actual codebase or the ability to execute real search API calls, I can only offer a conceptual solution to the issue described.

To address the issue within the constraints of our interaction, I recommend the following steps based on Django best practices and the details provided:

1. **Refactor the `default` method placement**: Move the `default` method outside of the nested `Capability` class to ensure it's accessible in a way that Django's migration system can reliably reference.

2. **Use a string reference for the `default` method in migrations**: When specifying the `default` method for the `ArrayField` in your model, use a string path instead of a direct method reference. This approach helps avoid issues with migrations not being able to resolve the method location.

While I cannot provide an exact patch matching your original program, the conceptual approach to solving the issue involves these adjustments. You would need to adapt this guidance to fit the specific structure and naming conventions of your Django project.

For any Django project facing similar issues, it's crucial to ensure that any method used as a default value in model fields is easily accessible and correctly referenced within migrations. This often means avoiding nesting such methods within classes or using string paths to reference them in your model definitions.

I hope this guidance is helpful in addressing the issue, even though a direct patch cannot be provided. If you have access to the codebase and can make these adjustments, it should help resolve the migration error you're encountering.
