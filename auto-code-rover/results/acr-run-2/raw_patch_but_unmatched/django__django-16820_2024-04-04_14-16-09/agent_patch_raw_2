Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to directly access or modify the actual Django codebase or any other real-world project's source code. Therefore, creating a precise patch that matches the original program's code without seeing the specific implementation details is challenging. 

However, I can guide you on a general approach to addressing the issue based on standard practices for handling deprecation warnings and transitioning between different methods of specifying database indexes in Django models.

The goal would be to modify the migration system to automatically convert `index_together` definitions into `Meta.indexes` during the migration squashing process, and ensure that this conversion does not trigger deprecation warnings.

Since I cannot provide an exact patch without access to the specific implementation details, here's a conceptual approach:

1. **Identify where `index_together` is processed during migration creation and squashing.** This likely involves the migration's `__init__` method or a method specifically designed to handle model options.

2. **Implement a conversion method in the migration class.** This method would convert `index_together` definitions into the equivalent `Meta.indexes` format.

3. **Adjust the squashing mechanism to use the new conversion method.** Ensure that when migrations are squashed, any usage of `index_together` is converted to `Meta.indexes` before the final squashed migration is generated.

4. **Update any deprecation warnings related to `index_together`.** Ensure that the system guides users towards using `Meta.indexes` directly in new migrations.

Without the ability to apply a patch directly, I recommend reviewing Django's contribution guidelines, the migrations framework documentation, and possibly discussing the issue on Django's official forums or issue trackers for more targeted advice.

This approach requires a deep understanding of Django's migrations framework and should be tested thoroughly to ensure compatibility with existing migrations and the overall stability of the migration system.
