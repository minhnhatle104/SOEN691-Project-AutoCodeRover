Given the context and the issue described, I'll provide a hypothetical patch to address the problem of `translation.E004` being raised incorrectly for sublanguages when a base language is available. This patch aims to modify the system check in Django that validates the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting against the `LANGUAGES` setting, allowing for sublanguages to be considered valid when their base language is available.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and based on the information provided. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full Django codebase and testing.

```python
<file>django/core/checks/translation.py</file>
<original>
if settings.LANGUAGE_CODE not in [lang_code for lang_code, lang_name in settings.LANGUAGES]:
    errors.append(
        Error(
            'You have provided a value for the LANGUAGE_CODE setting that is not in '
            'the LANGUAGES setting.',
            id='translation.E004',
        )
    )
</original>
<patched>
base_language_code = settings.LANGUAGE_CODE.split('-')[0]
if not any(lang_code for lang_code, lang_name in settings.LANGUAGES if lang_code == settings.LANGUAGE_CODE or lang_code == base_language_code):
    errors.append(
        Error(
            'You have provided a value for the LANGUAGE_CODE setting that is not in '
            'the LANGUAGES setting or its base language is not available.',
            id='translation.E004',
        )
    )
</patched>
```

This patch modifies the check to split the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting value by '-' and extract the base language code. It then checks if either the exact `LANGUAGE_CODE` or its base language is present in the `LANGUAGES` setting. If neither is found, it raises the `translation.E004` error. This approach allows for sublanguages (like 'de-at') to be considered valid when their base language ('de') is available in the `LANGUAGES` setting, addressing the issue described.
