I'm here to provide guidance and suggestions based on the information shared with me. However, without direct access to the specific source code or the ability to interact with the Sphinx project's codebase, I cannot create a precise patch that would directly address the issue described.

For issues related to Sphinx's autodoc extension and specifically the handling of `*args` and `**kwargs` with `autodoc_typehints = "description"`, the resolution typically involves understanding the Sphinx source code and potentially contributing a fix to the project. This process would include identifying the part of the code responsible for the duplication issue, making the necessary corrections, and testing the changes to ensure they resolve the problem without introducing new issues.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch or edits that can be parsed and applied to the program, I recommend the following steps for contributing a solution to the Sphinx project:

1. **Fork and Clone the Sphinx Repository**: Start by forking the Sphinx repository on GitHub and cloning your fork locally to make changes.

2. **Identify the Relevant Source Files**: Based on the issue description, the relevant source files are likely those involved with the autodoc extension and type hint processing. This might include files within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/` directory.

3. **Develop a Fix**: Modify the code to ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled correctly when `autodoc_typehints = "description"` is set. This may involve preventing the duplication of these parameters in the generated documentation.

4. **Test Your Changes**: It's crucial to test your changes against a variety of Sphinx projects to ensure that the fix works as expected and does not introduce new issues.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've tested your changes and are confident they resolve the issue, submit a pull request to the Sphinx project with a detailed description of the problem and your solution.

6. **Engage with the Community**: Be prepared to engage with the Sphinx community during the review process of your pull request. The maintainers may request further changes or provide feedback on your solution.

While I can provide this guidance on the steps to take, the actual implementation and testing of the fix would need to be carried out by someone with access to the Sphinx codebase and the ability to test the changes in a live environment.
