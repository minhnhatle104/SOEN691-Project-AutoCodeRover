Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to directly access or modify actual source code files or provide precise edits that match the original program's implementation, especially for external projects like Sphinx. My responses are based on hypothetical scenarios and general programming knowledge, aiming to guide or suggest possible approaches to solving software development issues.

For the specific issue with Sphinx's autodoc extension and handling of `*args` and `**kwargs`, I recommend the following steps to anyone looking to create a patch:

1. **Identify the Source File**: Locate the source file within the Sphinx project that handles the parsing and formatting of function signatures for the autodoc extension. This might involve files related to autodoc processing, such as those handling directive processing or docstring parsing.

2. **Understand the Current Implementation**: Review the current implementation to understand how `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled, especially in the context of the `autodoc_typehints = 'description'` setting.

3. **Develop a Fix**: Based on the understanding of the issue (duplicated `*args` and `**kwargs`), develop a fix that ensures these arguments are processed and documented correctly without duplication. This might involve adjusting how arguments are collected, formatted, or added to the documentation output.

4. **Test the Patch**: Thoroughly test the patch to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems. This should include testing with a variety of function signatures to ensure `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled correctly in all cases.

5. **Contribute Back**: If the patch successfully resolves the issue, consider contributing it back to the Sphinx project through their contribution process, including providing a detailed explanation of the issue and the fix.

Without the ability to provide a direct patch that matches the original program, these steps offer a general approach to addressing issues within external projects like Sphinx. Engaging with the project's community, such as through issue trackers or discussion forums, can also provide valuable insights and support in developing and validating a fix.
