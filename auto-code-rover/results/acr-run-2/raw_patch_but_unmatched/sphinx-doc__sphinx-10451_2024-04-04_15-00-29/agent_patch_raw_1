Given the nature of the issue with Sphinx's autodoc extension and the lack of direct access to the specific source code or file paths where the bug might be located, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices in addressing issues related to documentation generation and handling of `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python. This example assumes that the problem might be related to the way Sphinx autodoc extension processes function signatures for documentation.

Please note, the actual files and code snippets would depend on the current implementation of the Sphinx autodoc extension, which I cannot access. Therefore, the following is a conceptual guide intended to illustrate how one might approach fixing the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the generated documentation.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
def format_args(self):
    # Example original method that formats function arguments for documentation
    args = inspect.getfullargspec(self.object).args
    if self.object.varargs:
        args.append('*' + self.object.varargs)
    if self.object.varkw:
        args.append('**' + self.object.varkw)
    # This might lead to duplication if not handled properly
    return '(' + ', '.join(args) + ')'
</original>
<patched>
def format_args(self):
    # Updated method to handle *args and **kwargs without duplication
    args = inspect.getfullargspec(self.object).args
    if self.object.varargs and ('*' + self.object.varargs) not in args:
        args.append('*' + self.object.varargs)
    if self.object.varkw and ('**' + self.object.varkw) not in args:
        args.append('**' + self.object.varkw)
    # Ensures *args and **kwargs are included once
    return '(' + ', '.join(args) + ')'
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/util/docstrings.py</file>
<original>
def prepare_docstring(s):
    # Hypothetical function that prepares docstrings for processing
    # This is a simplified example and may not reflect actual Sphinx code
    lines = s.split('\n')
    # Process lines to format docstrings
    return lines
</original>
<patched>
def prepare_docstring(s):
    # Updated function to ensure *args and **kwargs are handled correctly in docstrings
    lines = s.split('\n')
    # New logic to remove duplicated lines for *args and **kwargs if necessary
    processed_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if '*args' not in line and '**kwargs' not in line or line not in processed_lines:
            processed_lines.append(line)
    return processed_lines
</patched>
```

These modifications are hypothetical and aim to illustrate the type of changes that might resolve the issue of duplicated `*args` and `**kwargs` in Sphinx's autodoc generated documentation. The actual implementation would require access to the Sphinx source code, a thorough understanding of the autodoc extension's current handling of function signatures and docstrings, and testing to ensure the changes address the issue without introducing new problems.
