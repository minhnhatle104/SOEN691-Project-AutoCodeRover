Given the constraints and the feedback, let's adjust the format to focus on the addition of the new methods directly, without attempting to reiterate the entire class content. This approach directly addresses the issue by showing the insertion points for the new methods within the `MCodePrinter` class.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathematica.py</file>
<original># Placeholder for the addition of _print_Derivative method</original>
<patched>    def _print_Derivative(self, expr):
        """Prints the derivative in Mathematica form."""
        return "D[%s]" % (self.stringify(expr.args, ", "))</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathematica.py</file>
<original># Placeholder for the addition of _print_Float method</original>
<patched>    def _print_Float(self, expr):
        """Prints the float in Mathematica form, handling exponent notation."""
        res = str(expr)
        return res.replace('e', '*^')</patched>
```

These modifications indicate the addition of two new methods to the `MCodePrinter` class to handle derivatives and floats with exponents correctly, as per the issue description.
