Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be provided without access to the actual codebase or more detailed information about the implementation. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to what such a patch might entail based on common practices in addressing issues related to Django's ORM behavior, specifically regarding ordering with self-referencing foreign keys.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

The issue described involves unexpected ordering behavior when using self-referencing foreign keys in Django models. A patch would likely need to address the ORM's handling of ordering in relation to self-references and ensure that explicit `order_by` calls take precedence over any default model ordering.

#### Understanding the Issue

- Django's ORM allows for complex queries, including those that involve self-referencing foreign keys.
- The default ordering specified in a model's Meta class can sometimes conflict with or unexpectedly influence the ordering of related querysets.
- The issue seems to arise from the ORM not correctly isolating the explicit `order_by` directive in the presence of self-referencing foreign keys.

#### Hypothetical Patch

Since a direct code patch cannot be provided, below is a conceptual outline of what changes might be necessary:

1. **ORM Query Construction Logic**: Review and potentially revise the logic within Django's ORM that constructs SQL queries from queryset operations. This would involve ensuring that explicit `order_by` directives in a queryset are given precedence over default model ordering, especially when self-referencing foreign keys are involved.

    - **File**: Likely within `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` or similar.
    - **Conceptual Change**: Introduce logic to detect and prioritize `order_by` directives that reference self-referencing foreign keys, ensuring they override default model ordering.

2. **Model Meta Processing**: Ensure that the model's Meta ordering does not automatically apply to querysets that explicitly specify an `order_by` clause, particularly when dealing with self-references.

    - **File**: Potentially within `django/db/models/options.py` where model Meta options are processed.
    - **Conceptual Change**: Add a check to see if a queryset's `order_by` is explicitly set and, if so, bypass the application of the model's default Meta ordering for that query.

3. **QuerySet API Enhancement**: Enhance the queryset API to allow developers more control over when and how ordering is applied, especially in complex scenarios involving self-references.

    - **File**: Likely within `django/db/models/query.py`.
    - **Conceptual Change**: Introduce a method or parameter that explicitly ignores model default ordering for a given queryset operation.

### Testing and Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests that specifically test for correct ordering behavior in scenarios involving self-referencing foreign keys.
- **Documentation**: Update the Django documentation to clearly describe the behavior of ordering in relation to self-referencing foreign keys and any new mechanisms introduced to control it.

### Community Engagement

- **Discussion**: Engage with the Django community for feedback on the proposed changes, ensuring they align with Django's design principles and do not introduce regressions.
- **Contribution**: Follow Django's contribution guidelines to submit the patch, including thorough testing and documentation.

This conceptual approach outlines the steps and considerations involved in addressing the described issue within Django's ORM. Actual implementation would require a deep understanding of Django's internals and collaboration with the Django community.
