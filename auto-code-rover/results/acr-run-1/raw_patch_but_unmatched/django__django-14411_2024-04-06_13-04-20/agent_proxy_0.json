Specifically, we need to understand how the label is being associated with the widget and identify the part of the code responsible for rendering the widget. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget\")`: This will help us find the class definition of `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` to understand its structure and methods, which could give us clues on how it's rendered and how the label is associated with it.\n\n2. `search_code(\"ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget\")`: This will help us find instances where `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is used or referenced throughout the codebase, which could include templates or admin configuration where the issue with the label's `for` attribute might arise.\n\nThese API calls are aimed at understanding both the definition and usage of `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` within the project, which is essential for identifying the root cause of the issue and formulating a patch."
