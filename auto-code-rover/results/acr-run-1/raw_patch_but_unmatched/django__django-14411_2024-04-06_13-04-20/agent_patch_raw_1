Given the context and the issue at hand, the patch will focus on ensuring that when `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is rendered in the admin, the label associated with it does not include a `for` attribute, as it points to a non-labelable element. The modifications will be made in the `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` file, specifically within the `AdminReadonlyField` class's `__init__` method, and potentially the `__iter__` method of the `Fieldline` class if necessary.

However, based on the provided code snippets and the nature of the issue, it seems that the most direct approach to resolving the issue would be to ensure that when the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is used, any label generated for it does not include a `for` attribute. This might involve adjusting how the label is generated or rendered, which seems to be handled outside the provided snippets, likely in the template or the rendering logic tied to `AdminReadonlyField`.

Since the exact mechanism for rendering the label with the `for` attribute is not visible within the provided snippets, and given the limitations of not having access to the template rendering logic (`auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html` was not found), the patch will focus on a hypothetical solution that could be applied if the rendering logic were accessible or if additional context indicated a clear point of intervention.

```python
<file>django/contrib/admin/helpers.py</file>
<original>def __init__(self, form, field, is_first, model_admin=None):
    ...
    self.field = {
        'name': class_name,
        'label': label,
        'help_text': help_text,
        'field': field,
    }
    ...
</original>
<patched>def __init__(self, form, field, is_first, model_admin=None):
    ...
    # Check if the widget is ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget to adjust label handling
    if hasattr(form.fields.get(class_name), 'widget') and isinstance(form.fields.get(class_name).widget, ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget):
        label = None  # Do not generate a 'for' attribute for this widget's label
    else:
        if form._meta.labels and class_name in form._meta.labels:
            label = form._meta.labels[class_name]
        else:
            label = label_for_field(field, form._meta.model, model_admin, form=form)
    
    self.field = {
        'name': class_name,
        'label': label,
        'help_text': help_text,
        'field': field,
    }
    ...
</patched>
```

Note: This modification assumes the ability to check the type of widget associated with the field within the `AdminReadonlyField` initialization and adjust the label accordingly. The actual implementation might require importing `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` at the top of the file:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget
```

Given the constraints and the information provided, this patch is hypothetical and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue based on the understanding that the `for` attribute's handling might be closely tied to how labels are generated and associated with fields and widgets in the admin. Further investigation and testing would be necessary to implement a precise and effective solution.
