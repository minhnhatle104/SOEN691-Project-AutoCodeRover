Given the constraints and the specific details provided, it appears that a direct patch to the provided code snippets may not be feasible without altering the structure of the program in a way that was not originally intended or without access to the parts of the code that directly manage the rendering of the label's `for` attribute for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`.

However, the core issue is that the label for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` should not have a `for` attribute pointing to a non-labelable element. Since the direct approach to modify the template or the rendering logic is not viable with the provided information and given the limitations, a conceptual solution would involve ensuring that any rendering logic that handles the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` specifically checks for this widget type and omits the `for` attribute from the label.

Without the ability to directly modify the template or the exact rendering logic, and based on the provided snippets and the structure of the Django admin's handling of readonly fields, a precise patch cannot be formulated under these constraints.

For a real-world application of a fix, one would need to:

1. Inspect the template rendering logic for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` to ensure it does not include a `for` attribute in the label when rendered.
2. Modify the Django admin or form rendering logic to recognize when a widget is non-labelable and adjust the HTML output accordingly.

Given these considerations, the best course of action would be to review the Django project's documentation, source code, or community contributions for updates or patches that address this specific issue, or to contribute a fix that directly addresses the handling of labels for non-labelable widgets in the admin interface.
