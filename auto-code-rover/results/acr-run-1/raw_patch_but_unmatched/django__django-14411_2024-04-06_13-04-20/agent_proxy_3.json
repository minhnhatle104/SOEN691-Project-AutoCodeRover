Based on the instructions and the analysis conducted, there's no need for further context from the search API calls as we have identified the potential location of the bug and have a clear direction on where to look for the issue and how to proceed with a fix. Therefore, my response to the questions should have been:\n\n- do we need more context:\n\n- where are bug locations: \n  - The template file `auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html` is the primary location where the issue is expected to be found, specifically in how the label is implemented for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`.\n  \nThis concludes that we have sufficient information to proceed without additional search API calls."
