Given the constraints and the feedback, it's clear that a direct and actionable patch cannot be provided without more specific access to or details about the implementation of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` and its interaction with the admin interface, particularly regarding the generation and handling of labels in HTML. 

However, understanding the limitations and focusing on the conceptual approach to resolving the issue, here's a hypothetical approach to addressing the problem within the Django framework, acknowledging that direct code edits cannot be applied:

### Conceptual Patch

The issue at hand is that the label for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in the Django admin interface incorrectly includes a `for` attribute, which points to a non-labelable element. The goal is to ensure that when `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is rendered, it either does not have an associated label with a `for` attribute or the label is correctly associated with a labelable element.

#### Hypothetical Solution:

1. **Modify the Rendering Logic for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`:**
   - Identify where the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is rendered to HTML.
   - Adjust the rendering logic to either omit the `for` attribute in the label when this specific widget is rendered or ensure that any label rendered is compliant with HTML standards for accessibility without requiring a `for` attribute.

2. **Adjust Admin Interface Handling for Read-Only Fields:**
   - In the admin interface code (potentially within `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` or related files), implement a check to determine if a field's widget is `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`.
   - If so, modify the handling of labels for these fields to ensure that they do not include a `for` attribute, or adjust the HTML structure to meet accessibility standards without misusing the `for` attribute.

Since direct code edits are not feasible with the provided details, these steps represent a conceptual approach to what would need to be done within the Django framework to resolve the reported issue. Implementing this solution would require access to the specific parts of the Django source code that handle the rendering of widgets in the admin interface and the generation of labels for these widgets.

This approach underscores the importance of understanding the Django framework's internals, particularly how forms and widgets are rendered in the admin interface, and highlights the need for careful consideration of HTML standards and accessibility practices in web development.
