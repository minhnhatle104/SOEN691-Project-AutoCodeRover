There's no labelable element for the widget, so the label shouldn't have a 'for' attribute.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` class within the `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` file. This class uses a template named `auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html` for rendering, and it is marked as read-only. This is crucial information because it confirms that the widget is indeed intended to render text (or similar non-input content) and thus should not have a `for` attribute pointing to it, as this attribute is meant for labelable form elements like input, textarea, or select.\n\nThe search results also indicate that the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is referenced in several places within the codebase, including:\n\n- `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`: This file likely deals with how widgets are rendered or used within the Django admin. The issue might be related to how this file handles the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`.\n- `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`: Apart from the class definition, there are other references to `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in this file, which might be related to its instantiation or configuration.\n- `tests/auth_tests/test_forms.py` and `tests/auth_tests/test_views.py`: These files contain tests that reference `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`. While they might not directly contribute to the issue, they could provide insights into how the widget is expected to function and be used.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve examining how the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is integrated into forms, particularly within the Django admin (as indicated by the reference in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`). The issue description points to a problem with the widget's label having a `for` attribute that points to a non-labelable element. This suggests that the solution might involve either removing the `for` attribute from the label when this widget is used or modifying how the widget is rendered to include a labelable element (if appropriate).\n\nTo proceed, we should look into the specific implementation details in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` and the widget's template (`auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html`) to understand how the label is being associated with the widget and to identify where the incorrect `for` attribute is being set. This will help in formulating a precise patch to resolve the issue."
