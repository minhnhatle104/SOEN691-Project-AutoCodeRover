This modification adjusts the logic for determining when to include the `from django.db import models` import in the migration file. It checks the serialized operations and dependencies for any references to `models.`, ensuring that the `models` module is imported whenever such references are present. This approach aims to address the issue where the `models` import might be missing in cases where it's implicitly required by the content of the operations or dependencies.
