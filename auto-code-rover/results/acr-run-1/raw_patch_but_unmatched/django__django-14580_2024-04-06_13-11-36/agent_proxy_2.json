The logic that conditionally adds the `models` import based on whether custom fields or mixins are used needs to be reviewed and potentially enhanced to ensure that all necessary cases are covered.\n        - The interaction with the `serialize` method and how custom fields or mixins are serialized might also play a role in ensuring necessary imports are included. However, the primary focus should be on the `as_string` method's handling of imports."
