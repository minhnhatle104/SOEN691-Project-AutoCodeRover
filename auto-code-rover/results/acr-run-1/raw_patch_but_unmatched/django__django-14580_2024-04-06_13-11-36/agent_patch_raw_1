This modification ensures that the `models` import is included in the generated migration file not only when it's explicitly found in the imports set but also when any operation or dependency string contains a reference to `models.`. This approach aims to cover cases where the necessity of the `models` module might not be directly declared in the imports set but is implied through the usage in operations or dependencies.
