Given the context and the issue with `autodoc_type_aliases` not affecting variables and attributes as expected, a direct patch cannot be precisely formulated without a deeper understanding of the internal logic and intended behavior of Sphinx's autodoc extension. However, based on the information provided, I can suggest a hypothetical approach that might address the issue or guide towards a solution.

The issue seems to revolve around the application of type aliases to variables and attributes documentation, which might not be directly handled by the methods identified (`format_args`, `format_signature`, etc.). These methods primarily deal with functions, methods, and classes. If `autodoc_type_aliases` is not affecting variables and attributes, it could be due to the absence of logic to apply these aliases in the parts of the code that handle variable and attribute documentation.

A potential patch would involve ensuring that `autodoc_type_aliases` are considered when documenting variables and attributes. This might require modifying or extending the logic in methods that process variable and attribute documentation to include type alias resolution.

Since the specific location and mechanism for such a change are not identified in the provided context, I'll outline a hypothetical modification that represents the kind of change that might be needed.

# Hypothetical Modification

```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for where the logic to document a variable or attribute might reside.
# Since the exact method or location is not specified, we cannot provide a direct original code snippet.
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patched code to include type alias resolution for variables and attributes
def document_variable_or_attribute(self, obj, **kwargs):
    # Existing logic to document the variable or attribute
    ...
    # Hypothetical addition to resolve and apply type aliases
    if hasattr(self.config, 'autodoc_type_aliases') and isinstance(obj.type, str):
        obj.type = self.config.autodoc_type_aliases.get(obj.type, obj.type)
    ...
</patched>
```

This modification is purely illustrative and assumes there exists a method responsible for documenting variables or attributes where type information is processed. The key addition is the hypothetical logic to check for type aliases in `autodoc_type_aliases` and apply them to the type of the variable or attribute being documented.

To develop a real patch, one would need to identify the specific parts of the code responsible for generating documentation for variables and attributes, understand how type information is currently handled, and then integrate type alias resolution based on `autodoc_type_aliases`.

Given the complexity of Sphinx and its extensions, such a change would also require thorough testing to ensure it behaves as expected across various scenarios and does not introduce regressions.
