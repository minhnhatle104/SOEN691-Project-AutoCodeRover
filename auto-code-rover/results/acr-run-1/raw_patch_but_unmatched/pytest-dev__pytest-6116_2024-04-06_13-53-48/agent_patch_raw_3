Given the constraints and the nature of the task, it appears there's been a misunderstanding in the process of generating a precise patch for the issue without direct access to the specific implementation details of the `--collect-only` option within the pytest codebase. The provided examples were meant to illustrate the general approach to adding a shortcut for a command-line option in Python, specifically within the context of pytest's argument parsing framework.

Without direct access to the specific code snippet where the `--collect-only` option is defined and added to pytest's command-line interface, it's challenging to provide an exact patch. The modification provided was intended as a conceptual guide rather than a direct patch due to the lack of specific details about the implementation of the `--collect-only` option.

In a real-world scenario, the developer tasked with implementing this feature would:
1. Locate the exact file and code snippet where the `--collect-only` option is defined.
2. Use the `addoption` method of the `Parser` class to add or modify the option, including a new short option (e.g., `-c`), ensuring it does not conflict with existing options.
3. Update any relevant documentation and tests to reflect this new shortcut.

Given the format and process of this interaction, it's important to note that creating a direct and applicable patch requires access to the full codebase and the ability to search and modify it directly, which is beyond the capabilities provided in this scenario.

For educational purposes, the approach and thought process described should serve as a guideline for how one might go about adding a shortcut for a command-line option in a Python project that uses a similar argument parsing mechanism to pytest.
