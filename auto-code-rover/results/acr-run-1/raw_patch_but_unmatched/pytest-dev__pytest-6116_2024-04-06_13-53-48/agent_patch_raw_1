To implement a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` command in pytest, we would modify the `addoption` method usage in the file where `--collect-only` is defined. Assuming that `-c` is not already used for another purpose in pytest (this needs to be verified), we can use `-c` as the shortcut. If `-c` is already in use, another character should be chosen based on the available options and community feedback.

Since the specific location where `--collect-only` is added as an option is not provided, I will demonstrate how to modify the `addoption` call in a hypothetical scenario. This modification assumes that `--collect-only` is defined in a file where command-line options are registered using the `Parser` class.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py</file>
<original>
self._anonymous.addoption("--collect-only", ...)
</original>
<patched>
self._anonymous.addoption("--collect-only", "-c", ...)
</patched>
```

This patch adds a one-character shortcut `-c` for the `--collect-only` option. The ellipsis (`...`) represents other parameters passed to `addoption` which are not modified by this patch. 

Please note, before applying this patch, it's crucial to:
- Verify that `-c` or any chosen character is not already in use by another option.
- Update the documentation to reflect the new shortcut for `--collect-only`.
- Add tests to ensure the new shortcut works as expected and does not interfere with existing functionality.
