Given the constraints and the fact that the specific original code snippet where `--collect-only` is added as an option was not provided, creating a precise patch is challenging without direct access to the exact location and implementation details. However, I can provide a more generalized example of how the patch could look, based on standard practices for adding command-line options in Python projects that use the `argparse` library, which is what the `Parser` class in pytest seems to be wrapping or mimicking.

Please note, the actual implementation in pytest might differ, and the provided patch is a conceptual demonstration meant to guide the process. It's essential to locate the exact place where `--collect-only` is defined in the pytest codebase to apply a similar change.

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code where --collect-only is added without a short option
self._anonymous.addoption("--collect-only", help="Only collect tests, don't execute them.", ...)
</original>
<patched>
# Conceptual patched code adding a short option '-c'
# Note: '-c' is chosen as an example. Ensure '-c' is not used by another option in pytest.
self._anonymous.addoption("--collect-only", "-c", help="Only collect tests, don't execute them.", ...)
</patched>
```

This conceptual modification demonstrates how to add a short option (`-c`) for the `--collect-only` command-line argument. When implementing this change, it's crucial to:
1. Verify that the chosen short option is not already in use.
2. Review the pytest documentation and update it accordingly to include the new short option.
3. Implement and run tests to ensure the new short option works as expected without causing conflicts or issues with other options.

Since the exact location and implementation details of the `--collect-only` option in the pytest codebase are not provided, it's recommended to search the pytest codebase for the exact implementation of the `--collect-only` option. This would allow for a precise and accurate patch to be created and applied.
