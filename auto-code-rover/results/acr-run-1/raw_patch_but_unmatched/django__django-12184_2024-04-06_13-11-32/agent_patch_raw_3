Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, it appears there's a fundamental misunderstanding or limitation in applying hypothetical patches directly to your project's codebase. Without access to the specific codebase and the exact code snippets causing the issue, providing a patch that directly corresponds to your program's current implementation is challenging. 

In real-world scenarios, addressing the issue described would involve a detailed review of both the URL configuration and the view function in question, ensuring compatibility with Django's handling of URL parameters, especially when upgrading between major versions.

However, based on the common patterns in Django and the nature of the issue described, the general advice would include ensuring that optional parameters in URL patterns are correctly defined and that view functions are prepared to handle cases where those parameters might not be provided.

If you're facing this issue in a real project, I recommend closely reviewing Django's documentation on URL dispatcher and view functions, paying special attention to any changes in behavior between the versions you're upgrading from and to. Additionally, consulting with the Django community through forums or other channels can provide valuable insights and specific advice tailored to your situation.

For now, without the ability to directly interact with your codebase or receive real-time feedback on the applicability of proposed changes, the best course of action is to approach the problem with a focus on understanding the underlying concepts and applying best practices as described in Django's official documentation and community resources.
