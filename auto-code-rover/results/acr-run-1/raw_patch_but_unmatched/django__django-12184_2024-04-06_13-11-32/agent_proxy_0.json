            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `modules` view function is defined and used within the Django project. Specifically, we're looking for how it handles URL parameters and how it's called, which seems to be causing a mismatch in the expected number of arguments. Given the information in the issue, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. **search_method(\"modules\")**: This will help us find all occurrences of the `modules` method in the codebase to understand its definition and any modifications or overloads that might exist.\n\n2. **search_code(\"urlpatterns += [\")**: Since the issue mentions a specific pattern in the URLConf, searching for this code snippet will help us identify where and how URL patterns are defined in the project. This can give us more context on how the `modules` view function is expected to be routed and any potential discrepancies in URL pattern definitions.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how the `modules` function is integrated within the project and any potential issues with its invocation or URL pattern definitions."
