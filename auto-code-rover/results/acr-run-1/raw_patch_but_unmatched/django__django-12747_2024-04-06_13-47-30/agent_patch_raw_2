Given the constraints and the information provided, creating a precise patch without direct access to the specific implementation details of the `QuerySet.delete` method and the deletion process in the Django ORM is challenging. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to address the inconsistency described in the issue, which can be adapted to the specific codebase.

The issue describes an inconsistency in the result format of the `QuerySet.delete` method, particularly in how the dictionary part of the result tuple is constructed depending on whether models have foreign keys or not. A consistent approach would either always include model labels with a count of zero in the dictionary or omit models with zero deletions entirely.

Since I cannot provide an exact match for the original program, the following is a conceptual patch that aims to standardize the result format:

### Conceptual Patch

The goal is to modify the `QuerySet.delete` method to ensure that the dictionary part of the result tuple consistently includes all models involved in the deletion process, even if the count of deleted instances is zero. This approach assumes the deletion process involves collecting models and instances to be deleted and then iterating over this collection to perform deletions.

#### Conceptual modification
```python
<file>path/to/django/db/models/query.py or deletion.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet where deletion results are aggregated.
return sum(deleted_counts), {model._meta.label: count for model, count in deleted_items}
</original>
<patched>
# Conceptual patched code to ensure consistency in result format.
total_deleted = sum(deleted_counts)
# Initialize the result dictionary with all involved models set to zero deletions.
result_dict = {model._meta.label: 0 for model in involved_models}
# Update the dictionary with actual deletion counts.
result_dict.update({model._meta.label: count for model, count in deleted_items if count > 0})
return total_deleted, result_dict
</patched>
```

This conceptual modification ensures that the result dictionary includes entries for all models involved in the deletion process, initialized to zero. It then updates this dictionary with actual deletion counts for models where deletions occurred. This approach standardizes the result format, addressing the inconsistency described in the issue.

Please adapt this conceptual approach to the specific implementation details of your project, taking care to test the changes thoroughly in a development environment before applying them to production.
