Given the information provided in the issue, the following API calls would be most relevant:\n\n1. **Search for the `Delete` method in the `QuerySet` class**: This will help us understand the current implementation of the `Delete` method, which is central to the issue.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"Delete\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n2. **Search for code snippets related to the result format of the `Delete` method**: Since the issue describes an inconsistency in the result format, searching for how the result tuple is constructed might reveal where the inconsistency originates.\n   \n   `search_code(\"result format of the QuerySet.Delete method\")`\n\n3. **Search for model definitions to understand the difference between models with and without foreign keys**: This could help us understand if the issue arises due to how these models are handled differently in the deletion process.\n   \n   `search_code(\"models with foreign keys\")`\n   `search_code(\"simple models without foreign key\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the deletion process is implemented and why it might behave differently for models based on their relationships."
