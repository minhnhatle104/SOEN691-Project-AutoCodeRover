Given the nature of the issue described and without direct access to the specific codebase or additional context from search results, I will provide a hypothetical patch based on common Django ORM patterns. This patch aims to address the inconsistency in the result format of the `QuerySet.delete` method between models with and without foreign keys. Please note, the actual file paths and code snippets might differ in your project.

### Hypothetical Patch

The goal is to ensure that the `QuerySet.delete` method returns a consistent result format, specifically the dictionary part of the tuple, regardless of whether models have foreign keys or not.

#### modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>
collector = Collector(using=using)
collector.collect([self])
collector.delete()

return sum([len(batch) for batch in collector.data.values()]), {}
</original>
<patched>
collector = Collector(using=using)
collector.collect([self])
deleted, _ = collector.delete()

# Ensure a consistent dictionary format for the second element of the tuple
deleted_counter = {model._meta.label: count for model, count in collector.data.items()}
return deleted, deleted_counter if deleted_counter else {}
</patched>
```

#### modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/deletion.py</file>
<original>
def delete(self):
    # Note: This is a simplified version of the method for illustration.
    # Actual implementation may vary.
    deleted_counter = {}
    for model, instances in self.data.items():
        count = len(instances)  # Count might be 0 for models without instances to delete
        deleted_counter[model._meta.label] = count
        for obj in instances:
            obj.delete()
    return deleted_counter
</original>
<patched>
def delete(self):
    # Note: This is a simplified version of the method for illustration.
    # Actual implementation may vary.
    deleted_counter = {}
    for model, instances in self.data.items():
        count = len(instances)  # Count might be 0 for models without instances to delete
        if count > 0:  # Only add to deleted_counter if count > 0 to maintain consistency
            deleted_counter[model._meta.label] = count
        for obj in instances:
            obj.delete()
    # Ensure the dictionary includes all models processed, even if count is 0
    for model in self.models:
        if model._meta.label not in deleted_counter:
            deleted_counter[model._meta.label] = 0
    return deleted_counter
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are based on a generic understanding of Django's deletion process and the described issue. The actual implementation in your project may require adjustments. Always test patches in a development environment before applying them to your production codebase.
