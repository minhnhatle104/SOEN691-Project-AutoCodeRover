I understand the challenge and acknowledge the limitations in providing a precise patch without direct access to the specific codebase and its implementation details. Given the scenario and the information provided, it's clear that creating an exact patch matching the original program is not feasible in this context.

Addressing the issue described requires a detailed review of the project's codebase, specifically the implementation of the `QuerySet.delete` method and possibly related deletion handling mechanisms within Django's ORM. The goal would be to ensure consistent behavior in the result format when deleting objects, regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not.

Since a precise patch cannot be provided without matching the original program, I recommend the following steps for developers facing this issue:

1. **Review the `QuerySet.delete` Implementation**: Start by closely examining the implementation of the `delete` method within the `QuerySet` class. Look for how the result tuple is constructed, especially how the dictionary of deleted objects by model is generated.

2. **Identify Inconsistency in Result Construction**: Identify the conditional logic or handling differences that lead to the inconsistency in the result format between models with and without foreign keys. This might involve how related objects are collected and deleted, and how their counts are aggregated in the result.

3. **Implement Consistent Result Formatting**: Modify the logic to ensure that the dictionary part of the result tuple consistently includes entries for all models involved in the deletion process, with counts set to zero where applicable. This might involve initializing the dictionary with all target models set to a deletion count of zero and then updating these counts based on actual deletions.

4. **Test Thoroughly**: Before applying any changes to the production codebase, thoroughly test the modified behavior to ensure that it addresses the issue without introducing new problems. Consider edge cases, such as deletions involving complex model relationships and cascading deletes.

Without the ability to provide a direct patch, these steps offer a guideline for addressing the issue within the specific context of the project's codebase. Developers should adapt these recommendations based on their detailed understanding of the project's implementation and test any changes in a controlled environment.
