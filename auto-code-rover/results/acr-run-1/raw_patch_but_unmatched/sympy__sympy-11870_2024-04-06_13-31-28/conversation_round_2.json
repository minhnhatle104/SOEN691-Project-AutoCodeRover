        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified three relevant pieces of information regarding the `trigsimp` function within the codebase:\n\n1. **Primary `trigsimp` Functionality (sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py):** This is the core implementation of the `trigsimp` function. It describes the function's purpose as reducing expressions by using known trigonometric identities. The function supports multiple methods for simplification, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. Each method has a different approach to simplification, with 'fu' being based on a collection of trigonometric transformations. The function attempts to simplify the expression recursively and can handle various trigonometric functions and patterns.\n\n2. **Vector BasisDependent Class (sympy/vector/basisdependent.py):** Here, `trigsimp` is implemented as a method within the `BasisDependent` class. This implementation seems to apply the `trigsimp` routine specifically to components of a vector, indicating that the `trigsimp` functionality is also integrated into the vector algebra part of the library.\n\n3. **Expression Class (sympy/core/expr.py):** In the `Expr` class, `trigsimp` is provided as a method that essentially wraps the primary `trigsimp` function from `sympy.simplify`. This allows any expression object to directly call `trigsimp` on itself, simplifying its usage across different parts of the library.\n\nGiven the issue description, the primary concern is with the core implementation of `trigsimp` in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`. The user expects the function to simplify expressions involving exponential forms into trigonometric forms, specifically expecting `sin(k)` and `sinc(k)` as outputs for the given inputs. The issue suggests that the current implementation might not handle these specific cases as expected.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to consider enhancing the `trigsimp` function to recognize and simplify the patterns involving exponential forms into their trigonometric counterparts more effectively. This might involve adjusting or extending the logic within the 'matching', 'fu', or possibly introducing a new method specifically designed to handle such cases. Additionally, ensuring that the function can simplify expressions to `sinc(k)` would require incorporating knowledge about the `sinc` function and its relationship with trigonometric and exponential forms.\n\nNext steps would involve diving deeper into the implementation details of the `trigsimp` function, particularly focusing on how it handles exponential expressions and identifying where enhancements can be made to support the desired simplifications."
