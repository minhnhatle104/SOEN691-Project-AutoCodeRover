Since the original request was to add new functionality (the `__len__` method) to the `Pipeline` class rather than modifying existing code, the format for presenting the patch needs to be adjusted. Given that there's no original code snippet to replace (as we're adding a new method), the patch description should focus on the addition itself.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/pipeline.py</file>
<original>
</original>
<patched>    def __len__(self):
        """Returns the total number of steps in the pipeline."""
        return len(self.steps)
</patched>
```

This patch introduces the `__len__` method to the `Pipeline` class within the `sklearn/pipeline.py` file. The method calculates and returns the number of steps in the pipeline, which is determined by the length of the `self.steps` list. This addition enables the use of the `len()` function on `Pipeline` instances, thereby resolving the issue where such usage previously raised an error due to the absence of the `__len__` method.
