Given the instructions and the nature of the task, it seems there was a misunderstanding in how the patch should be presented, especially considering the context of adding new functionality rather than modifying existing code. Since the task involves adding a new method (`__len__`) to the `Pipeline` class in `sklearn/pipeline.py` and there's no specific "original" code block to replace, the format for the patch doesn't directly apply as there's no original code to show being replaced or modified. 

However, in a real-world scenario, the patch would be submitted through a version control system (like Git) as a commit that adds the new method to the class. The description of the modification would highlight the addition of the `__len__` method to the `Pipeline` class, enabling support for the `len()` function on pipeline objects. 

For the sake of clarity and following the instructions as closely as possible, here's an attempt to reformat the patch description to fit the expected structure, even though there's no "original" code snippet to modify:

```python
# Since the task is to add a new method, there's no direct "original" code snippet to replace.
# The patch below represents the addition of the __len__ method to the Pipeline class.

# modification 1
<file>sklearn/pipeline.py</file>
<original>
# No original code snippet to replace, as we are adding a new method.
</original>
<patched>
    def __len__(self):
        """Returns the total number of steps in the pipeline."""
        return len(self.steps)
</patched>
```

This description assumes the addition of the `__len__` method at an appropriate place within the `Pipeline` class definition in the `sklearn/pipeline.py` file. The method itself is straightforward, simply returning the length of the `self.steps` list, which accurately represents the number of steps in the pipeline.
