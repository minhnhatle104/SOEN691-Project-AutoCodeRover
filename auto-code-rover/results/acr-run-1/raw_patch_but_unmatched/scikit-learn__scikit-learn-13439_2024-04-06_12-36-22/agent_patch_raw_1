        return len(self.steps)
</patched>
```

This patch adds the `__len__` method to the `Pipeline` class, enabling users to use the `len()` function on instances of `Pipeline`. This method simply returns the length of the `steps` list, which represents the total number of steps in the pipeline. This change resolves the issue where attempting to use `len(pipe)` would raise an error due to the absence of the `__len__` method.
