Given the nature of the issue with the Django development server not restarting after modifying the `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` setting by adding `BASE_DIR`, and without specific details on the code causing this behavior, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common Django configurations and practices. This patch aims to ensure that changes to settings, particularly to `TEMPLATES`, do not interfere with the autoreload mechanism of the Django development server.

Please note, the actual implementation details might vary based on your Django project's version and setup. This is a conceptual guide intended to illustrate how one might approach resolving the described issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/runserver.py</file>
<original>
def inner_run(self, *args, **options):
    autoreload.run_with_reloader(self.inner_runserver, *args, **options)
</original>
<patched>
from django.utils import autoreload
from django.conf import settings

def inner_run(self, *args, **options):
    def restart_server(*args, **options):
        self.inner_runserver(*args, **options)
        settings.INITIALIZED = False
    autoreload.run_with_reloader(restart_server, *args, **options)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/utils/autoreload.py</file>
<original>
def reloader_thread():
    while RUN_RELOADER:
        if ensure_echo_on():
            if code_changed():
                sys.exit(3)
</original>
<patched>
def reloader_thread():
    from django.conf import settings
    while RUN_RELOADER:
        if ensure_echo_on():
            if code_changed() or not getattr(settings, 'INITIALIZED', True):
                settings.INITIALIZED = True
                sys.exit(3)
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>django/template/utils.py</file>
<original>
class Engine(object):
    def __init__(self, dirs=None, app_dirs=False, ...):
        self.dirs = dirs or []
        ...
</original>
<patched>
from django.conf import settings

class Engine(object):
    def __init__(self, dirs=None, app_dirs=False, ...):
        if not getattr(settings, 'INITIALIZED', True):
            dirs = settings.TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']
        self.dirs = dirs or []
        ...
</patched>
```

**Explanation:**
- **Modification 1** and **2** aim to introduce a flag within the settings to track the initialization state of the application. This flag is checked by the autoreload mechanism to determine if a restart is necessary due to changes in the settings, particularly in `TEMPLATES`.
- **Modification 3** ensures that any changes to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` are recognized and applied by the template engine upon server restart.

Keep in mind, this is a hypothetical solution and might require adjustments to fit the actual codebase and Django version you are working with. Always test patches in a development environment before applying them to production.
