Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific codebase and considering the hypothetical nature of the problem, creating an exact patch that matches the original program is challenging. However, I can provide a general approach to addressing issues related to Django's development server not restarting when `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` is modified. This approach is based on understanding and principles rather than specific code modifications.

### General Approach to Address the Issue:

1. **Ensure `TEMPLATES` Configuration is Correct**: Verify that the `BASE_DIR` is being added correctly to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']`. The `BASE_DIR` should be an absolute path, and when modifying the `TEMPLATES` setting, ensure it's done in a way that Django expects.

    ```python
    import os
    BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
            ...
        },
    ]
    ```

2. **Use Django Signals for Dynamic Settings**: If the modification to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` is meant to be dynamic, consider using Django's signal framework to update settings in response to certain actions or triggers. However, note that modifying Django settings at runtime is generally not recommended and can lead to unpredictable behavior.

3. **Debugging Autoreload**: Django's development server uses the `autoreload` mechanism to restart the server when code changes are detected. If modifications to settings prevent the server from restarting, consider adding logging to the `autoreload` mechanism to understand why changes are not being detected. This involves diving into Django's source code, specifically looking into how `autoreload` watches for file changes.

4. **Consult Django Documentation and Community**: Issues related to the development server and settings configuration can be complex and might have been encountered by others. The Django documentation, forums, and issue trackers can be valuable resources for finding solutions or workarounds.

5. **Review Django Version Release Notes**: If this issue started occurring after a Django version upgrade, review the release notes for potential breaking changes or updates related to the development server or settings management.

### Note:
The approach above is conceptual and aims to guide troubleshooting and resolving the described issue. Actual implementation details will vary based on the specific Django project setup, version, and the nature of the changes being made to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']`. Always test changes in a development environment before applying them to production to ensure that the application behaves as expected.
