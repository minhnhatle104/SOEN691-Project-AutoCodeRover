Unfortunately, this cannot be used in combination with the unix `MANPATH` environment variable. The `man` program explicitly looks for man pages in section directories (such as `man/man1`, etc.).\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt would be great if sphinx would automatically create the section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.) and place each generated man page within appropriate section.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThis problem can be over come within our project\u2019s build system, ensuring the built man pages are installed in a correct location, but it would be nice if the build directory had the proper layout.\nI\u2019m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a `man/` directory.\n</issue>"
