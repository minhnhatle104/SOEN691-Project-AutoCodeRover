Given the nature of the issue described and without direct access to specific files or code snippets from the project's codebase that demonstrate the problem, I will provide a hypothetical patch based on common Django practices and the issue description. This patch assumes the issue lies in how Django's model inheritance handles choices and the `get_<field_name>_display()` method's interaction with these choices.

Since we're dealing with a problem where `get_<field_name>_display()` does not return the expected display value for choices defined in a child model, a potential workaround is to override the `get_<field_name>_display()` method in the child model to ensure it correctly handles the choices defined in the child model.

Please note, this is a conceptual solution and might need adjustments to fit into the actual project's codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>models.py</file>
<original>
class B(A):
    foo_choice = [("A", "output1"), ("B", "output2"), ("C", "output3")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choice)
</original>
<patched>
class B(A):
    foo_choice = [("A", "output1"), ("B", "output2"), ("C", "output3")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choice)

    def get_field_foo_display(self):
        for choice in self.foo_choice:
            if choice[0] == self.field_foo:
                return choice[1]
        return super().get_field_foo_display()
</patched>
```

This patch overrides the `get_field_foo_display()` method in the child model `B`. It first checks if the `field_foo` value matches any of the choices defined in `B`. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding display value. If no match is found (which might be the case for values defined in the parent model's choices or default behavior), it falls back to the superclass's implementation of `get_field_foo_display()`, preserving the expected functionality for choices defined in the parent model.

Remember, this is a simplified example. Depending on the complexity of the models and inheritance structure in your project, you might need to adjust this approach. Additionally, this solution assumes that the issue is with the method's inability to correctly handle overridden choices in the child model, which is based on the issue description provided.
