Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details in the project's codebase, providing a precise patch is challenging. However, I'll offer a generic approach to address the issue based on common Django model inheritance patterns and the functionality of the `get_<field_name>_display()` method. This approach is conceptual and may require adaptation to fit the specific details of your project.

Since the direct application of a patch is not feasible without matching the original program, let's focus on a conceptual solution that addresses the core issue: ensuring `get_<field_name>_display()` works correctly with inherited choices.

### Conceptual Patch

The issue stems from `get_<field_name>_display()` not correctly handling choices added in a child model. A potential solution involves explicitly handling the choices at the child model level to ensure the display function considers the extended set of choices.

#### Assumptions
- The base model `A` defines a set of choices and a field `field_foo`.
- The child model `B` extends the choices for `field_foo`.
- Django's default `get_<field_name>_display()` does not handle the extended choices in `B` as expected.

#### Conceptual Solution
Override the `get_<field_name>_display()` method in the child model to manually handle the extended choices.

```python
# Assuming the models are defined in models.py
<file>models.py</file>
<original>
class B(A):
    foo_choice = [("A", "output1"), ("B", "output2"), ("C", "output3")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choice)
</original>
<patched>
class B(A):
    foo_choice = [("A", "output1"), ("B", "output2"), ("C", "output3")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choice)

    def get_field_foo_display(self):
        # Manually handle the choices defined in B
        choice_dict = dict(self.foo_choice)
        if self.field_foo in choice_dict:
            return choice_dict[self.field_foo]
        else:
            # Fallback to the parent method if the choice is not overridden
            return super(B, self).get_field_foo_display()
</patched>
```

### Explanation
This conceptual patch overrides the `get_field_foo_display()` method in the child model `B`. It first attempts to find the display value for `field_foo` within the choices defined in `B`. If the value is found, it returns the corresponding display string. If not, it falls back to the superclass's implementation, which should handle any choices defined in the base model `A` or default behavior.

Please note, this solution is based on a generic understanding of the issue as described and assumes the models are defined in a file named `models.py`. The actual implementation may require adjustments based on the specific details of your project's codebase, including the correct file paths and class definitions.
