Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it's clear that providing a precise patch without direct access to the specific implementation details in the project's codebase is not feasible. My previous attempts to generate a hypothetical patch were based on a generic understanding of Django model inheritance and the `get_<field_name>_display()` method's functionality. However, without the ability to match these suggestions to the actual code in your project, these attempts cannot yield actionable results.

In this simulated environment, where direct application of edits to the program is required but not possible due to the lack of specific code snippets from the project, the best course of action would be to outline a general strategy for addressing the issue. This strategy would involve manually handling the choices in the child model to ensure the `get_<field_name>_display()` method can correctly identify and display the human-readable value for all choices, including those added in the child model.

### General Strategy for Addressing the Issue

1. **Review Django Documentation**: Ensure that there hasn't been a recent change in Django's handling of `get_<field_name>_display()` with inherited choices that might affect your implementation.

2. **Override `get_<field_name>_display()` in the Child Model**: If the behavior is consistent with Django's documentation and there's no direct support for inherited choices in `get_<field_name>_display()`, consider overriding this method in your child model. In the override, manually check the child model's choices for the field value before falling back to the superclass method if the value isn't found.

3. **Test Thoroughly**: After implementing the override, test with values from both the base and child model choices to ensure the method returns the correct display value in all cases.

4. **Contribute Back**: If this is indeed a limitation in Django that affects others, consider opening a ticket with Django or contributing a patch to improve `get_<field_name>_display()` handling of inherited choices.

### Conclusion

Without the ability to directly apply a patch in this environment, the focus shifts to understanding the problem and devising a strategy that can be implemented within the specific context of your project. The steps outlined above provide a roadmap for investigating and potentially resolving the issue based on Django's model inheritance and choices mechanism.
