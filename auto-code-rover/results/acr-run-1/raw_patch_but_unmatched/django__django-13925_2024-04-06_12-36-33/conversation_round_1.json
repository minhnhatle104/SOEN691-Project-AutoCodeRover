Specifically, we need to look into the base class `Entity` from which the `User` class inherits, as the issue mentions that primary keys are manually defined in the ancestor model but Django 3.2 alpha seems to ignore this configuration.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be necessary to gather more context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Entity` class**: This will help us understand how the primary key is defined in the base class.\n   - `search_class(\"Entity\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `User` class**: Since the issue specifically mentions the `User` class as an example, examining its definition will provide insights into how it inherits from `Entity`.\n   - `search_class(\"User\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting**: This setting's configuration might give us clues about the project's global settings regarding auto-created primary keys.\n   - `search_code(\"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."

        "content": "Based on the search results, let's analyze the context we've gathered to understand the issue better and formulate a potential solution.\n\n1. **Entity Class**: The search for the `Entity` class yielded two results, both in test directories (`tests/select_for_update/models.py` and `tests/order_with_respect_to/models.py`). However, the provided code snippets do not show how the primary key is defined within these classes. Given that these are test directories, it's also possible that the relevant `Entity` class might not be among these results or the issue pertains to a custom implementation not captured in the search results.\n\n2. **User Class**: The search for the `User` class returned 11 matches across various files, including `django/contrib/auth/models.py` and several test directories. This indicates that the `User` class is widely used and potentially customized in different parts of the codebase. Without specific file paths or project structure, it's challenging to identify which `User` class is relevant to the issue. The mention of `accounts.User` in the issue suggests that the relevant `User` class might be part of a custom app or module named `accounts`, which wasn't directly identified in the search results.\n\n3. **DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD Setting**: The search for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` found 27 snippets across various files, including `django/conf/global_settings.py`, `django/db/models/options.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and more. This setting is crucial for understanding how Django 3.2 alpha handles auto-created primary keys by default. The presence of this setting in global settings and model options suggests it's a configurable option that affects how primary keys are generated for models without an explicitly defined primary key.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\n- The issue seems to stem from a change in how Django 3.2 alpha handles auto-created primary keys, possibly related to the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting.\n- The specific implementation of primary keys in the `Entity` class and its inheritance by the `User` class couldn't be directly assessed from the search results.\n- The global `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting likely plays a key role in this issue, suggesting that configuring it appropriately in the project's settings or within specific apps could resolve the warnings.\n\n**Next Steps**:\nTo address the issue, it would be advisable to:\n- Review the project's settings to ensure `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is configured to use a subclass of `AutoField` that matches the project's requirements (e.g., `BigAutoField` if larger primary key values are needed).\n- Examine the implementation of the `Entity` class and how it defines the primary key to ensure it's compatible with Django 3.2's expectations for inherited primary keys.\n- Verify that the inheritance of the primary key in subclasses like `User` is correctly implemented, ensuring that Django recognizes the inherited primary key without attempting to auto-create a new one.\n\nWithout direct access to the codebase or more specific search results, these recommendations are based on the information available and general Django best practices."
