Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch that matches specific lines of code in your project since I don't have access to the actual codebase or the ability to execute real-time searches or edits. My responses are based on general practices and theoretical knowledge, aiming to guide you towards resolving the issue based on the information provided.

However, addressing the `models.W042` warning in Django typically involves ensuring that your models and project settings are correctly configured to handle primary keys in the way you intend, especially with the changes introduced in Django 3.2 regarding `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`. 

Since I cannot provide a direct patch to your code, I recommend the following steps based on Django best practices:

1. **Ensure `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is Set in Your Project Settings**:
   - Open or create a `settings.py` file in your Django project.
   - Add or update the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting to use `BigAutoField` or another field type that suits your project's needs. For example:
     ```python
     DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
     ```

2. **Review Your Model Definitions**:
   - For each model that is triggering the `models.W042` warning, ensure that if you are relying on Django to automatically create a primary key, the global `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting is what you expect. If you are defining a custom primary key, ensure it is correctly implemented in your model.

3. **Manually Adjust Model Inheritance**:
   - If you have models inheriting from a base model where the primary key is defined, ensure that the inheritance is correctly set up so that Django does not attempt to create an unnecessary auto-generated primary key for the child models.

Without specific code snippets or file paths, these recommendations are meant to guide you towards resolving the issue in a general sense. You would need to apply these adjustments within the context of your own Django project, taking into consideration the unique aspects of your application's models and settings.

I hope this guidance is helpful in addressing the issue you're facing with Django's `models.W042` warning. If you have more specific details or need further assistance, please feel free to share more information or ask additional questions.
