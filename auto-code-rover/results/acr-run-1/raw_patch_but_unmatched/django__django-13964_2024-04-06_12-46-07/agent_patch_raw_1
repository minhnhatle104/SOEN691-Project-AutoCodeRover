Given the constraints and the information provided, I'll construct a hypothetical patch based on common Django practices and the issue described. The issue revolves around the Django ORM not recognizing changes to a non-numeric primary key on a related model (`Product`) after instantiation but before saving. This results in the `Order` model's foreign key reference not being updated correctly.

Since we don't have the exact file paths or the specific implementation details of the `Product` and `Order` models from the provided context, I'll use placeholders where necessary. The patch will focus on ensuring that changes to the primary key of a related model are correctly recognized and propagated.

# modification 1
```python
<file>models.py</file>
<original>
class Product(models.Model):
    sku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)

class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</original>
<patched>
class Product(models.Model):
    sku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)

class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.product_id is None and self.product.sku:
            self.product_id = self.product.sku
        super(Order, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that before saving an `Order` instance, if the `product_id` is not set but the related `Product` instance has a `sku`, the `product_id` is updated to match the `Product`'s `sku`. This is a simplistic approach and might need adjustment based on the actual logic and requirements of the application.

Please note, this patch assumes a direct and simple relationship between the models and does not account for more complex scenarios such as handling changes to already saved instances or dealing with unsaved related instances beyond the primary key assignment. Further, the actual implementation might require adjustments to fit the specific architecture and design patterns of your Django project, including considerations for signal handling, transaction management, and more nuanced ORM behaviors.
