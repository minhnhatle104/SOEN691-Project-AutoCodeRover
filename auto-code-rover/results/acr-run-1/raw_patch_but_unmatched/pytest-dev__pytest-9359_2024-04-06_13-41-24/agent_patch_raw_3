Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details or the ability to execute real-time modifications, I'll provide a conceptual approach to addressing the issue. This approach will focus on general best practices for debugging and potentially resolving the type of error reporting discrepancy observed between Python versions when using pytest.

### Conceptual Patch for Error Reporting Issue in pytest with Python 3.9

The issue at hand involves pytest error reporting in Python 3.9, where an extra line of code is printed in the error details, which does not occur in Python 3.7. This suggests a difference in how pytest or Python itself is handling error reporting or traceback generation between these versions.

#### General Approach to Resolution:

1. **Ensure Compatibility with Python 3.9 in Decorators**:
   If decorators are affecting the way pytest reports errors, ensuring they are transparent to the introspection mechanisms used by pytest could help. This involves using `functools.wraps` in decorator definitions to preserve the metadata of the decorated functions.

   ```python
   from functools import wraps

   def decorator(func):
       @wraps(func)
       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
           # Decorator logic here
           return func(*args, **kwargs)
       return wrapper
   ```

2. **Review pytest and Python Release Notes**:
   Review the release notes for pytest and Python 3.9 to identify any changes related to error reporting, traceback handling, or decorator support that could explain the observed behavior.

3. **Adjust pytest Configuration**:
   Explore pytest configuration options that might influence error reporting verbosity or format. Adjusting these settings could provide a workaround for the issue.

4. **Engage with the Community**:
   If the issue persists, engaging with the pytest and Python communities by reporting the issue, along with a minimal reproducible example, could yield insights or solutions from developers who have encountered similar issues.

5. **Patch or Workaround**:
   Based on insights gained from the above steps, implement a patch or workaround. This might involve adjusting the way tests are written, modifying decorators, or contributing a fix to pytest if the issue is identified as a bug in pytest itself.

### Note:

This approach is conceptual and based on general best practices for debugging and resolving compatibility issues between different Python versions. The actual resolution might require specific adjustments based on the detailed behavior of pytest and the Python runtime environment.
