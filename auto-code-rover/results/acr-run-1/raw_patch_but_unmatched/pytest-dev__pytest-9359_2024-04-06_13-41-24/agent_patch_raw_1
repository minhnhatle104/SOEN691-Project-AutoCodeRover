Given the nature of the issue described, which involves an error message printing extra code lines when using `assert` in Python 3.9 with pytest, and without specific details on the implementation of the `@t` decorator or direct access to the project's codebase, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices and potential causes for such issues. This patch will be speculative and aims to illustrate how one might approach resolving a discrepancy in error reporting between different Python versions.

### Hypothetical Patch for Decorator-Related Error Reporting Issue

The issue seems to involve pytest's error reporting mechanism, potentially in conjunction with how decorators are implemented or used within the test suite. A common cause for additional lines appearing in error output could be related to how pytest introspects the test function's code to generate the error message. Python 3.9 introduced several changes and optimizations, which might affect this introspection process.

Without specific details on the `@t` decorator or the exact mechanism by which pytest's error reporting has changed, a general approach to mitigate such issues could involve ensuring that decorators used in the test suite do not interfere with pytest's ability to accurately introspect test functions.

#### Modification 1: Ensuring Decorator Transparency for Test Functions

```python
<file>testing/utils.py</file>
<original>
def t(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Decorator logic here
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
</patched>
<patched>
from functools import wraps

def t(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Decorator logic here
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
</patched>
```

This modification uses `functools.wraps` to ensure that the decorated function retains its original name, docstring, and other attributes. This can help tools like pytest that use introspection to more accurately report errors, as the decorator does not obscure the original function's metadata.

#### Note:

Since the actual implementation of the `@t` decorator and the specific interactions causing the reported issue are not provided, the above patch is speculative and serves as an example of how one might address issues related to decorators and error reporting in test suites. If the `@t` decorator or similar patterns are not directly related to the issue, or if the problem lies deeper within the integration between Python 3.9 and pytest, further investigation and a different approach would be necessary.
