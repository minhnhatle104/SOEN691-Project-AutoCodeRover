Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, let's create a hypothetical patch that aims to address the problem of extra lines being printed in error messages when using `assert` in Python 3.9 with pytest. This patch will be speculative and based on common practices for ensuring compatibility and correct behavior across Python versions in testing environments.

### Hypothetical Patch for Improved Error Reporting in pytest with Python 3.9

**Background**: The issue involves pytest error reporting in Python 3.9, where an extra line of code is printed in the error details. This behavior is not observed in Python 3.7. The problem might be related to changes in Python 3.9 that affect how pytest processes and displays errors, particularly in the context of decorated functions.

#### Modification 1: Update to pytest's Error Reporting Mechanism

```python
<file>src/_pytest/_code/code.py</file>
<original>
def _getcrashentry(self):
    # Original code that determines how pytest formats error messages
</original>
<patched>
def _getcrashentry(self):
    # Updated code with a conditional check for Python 3.9
    # to adjust how error messages are formatted and which lines are included
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Decorator Handling in pytest under Python 3.9

```python
<file>src/_pytest/python.py</file>
<original>
# Code related to handling of test functions, including those that are decorated
</original>
<patched>
# Adjusted handling of decorated test functions to ensure compatibility with Python 3.9,
# including changes to introspection or error reporting mechanisms that may behave differently in this version
</patched>
```

### Note:

These modifications are speculative and aim to illustrate potential areas within pytest that could be adjusted to resolve the issue described. The actual implementation would require:

1. A detailed understanding of the changes introduced in Python 3.9 that could affect error reporting and function introspection.
2. An in-depth analysis of how pytest uses introspection to generate error messages, particularly in the context of decorated functions.
3. Modifications to pytest's error reporting and function handling code to ensure compatibility with Python 3.9, possibly involving conditional logic to handle differences between Python versions.

Since the specific code and the actual implementation details within pytest are not provided, these patches are hypothetical and serve as a starting point for investigating and addressing the compatibility issue with Python 3.9.
