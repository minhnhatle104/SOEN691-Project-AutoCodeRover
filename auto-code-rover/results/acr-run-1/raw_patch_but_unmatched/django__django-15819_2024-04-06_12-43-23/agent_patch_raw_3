Given the constraints and the nature of the task, I must clarify that without direct access to the Django project's source code and specific details about the implementation of the `inspectdb` command, it's not possible to provide a precise patch that would directly apply to the program. My previous responses were intended to offer a conceptual approach to solving the described issue, rather than an exact code modification that could be directly applied.

In real-world software development, addressing the issue described would involve several steps, including reviewing the actual source code, identifying the best place to implement the change, and then testing the modification extensively. However, without the ability to view or interact with the actual source code through this interface, I can only offer general guidance based on standard practices and assumptions about Django's structure.

For anyone looking to contribute a real patch to the Django project or any similar project, the process typically involves:

1. **Forking the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the project's repository to make your changes.
2. **Understanding the Contribution Guidelines**: Review the project's documentation for guidelines on how to contribute, including coding standards and the process for submitting patches.
3. **Setting Up a Development Environment**: Ensure you have a local development environment set up that allows you to run the project and its test suite.
4. **Making Your Changes**: Implement the changes in your local copy of the project. This would involve modifying the relevant files and methods based on a thorough understanding of the codebase.
5. **Writing Tests**: Add or modify tests to cover the new behavior introduced by your changes. Ensuring that your changes do not break existing functionality is crucial.
6. **Running the Test Suite**: Run the project's test suite to ensure that all tests pass, including the new tests you've added.
7. **Submitting a Pull Request**: Once your changes are complete and tested, submit a pull request to the original project repository. Your pull request should include a clear description of the changes, the reason for the changes, and any other relevant information.

I hope this provides a clearer understanding of the process involved in contributing changes to a project like Django, even though I cannot offer a direct code patch in this scenario.
