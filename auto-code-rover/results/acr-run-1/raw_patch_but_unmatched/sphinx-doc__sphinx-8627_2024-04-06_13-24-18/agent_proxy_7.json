Based on the instructions and the need to directly address the issue with valid search API calls, let's focus on constructing appropriate and specific search API calls that could theoretically be used to investigate the issue with `struct.Struct` type annotations not being resolved by Sphinx's autodoc. Here are the corrected and valid search API calls based on the scenario described:\n\n1. **Search for Documentation on Handling `struct.Struct` in Sphinx**:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"sphinx autodoc struct.Struct\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for Any Sphinx Configuration Examples or Issues Related to `struct.Struct`**:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"conf.py sphinx struct.Struct\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for Custom Sphinx Extensions That Might Handle `struct.Struct` Better**:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"sphinx extension struct.Struct\")\n   ```\n\nThese search API calls are constructed with the intention of finding more information within a codebase or documentation that could help address the issue of `struct.Struct` type annotations not being properly resolved by Sphinx's autodoc. They are hypothetical and designed to illustrate the kind of queries that might be useful in a real-world scenario where such an API is available for searching through a project's documentation or codebase.\n\nPlease note, in the context of this platform, these API calls are illustrative and cannot be executed directly. They are intended to demonstrate an approach to gathering more information about handling specific Python types within Sphinx documentation."
