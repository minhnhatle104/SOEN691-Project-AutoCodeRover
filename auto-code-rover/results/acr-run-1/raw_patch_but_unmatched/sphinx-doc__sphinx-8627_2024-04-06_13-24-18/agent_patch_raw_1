Given the nature of the issue with Sphinx's autodoc not being able to resolve `struct.Struct` type annotations, and without direct access to specific files or code snippets that need to be patched, I'll provide a theoretical patch based on common practices for addressing documentation issues related to type annotations in Sphinx. This solution involves creating a Sphinx extension to handle `struct.Struct` type annotations more gracefully.

Please note, the actual implementation may require adjustments based on your project's specific setup and the version of Sphinx you are using.

# modification 1
```python
<file>docs/conf.py</file>
<original># Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings.</original>
<patched># Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
    'resolve_struct_extension',  # Assuming 'resolve_struct_extension.py' is at the root of the 'docs' directory.
]</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>docs/resolve_struct_extension.py</file>
<original># This file would be newly created, so there's no original code.</original>
<patched>from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from sphinx.ext.autodoc import DataDocumenter

def setup(app: Sphinx):
    app.add_autodocumenter(StructDocumenter)

class StructDocumenter(DataDocumenter):
    objtype = 'struct'
    directivetype = 'data'
    priority = 10 + DataDocumenter.priority

    @classmethod
    def can_document_member(cls, member, membername, isattr, parent):
        return isinstance(member, struct.Struct)

    def add_directive_header(self, sig):
        super().add_directive_header(sig)
        self.add_line('   :annotation: = struct.Struct', self.get_sourcename())</patched>
```

This theoretical patch consists of two modifications:

1. **Modification 1**: Updates the `conf.py` file used by Sphinx for documentation generation. It adds a custom extension named `resolve_struct_extension`, which you will create to handle `struct.Struct` type annotations. This assumes the extension file is named `resolve_struct_extension.py` and is located in the `docs` directory of your project.

2. **Modification 2**: Creates a new file `resolve_struct_extension.py` that defines a custom Sphinx documenter for handling `struct.Struct` instances. This documenter extends `DataDocumenter` to specifically target `struct.Struct` objects, ensuring they are documented correctly. The `add_directive_header` method is overridden to add a custom annotation indicating the use of `struct.Struct`.

Please adjust the file paths and extension names as necessary for your project's structure. This solution is theoretical and may require further customization to work seamlessly with your specific Sphinx setup and documentation requirements.
