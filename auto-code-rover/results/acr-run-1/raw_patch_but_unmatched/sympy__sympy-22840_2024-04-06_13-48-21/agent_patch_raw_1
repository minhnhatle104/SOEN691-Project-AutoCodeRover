Given the context and the issue described, it seems the core problem does not lie directly within the implementations of `cse`, `CodeBlock.cse`, or `MatrixSymbol` but rather in how expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` indexing are prepared and processed by `cse`. The issue description and the provided code snippet suggest that the handling of `MatrixSymbol` indexing might not be aligning with the expectations when passed through the `cse` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

Since the specific implementation details of the `sub_in_matrixsymbols` function are not provided and it's not directly found in the codebase, the patch will focus on a conceptual fix that could be applied to the way `MatrixSymbol` expressions are handled before and after the `cse` process. This approach is speculative and aims to provide a direction for resolving the issue based on the provided context.

This modification proposes a conceptual approach to preprocess expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` indexing before they are passed to the `cse` function. The idea is to substitute `MatrixSymbol` entries with individual symbols, making the expressions more amenable to common subexpression elimination. This approach requires integrating the `sub_in_matrixsymbols` function (or a similar logic) into the workflow where expressions are prepared for `cse`.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on the understanding that the issue arises from how `MatrixSymbol` expressions are handled in the context of `cse`. Actual implementation may require adjustments based on the specific details of the project and the `sub_in_matrixsymbols` function's role within it.
