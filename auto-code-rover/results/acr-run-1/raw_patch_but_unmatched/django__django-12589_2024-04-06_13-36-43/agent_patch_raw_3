Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch that matches the original program without access to the specific codebase or error details. My guidance is based on common practices and general advice for addressing issues in Django projects, particularly those involving complex queries and "GROUP BY" clauses.

For issues related to ambiguous column references in Django, especially when upgrading between versions as mentioned, the resolution often involves ensuring that your queries are explicitly specifying fields and using aliases where necessary to avoid ambiguity. However, without seeing the exact structure of your models and the specific query causing the issue, it's challenging to provide a precise solution.

### Suggested Next Steps:

1. **Review Django ORM Changes**: Check the Django release notes for versions between 2.2.11 and 3.0.4 for any changes in ORM behavior that might affect your queries.

2. **Query Refactoring**: Attempt to refactor the query by explicitly specifying field names and using aliases. Ensure that annotations, subqueries, and aggregations are clearly defined to avoid any ambiguity.

3. **Consult Django Community**: If the issue persists, consider posting a detailed description of the problem, including the models, the query, and the exact error message, on platforms like Stack Overflow or the Django Users mailing list. The Django community can be an excellent resource for specific issues like this.

4. **Debugging Tools**: Utilize Django's debugging tools or log the generated SQL query to understand how Django is interpreting your query. This might provide insights into where the ambiguity arises.

I apologize for not being able to provide a direct patch. The resolution of such issues often requires a detailed understanding of the specific codebase and the context in which the error occurs.
