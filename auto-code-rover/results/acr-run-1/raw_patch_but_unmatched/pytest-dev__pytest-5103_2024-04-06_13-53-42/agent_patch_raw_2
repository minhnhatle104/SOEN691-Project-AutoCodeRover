Given the constraints and the nature of the request, without access to the actual source code and specific implementation details of pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism, I'll provide a conceptual approach to address the issue. This approach will focus on enhancing error reporting for `all` or `any` assertions by conceptually unrolling iterables. Since I can't match the original program exactly, the following is a high-level illustration of how one might think about implementing such a feature.

Please note, this is a hypothetical patch and may not directly apply to the pytest codebase without modifications.

# Conceptual Patch

Since the exact code cannot be matched to the original program, let's outline a strategy that could be explored in an actual implementation:

## Strategy for Enhancing Error Reporting for `all`/`any` Assertions

1. **Identify Assertions Involving `all` or `any`**: The first step is to modify the assertion rewriting mechanism to detect when an assertion involves the `all` or `any` functions. This could involve parsing the assertion expression to identify these specific cases.

2. **Rewrite Assertions to Capture Individual Failures**: For assertions identified as involving `all` or `any`, rewrite these to iterate over the iterable and assert each item individually. This allows capturing and reporting the specific item(s) that fail the condition.

3. **Enhance Error Reporting**: When an individual item assertion fails, enhance the error message to include details about the failing item. This could involve modifying the error reporting mechanism to check for this specific type of rewritten assertion and format the error message accordingly.

## Conceptual Implementation

```python
# Hypothetical modification in the assertion rewriting mechanism
def rewrite_assert_all_any(expression):
    # This is a pseudo-code function that illustrates the concept of rewriting
    # 'all' or 'any' assertions to improve error reporting.
    if "all(" in expression or "any(" in expression:
        # Parse the expression to extract the iterable and the condition
        # This is a simplified illustration; actual implementation would require robust parsing
        iterable_part = "extracted_iterable"
        condition_part = "extracted_condition"
        
        # Rewrite the assertion to individually assert each item
        rewritten_expression = f"""
for item in {iterable_part}:
    assert {condition_part}, "Assertion failed for item: {{item}}"
"""
        return rewritten_expression
    else:
        return expression  # No modification for other types of assertions
```

## Considerations

- **Performance**: Iterating over each item in the iterable and asserting individually could have performance implications, especially for large iterables. This approach should be optional or configurable.

- **Complexity of Conditions**: Assertions involving complex conditions or nested `all`/`any` calls would require more sophisticated parsing and rewriting logic.

- **Integration with pytest**: Integrating this feature into pytest would involve modifying the assertion rewriting mechanism (`rewrite.py`) and potentially other components responsible for parsing assertions and formatting error messages.

This conceptual patch is intended to illustrate a possible approach to enhancing error reporting for `all` or `any` assertions in pytest. Actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of pytest's internals, robust testing, and consideration of edge cases and performance impacts.
