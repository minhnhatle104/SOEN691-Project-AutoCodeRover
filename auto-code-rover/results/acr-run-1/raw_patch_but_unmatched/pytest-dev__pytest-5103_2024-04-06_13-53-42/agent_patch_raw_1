Given the issue description and the context from the hypothetical search results, let's draft a conceptual patch to enhance error reporting for `all` or `any` assertions in pytest. This patch aims to unroll the iterable in such assertions to provide more informative error messages, similar to the detailed feedback achieved with a for-loop. Please note, the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full context of the pytest codebase and testing.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original snippet, as the exact implementation details are not provided.
def _rewrite_assert(expr, msg):
    # Code to rewrite assert statements
    pass
</original>
<patched>
# Import necessary for the patch
from typing import Iterable

def _rewrite_assert(expr, msg):
    # Enhanced code to rewrite assert statements, specifically targeting 'all' and 'any' assertions
    if "all(" in expr or "any(" in expr:
        # Assuming expr is a string representation of the assertion. This will need parsing and handling based on actual implementation.
        iterable_expr = expr[expr.find("(")+1:expr.rfind(")")]
        return f"for _item in {iterable_expr}:\n    assert _item, 'Failed assertion for item: {_item}'\n" + msg
    else:
        # Original handling for other assertions
        pass
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# Placeholder for the original code snippet where assertion rewriting is initialized or configured.
def setup_assertion_rewrite():
    # Setup code for assertion rewriting
    pass
</original>
<patched>
def setup_assertion_rewrite():
    # Setup code for assertion rewriting
    # Adding a hypothetical hook or configuration option to enable detailed error reporting for 'all' or 'any' assertions.
    enable_detailed_iterable_assert_errors = True  # This could be made configurable through pytest.ini
    if enable_detailed_iterable_assert_errors:
        # Adjust the assertion rewrite mechanism to include the enhanced error reporting.
        # This might involve setting a flag or modifying the rewrite rules.
        pass
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are conceptual and aim to illustrate the approach to solving the issue described. The actual implementation would require a deep understanding of the pytest codebase, specifically how assertions are parsed, rewritten, and executed. Additionally, thorough testing would be necessary to ensure that the enhancement does not introduce regressions or adversely affect performance.
