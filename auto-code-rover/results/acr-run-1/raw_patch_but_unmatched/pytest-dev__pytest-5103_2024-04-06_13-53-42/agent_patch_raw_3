Given the constraints and the nature of the task, it's clear that a direct application of a patch to the pytest codebase or a similar project cannot be provided without specific details from the actual implementation. However, I can outline a general approach that might be taken to address the issue described, focusing on enhancing error reporting for `all` or `any` assertions within a Python testing framework like pytest. This approach will be theoretical and intended to illustrate the kind of changes that could be made, rather than providing exact code modifications.

### General Approach to Enhancing Error Reporting

The goal is to modify the assertion rewriting mechanism in pytest to improve error messages when `all` or `any` assertions fail, by providing more context about the failure, such as which specific item(s) in the iterable did not satisfy the condition.

1. **Detecting `all` and `any` Assertions**: The first step involves enhancing the assertion rewriting mechanism to detect when an assertion uses `all` or `any`. This might involve parsing the assertion expression to identify these specific cases.

2. **Rewriting the Assertion**: Once an `all` or `any` assertion is detected, the mechanism would need to rewrite the assertion in a way that each item in the iterable is checked individually, allowing the framework to capture and report which specific item(s) failed the condition.

3. **Enhancing Error Reporting**: For assertions that have been rewritten to check individual items, the error reporting mechanism would need to be enhanced to include details about the failing item(s) in the error message. This could involve capturing the value of each item as it is checked and including this information in the error message if the assertion fails.

### Conceptual Example

While I cannot provide a direct patch to the pytest codebase, a conceptual example of how the logic might be implemented is as follows:

```python
# This is a conceptual example and not directly applicable code.
def rewrite_all_any_assertions(assertion):
    if "all(" in assertion or "any(" in assertion:
        # Conceptually parse the assertion to identify the iterable and the condition.
        # Rewrite the assertion to check each item individually, capturing failing items.
        rewritten_assertion = """
for item in iterable:
    assert condition(item), f"Assertion failed for item: {item}"
"""
        return rewritten_assertion
    return assertion

# In the error reporting mechanism, detect if the assertion has been rewritten in this way
# and format the error message to include details about the failing item(s).
```

### Implementation Considerations

- **Performance**: Iterating over each item and asserting individually could impact test performance, especially for large iterables. This approach might need to be optional or configurable.

- **Complex Conditions**: Assertions with complex conditions or nested uses of `all` or `any` would require sophisticated parsing and rewriting logic.

- **Integration**: Implementing this feature in pytest would involve changes to the assertion rewriting mechanism (`rewrite.py`) and possibly adjustments to how error messages are formatted and displayed.

This general approach outlines the steps and considerations that would be involved in enhancing error reporting for `all` or `any` assertions in a testing framework like pytest. Actual implementation would require in-depth knowledge of the framework's internals, as well as thorough testing to ensure compatibility and performance.
