Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I cannot directly access or modify actual files or their contents within your project. My previous response provided a hypothetical patch based on a typical Django migration issue related to the order of operations. Since I can't access the specific migration file or its contents, the example provided was illustrative, aiming to demonstrate how one might reorder operations in a Django migration file to address the described issue.

In a real-world scenario, to apply a fix, you would:

1. Locate the specific migration file within your Django project that includes the operations for the `LookImage` model. This file is typically found in the `migrations` directory of the Django app that defines the `LookImage` model.

2. Open the migration file and manually adjust the order of the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations, ensuring that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` comes before any `AddIndex` operations that involve the `_order` field.

Since I can't provide a direct patch to match your original program, I recommend following the conceptual guidance provided to make the necessary adjustments in your project's migration file. Always ensure to backup your migration files before making changes and test the adjusted migration in a development environment to verify that the issue is resolved.
