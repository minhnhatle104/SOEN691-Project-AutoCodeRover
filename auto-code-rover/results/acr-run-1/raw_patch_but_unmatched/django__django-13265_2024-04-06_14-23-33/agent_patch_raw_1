Given the nature of the issue described and the insights from the Django migration system's behavior, a hypothetical patch can be proposed to address the ordering problem in the migration file for the `LookImage` model. This patch assumes the migration file is incorrectly ordering the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations.

Please note, the actual file path and original code snippet cannot be precisely provided due to the limitations of this environment. However, a conceptual patch can be outlined based on the standard structure of Django migration files.

# modification 1
```python
<file>migrations/XXXX_auto_lookimage.py</file>
<original>
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),
),
migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
    name='lookimage',
    order_with_respect_to='look',
),
</original>
<patched>
migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
    name='lookimage',
    order_with_respect_to='look',
),
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),
),
</patched>
```

This modification assumes the migration file named `XXXX_auto_lookimage.py` (where `XXXX` represents the migration's timestamp or sequence number) contains the operations in an order that leads to the issue described. The patch swaps the order of the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations, ensuring that the `_order` field is properly handled before attempting to add an index that includes it.

Remember, this is a conceptual patch. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific migration file's content and the project's state. Always test migration changes in a development environment before applying them to production to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce new issues.
