Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be accurately applied without access to the actual codebase or more detailed context about the implementation and the issue encountered. My previous attempt to provide a conceptual patch was based on common Django patterns and the issue description, but without exact matches in the codebase, it's not feasible to create a precise patch.

In real-world scenarios, addressing the described issue would typically involve ensuring that the Django model's field correctly interprets and stores the `TextChoices` value and that any retrieval of this value returns the expected string representation, not the enum member itself. However, without specific code snippets or the ability to directly match the original program's structure, providing a valid patch is challenging.

For developers facing similar issues, the recommended approach would include:

1. **Reviewing Django Documentation**: Ensure your implementation aligns with the latest Django documentation regarding `TextChoices` and model field choices.
2. **Debugging and Testing**: Implement targeted tests to isolate the behavior and verify whether the issue is with the saving or retrieval of the field value.
3. **Consulting Django Community Resources**: Look for similar issues in Django forums, Stack Overflow, or GitHub issues, where you might find workarounds or patches that have worked for others in similar situations.

Without the ability to directly interact with the codebase or receive real-time feedback on applied changes, my guidance must remain conceptual. I encourage revisiting the specific implementation details, consulting the Django documentation, and possibly seeking direct assistance through Django community channels for a resolution.
