Given the constraints and the inability to directly modify the existing program as per the previous instructions, a more general approach to resolving the issue would be to provide guidance on how to work around the limitation without directly patching the library's source code. This workaround involves manually handling the draggable state of legends (or annotations) before pickling and restoring it after unpickling, which can be done in the user's code.

Since a direct patch to the library's source code cannot be applied based on the provided instructions, below is a conceptual workaround that users can implement in their own projects to bypass the issue:

### Workaround Concept

Before pickling a figure that contains a draggable legend, disable the draggable feature. After unpickling, re-enable the draggable feature if necessary. This approach requires manual intervention in the pickling and unpickling process but avoids modifying the Matplotlib library directly.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pickle

# Function to disable draggable legends in a figure
def disable_draggable_legends(fig):
    for ax in fig.get_axes():
        legend = ax.get_legend()
        if legend is not None:
            legend.set_draggable(False)

# Function to enable draggable legends in a figure
def enable_draggable_legends(fig):
    for ax in fig.get_axes():
        legend = ax.get_legend()
        if legend is not None:
            legend.set_draggable(True)

# Your plotting code
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
time = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
speed = [40, 43, 45, 47, 48]
ax.plot(time, speed, label="speed")
leg = ax.legend()
leg.set_draggable(True)

# Disable draggable legends before pickling
disable_draggable_legends(fig)

# Pickle the figure
pickled_fig = pickle.dumps(fig)

# Unpickle the figure
fig = pickle.loads(pickled_fig)

# Re-enable draggable legends after unpickling
enable_draggable_legends(fig)

plt.show()
```

This workaround manually toggles the draggable state of legends before and after the pickling process, ensuring that the figure can be pickled without encountering the serialization error. While not as elegant as a direct patch to the library, it allows users to continue working with draggable legends and pickling without waiting for a library update.
