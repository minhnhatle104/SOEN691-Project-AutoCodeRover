This patch moves the emission of the `xlim_changed` event outside of the conditional block that checks for `emit` being `True` for the original axis. It ensures that the `xlim_changed` event is also emitted for all shared axes, but avoids recursion by keeping the `emit=False` in the `set_xlim` call for the shared axes. This way, the callbacks for `xlim_changed` are triggered for all axes sharing the x-axis without causing an infinite loop.
