Given the nature of the issue with pretty printing of `sympy.vector` objects and without direct access to the specific parts of the codebase where the issue originates, I'll propose a hypothetical patch based on common practices in handling pretty printing and vector objects in Python. This patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the described issue.

### Hypothetical Patch for Pretty Printing Issue

The issue seems to involve the pretty printing system not handling `sympy.vector` objects correctly, possibly due to the way these objects are represented or integrated into the pretty printing process. A common approach to resolving such issues is to ensure that the objects have a suitable `__repr__` or `_sympystr` method that the pretty printer can use to generate the correct output.

#### Modification 1: Enhancing Vector Object Representation

```python
<file>sympy/vector/coordsysrect.py</file>
<original>
class CoordSys3D(Basic):
    ...
    def _sympystr(self, printer):
        ...
</original>
<patched>
class CoordSys3D(Basic):
    ...
    def _sympystr(self, printer):
        return "CoordSys3D({})".format(self.name)
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Updating Pretty Printer for Vector Objects

Assuming the pretty printing issue might also involve how vector expressions are handled during the pretty printing process, we can ensure that the pretty printer checks for `sympy.vector` objects and calls the appropriate method to get their string representation.

```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>
def _print_Basic(self, expr):
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def _print_Basic(self, expr):
    if isinstance(expr, CoordSys3D):
        return expr._sympystr(self)
    ...
</patched>
```

#### Modification 3: Ensuring Integration with `init_printing`

Finally, ensuring that the `init_printing` function properly integrates with the updated pretty printing logic for vector objects.

```python
<file>sympy/interactive/printing.py</file>
<original>
def init_printing(...):
    ...
    if pretty_print:
        ...
</original>
<patched>
def init_printing(...):
    ...
    if pretty_print:
        from sympy.vector import CoordSys3D
        if isinstance(expr, CoordSys3D):
            return expr._sympystr(self)
        ...
</patched>
```

### Note

These modifications are speculative and aim to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the pretty printing issue based on common patterns in handling object representation and pretty printing in Python. Actual implementation details may vary based on the specific architecture and design of the SymPy library. It's recommended to review the SymPy documentation, consult with the development community, and thoroughly test any changes.
