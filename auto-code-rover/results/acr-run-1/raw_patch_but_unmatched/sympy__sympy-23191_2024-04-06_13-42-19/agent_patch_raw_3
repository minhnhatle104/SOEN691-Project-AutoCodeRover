Given the constraints and understanding that a precise patch cannot be directly applied without specific details from the actual SymPy codebase, and acknowledging the limitations in providing an exact match for the original program, I'll offer a general guidance on how such issues might typically be addressed in a Python library like SymPy. This guidance is meant to illustrate the approach rather than provide a direct code patch.

### General Guidance for Addressing the Issue

The issue at hand involves the pretty printing functionality within SymPy, particularly when dealing with `sympy.vector` objects. The described problem suggests that the output is not formatted correctly, potentially due to how the pretty printing system interprets these objects.

1. **Enhance Object Representation**:
   - Ensure that all vector-related objects (e.g., instances of `CoordSys3D`, vector expressions) implement a clear and concise `__repr__` or `_sympystr` method. These methods are crucial for the pretty printer to understand how to represent these objects as strings.

2. **Update Pretty Printing Logic**:
   - Modify the pretty printing logic to better handle vector objects. This could involve adjusting the pretty printer's behavior when encountering objects that represent vectors, ensuring that it calls the appropriate method (`_sympystr` or `__repr__`) to get a string representation suitable for pretty printing.

3. **Verify Integration with `init_printing`**:
   - Ensure that the `init_printing` function is correctly set up to utilize the updated logic for vector objects. This might involve configuring options or flags that tell the pretty printer to use the enhanced representation methods for vector objects.

### Conceptual Patch

Since I cannot provide a direct patch, here's a conceptual outline that might guide the implementation:

```python
# This is a conceptual outline and not a direct patch

# For vector-related objects, ensure they have a suitable representation method:
class CoordSys3D(Basic):
    def __repr__(self):
        # Return a string representation that is informative and suitable for pretty printing
        return f"CoordSys3D(Name: {self.name})"

# In the pretty printing logic, ensure vector objects are handled correctly:
def pretty_print_vector_object(obj):
    # This function would be part of the pretty printing system
    # It checks if the object is a vector object and uses its representation method
    if isinstance(obj, CoordSys3D):
        return obj.__repr__()

# In the init_printing function, ensure it's configured to handle vector objects correctly:
def init_printing():
    # Configuration code here
    # Ensure that vector objects are directed to the updated pretty printing logic
```

### Final Note

This guidance and conceptual outline are meant to provide a direction for addressing the pretty printing issue with vector objects in SymPy. Actual implementation would require a detailed review of the SymPy codebase, understanding the specific mechanisms of the pretty printing system, and testing to ensure that the changes resolve the issue without introducing new ones.
