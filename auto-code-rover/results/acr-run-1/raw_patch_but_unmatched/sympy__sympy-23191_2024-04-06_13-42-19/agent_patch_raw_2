Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details or the ability to execute real-time queries against the SymPy codebase, providing a precise patch is challenging. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to addressing the issue based on standard practices for enhancing pretty printing functionality in Python, particularly for complex objects like those found in SymPy's vector module.

### Conceptual Approach to Patch

The issue appears to be related to the pretty printing system's handling of `sympy.vector` objects, possibly due to the way these objects are represented or integrated into the pretty printing process. A common solution involves ensuring that objects have a suitable representation method that the pretty printer can use to generate the correct output, and that the pretty printing system is aware of how to handle these specific object types.

#### Ensuring Proper Representation of Vector Objects

For `CoordSys3D` and other vector objects, ensuring they have a `__repr__` or `_sympystr` method that returns a string representation suitable for pretty printing is crucial. This method should be designed to return a representation that is both informative and formatted in a way that aligns with pretty printing standards.

```python
# Hypothetical example for illustration purposes
class CoordSys3D(Basic):
    def _sympystr(self, printer):
        # Return a formatted string representation of the CoordSys3D object
        return "CoordSys3D({})".format(self.name)
```

#### Updating Pretty Printer Logic

The pretty printing logic should be updated to recognize and correctly handle `sympy.vector` objects. This might involve adding or modifying a method in the pretty printing system to check for these objects and use their custom representation methods.

```python
# Hypothetical example for illustration purposes
def _print_Vector(self, expr):
    # Check if the expression is an instance of a vector object and handle accordingly
    if isinstance(expr, Vector):
        return expr._sympystr(self)
```

#### Integrating with `init_printing`

The `init_printing` function should be configured to utilize the updated pretty printing logic for vector objects. This ensures that when pretty printing is initialized, it is aware of how to handle `sympy.vector` objects correctly.

```python
# Hypothetical example for illustration purposes
def init_printing(...):
    ...
    # Configure pretty printing to use the updated logic for vector objects
    ...
```

### Note

This conceptual approach outlines a general strategy for addressing the issue based on the description provided and common practices for handling pretty printing in Python. The actual implementation may vary and should be adapted to fit the specific architecture and design of the SymPy library. It's important to review the SymPy documentation, consult with the development community, and thoroughly test any changes to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new ones.
