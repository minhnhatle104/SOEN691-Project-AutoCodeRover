            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the classes and methods involved in the issue. Specifically, we should look into the `CoordSys3D`, `Del`, and the `pprint` function, as these are directly mentioned in the issue description. Additionally, understanding how the `Integral` and `cross` methods are implemented could provide insights into why the output is jumbled. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CoordSys3D\")` - To get more information about the `CoordSys3D` class which is used to define the coordinate system and its unit vectors.\n2. `search_class(\"Del\")` - To understand the `Del` class, which seems to be related to differential operators in the context of vector calculus.\n3. `search_method(\"pprint\")` - To explore how the `pprint` function is implemented, as it is directly involved in displaying the output which is reported to be buggy.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"cross\", \"Del\")` - To investigate the implementation of the `cross` method within the `Del` class, as it is used in the calculation of `vecE`.\n5. `search_method(\"doit\")` - Since `doit` is called on the result of `Integral(delop.cross(vecB/mu).doit(), t)`, understanding its implementation might reveal why the output is not as expected."
