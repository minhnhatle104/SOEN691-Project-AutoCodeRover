Given the constraints of our interaction, where I can't directly access or analyze the `pmxbot` project's codebase, and considering the feedback that the hypothetical patches provided do not match the original program, it's clear that creating a precise and applicable patch without specific details from the codebase is challenging. 

In a real-world scenario, addressing the issue described would involve a detailed review of the project's use of `importlib`, the structure of namespace packages, and the initialization and configuration of the logging system, especially how and where `Logger.store` is set. 

Without direct access to the code and specific search results, the best course of action would be to:

1. **Review the Project's Import Patterns**: Look for inconsistencies or redundancies in how modules, especially `pmxbot.logging`, are imported. This includes checking for both direct imports and dynamic imports via `importlib`.

2. **Ensure Singleton Behavior for Critical Components**: For components like the `Logger` that should ideally be initialized once, ensure that their initialization code enforces singleton behavior, preventing multiple instances from being created inadvertently.

3. **Consolidate and Standardize Logging Configuration**: Ensure that the logging configuration, including the initialization of `Logger.store`, is done in a single, well-defined location that runs as part of the project's startup sequence.

4. **Utilize Python's Module Caching**: Python's import system caches modules in `sys.modules` after they are first imported. Ensure that this mechanism is not being circumvented by unnecessary reloading or dynamic importing of modules that should be singletons within the application context.

5. **Engage with the Developer Community**: If the project is open source or has an active community, consider reaching out for support. Other contributors may have encountered and resolved similar issues or can offer insights based on a deeper understanding of the project's architecture.

Given these general guidelines, the resolution to the issue would require a more interactive and iterative approach, involving code review, testing, and possibly refactoring to address the root cause of the problem effectively.
