Given the constraints of our interaction, where direct access to the codebase and specific details about the implementation are not available, and acknowledging the challenges in providing a precise patch without this access, it's clear that creating an actionable patch for the `pmxbot` project's issue as described is beyond the scope of our current capabilities.

In a real-world scenario, to effectively address the issue of a module being imported twice and the `Logger.store` attribute not being set as expected, a developer would likely take the following steps:

1. **Deep Dive into the Codebase**: Manually review the code related to module imports, especially those involving `importlib` and the setup of namespace packages according to PEP 420. This includes tracing how `pmxbot.logging` is imported across different parts of the application.

2. **Identify and Isolate the Issue**: Use debugging tools to trace the application's execution flow, focusing on the initialization process where `Logger.store` should be set and where `pmxbot.logging` is imported. This could help identify where the duplication occurs or why the initialization does not have the expected effect.

3. **Consult Documentation and Community Resources**: Review Python's documentation on `importlib` and namespace packages for insights into common pitfalls or best practices. Additionally, reaching out to the developer community, including forums or the project's issue tracker, might reveal known issues or advice from others who have faced similar challenges.

4. **Implement and Test Potential Fixes**: Based on the insights gained from the steps above, implement potential fixes, which might involve adjusting how and where imports are done, ensuring `Logger.store` is correctly initialized in a singleton manner, or restructuring parts of the code to better align with Python's module and import system.

5. **Review and Collaborate**: If possible, review the changes with other contributors or through code review processes to ensure that the fix addresses the issue without introducing new problems. Collaboration can also provide additional insights or alternative approaches to the problem.

Without the ability to directly interact with the codebase or execute specific search API calls, these steps represent a conceptual approach to diagnosing and resolving the described issue. Each step would need to be adapted to the specifics of the `pmxbot` project and the actual code involved.
