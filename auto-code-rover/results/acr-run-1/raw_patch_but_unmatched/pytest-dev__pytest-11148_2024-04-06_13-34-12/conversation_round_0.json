To do so, I've needed to switch to `importlib` for the `import-mode` and re-organize the tests to avoid import errors on the tests.\nYet even after working around these issues, the tests are failing when the effect of `core.initialize()` doesn't seem to have had any effect.\nInvestigating deeper, I see that initializer is executed and performs its actions (setting a class variable `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store`), but when that happens, there are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present, one in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`:\n```\n=========================================================================== test session starts ===========================================================================\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.11.1, pytest-7.2.0, pluggy-1.0.0\ncachedir: .tox/python/.pytest_cache\nrootdir: /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot, configfile: pytest.ini\nplugins: black-0.3.12, mypy-0.10.3, jaraco.test-5.3.0, checkdocs-2.9.0, flake8-1.1.1, enabler-2.0.0, jaraco.mongodb-11.2.1, pmxbot-1122.14.3.dev13+g7f189ad\ncollected 421 items / 180 deselected / 241 selected\nrun-last-failure: rerun previous 240 failures (skipped 14 files)\ntests/unit/test_commands.py E\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> traceback >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\ncls = <class 'tests.unit.test_commands.TestCommands'>\n@classmethod\ndef setup_class(cls):\npath = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\nconfigfile = os.path.join(path, 'testconf.yaml')\nconfig = pmxbot.dictlib.ConfigDict.from_yaml(configfile)\ncls.bot = core.initialize(config)\n>       logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\nE       AttributeError: type object 'Logger' has no attribute 'store'\ntests/unit/test_commands.py:37: AttributeError\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> entering PDB >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> PDB post_mortem (IO-capturing turned off) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n> /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/tests/unit/test_commands.py(37)setup_class()\n-> logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\n(Pdb) logging.Logger\n<class 'pmxbot.logging.Logger'>\n(Pdb) logging\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\n(Pdb) import sys\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging']\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging'] is logging\nFalse\n```\nI haven't yet made a minimal reproducer, but I wanted to first capture this condition.\n</issue>"
