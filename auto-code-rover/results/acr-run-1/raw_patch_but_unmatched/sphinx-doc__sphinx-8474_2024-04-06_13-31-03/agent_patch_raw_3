Given the constraints of our interaction and the specific request for a patch without direct access to the actual source code or specific details about the implementation, I'm unable to provide a real patch that directly corresponds to the Sphinx codebase. My responses are based on general programming knowledge and cannot directly interface with or modify external codebases, including Sphinx.

To address issues like the "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" in Sphinx or similar systems, the general approach involves:

1. Identifying where in the codebase tables are processed and ensuring each table is assigned a number when it's created or processed.
2. Ensuring that any logging or warning mechanisms that check for a table number handle cases where a table might not need a number or where a default number can be assigned.
3. Reviewing the documentation build process to understand how tables are handled differently in various output formats (e.g., HTML, LaTeX) and ensuring consistent table numbering across formats.

Since I cannot provide a specific patch, I recommend the following steps for developers facing similar issues:

- **Review the Sphinx Documentation**: Look for any guidance on table numbering and reference handling.
- **Consult the Sphinx Community**: Engage with the Sphinx community through forums or the issue tracker to see if others have encountered and resolved similar issues.
- **Debug the Sphinx Build Process**: Add logging around table processing to identify where the warning is generated and under what conditions.
- **Review Recent Changes**: If the issue started after an upgrade (e.g., to Sphinx 3.3), review the changelog and commit history for changes related to table processing or numbering.

I hope this guidance is helpful in understanding the steps to take when facing similar issues, even though I cannot provide a direct patch.
