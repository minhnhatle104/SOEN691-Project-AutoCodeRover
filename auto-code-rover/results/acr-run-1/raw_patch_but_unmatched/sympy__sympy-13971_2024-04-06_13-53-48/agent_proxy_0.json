The issue seems to be related to the rendering process of sequences for display in Jupyter notebooks, which might involve methods related to printing or converting the sequence to a string.\n\nGiven this context, I will perform the following API calls to gather more information:\n\n1. **Search for the `SeqFormula` class**: This will help us understand the structure of the class and any relevant methods that might be involved in rendering the sequence for display.\n   \n   `search_class(\"SeqFormula\")`\n\n2. **Search for methods related to printing or rendering in the `SeqFormula` class**: Since the issue is related to how the sequence is displayed, methods responsible for converting the sequence to a string or rendering it might be where the issue lies.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"print\", \"SeqFormula\")`\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"_repr_latex_\", \"SeqFormula\")`\n\n3. **Search for code related to Jupyter rendering**: This will help us identify if there are specific handlers or functions that deal with rendering objects in Jupyter notebooks, which might be applying the backslash-escape to brackets.\n   \n   `search_code(\"Jupyter rendering\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at pinpointing where the issue might be originating from, whether it's within the `SeqFormula` class itself or in the broader rendering process for Jupyter notebooks."
