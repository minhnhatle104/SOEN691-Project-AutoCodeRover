Given the constraints and the inability to directly modify the existing `latex` function without matching the original program's context exactly, a more targeted approach is required. Since the direct modification suggested previously cannot be applied, let's consider an alternative approach that could potentially address the issue from a different angle, focusing on the `SeqFormula` rendering without altering the global behavior of the `latex` function.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/series/sequences.py</file>
<original>class SeqFormula(SeqExpr):
    def __new__(cls, formula, limits=None):
    ...
</original>
<patched>class SeqFormula(SeqExpr):
    def __new__(cls, formula, limits=None):
        ...
    def _repr_latex_(self):
        from sympy.printing.latex import latex
        # Use inline mode specifically for SeqFormula to avoid backslash-escaped brackets
        return latex(self, mode='inline')</patched>
```

**Explanation**: This modification introduces a `_repr_latex_` method specifically for the `SeqFormula` class. The method utilizes the existing `latex` function from `sympy.printing.latex` but explicitly sets the `mode` to `'inline'`. This mode choice aims to ensure that when `SeqFormula` objects are rendered in Jupyter notebooks, they use the `$...$` delimiters, which should help avoid the issue with backslash-escaped brackets. 

This approach targets the `SeqFormula` rendering directly, providing a more focused solution without altering the global behavior of the `latex` function or affecting other expressions. It's a safer alternative that allows for specific handling of the issue identified in the `SeqFormula` rendering within Jupyter notebooks.
