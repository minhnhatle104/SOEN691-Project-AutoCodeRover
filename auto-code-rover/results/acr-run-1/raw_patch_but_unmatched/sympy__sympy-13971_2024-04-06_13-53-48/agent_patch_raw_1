    # Patch to ensure square brackets are not backslash-escaped in Jupyter notebooks
    # This is a workaround for the specific issue with SeqFormula rendering
    if "mode" not in settings:
        # Default mode for sequences to 'inline' to avoid backslash-escaping in Jupyter
        settings["mode"] = "inline"
    return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)</patched>
```

**Explanation**: This patch sets the default `mode` to `'inline'` for the `latex` function if it is not explicitly provided in the settings. The `inline` mode uses `$...$` for delimiting LaTeX, which should not have issues with backslash-escaped brackets in Jupyter notebooks. This approach aims to address the specific issue with `SeqFormula` rendering without altering the behavior for other expressions where a different mode might be explicitly set or desired. 

Please note, this is a generalized solution and might need further refinement based on broader testing across different types of expressions and in various environments to ensure it does not introduce unintended side effects.
