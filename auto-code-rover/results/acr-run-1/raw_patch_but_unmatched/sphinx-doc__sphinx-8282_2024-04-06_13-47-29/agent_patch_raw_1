Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'll create a hypothetical patch based on the description of the issue with `autodoc_typehints` not affecting overloaded callables in Sphinx documentation. This patch is speculative and aims to illustrate how one might approach solving the reported problem based on common practices in handling type hints and documentation in Python projects.

Please note, the actual implementation in Sphinx may differ significantly, and this patch should be validated and tested within the Sphinx development environment.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py</file>
<original>
def process_signature(app, what, name, obj, options, signature, return_annotation):
    # This function processes the signature and return annotation
    # The original implementation might not properly handle overloaded functions
    ...
</original>
<patched>
from typing import get_type_hints

def process_signature(app, what, name, obj, options, signature, return_annotation):
    # Enhanced to handle overloaded functions by fetching type hints directly
    if hasattr(obj, '__overloads__'):
        # Assuming '__overloads__' is a hypothetical attribute holding overloaded versions
        type_hints = get_type_hints(obj.__overloads__[0])
    else:
        type_hints = get_type_hints(obj)
    
    # Use type_hints for further processing instead of relying solely on signature and return_annotation
    ...
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
class Documenter:
    # This is a part of the Documenter class responsible for generating documentation
    def add_directive_header(self, sig):
        # Method that adds the directive header, might not account for overloaded functions
        ...
</original>
<patched>
class Documenter:
    def add_directive_header(self, sig):
        # Updated to check for overloaded functions and adjust the signature accordingly
        if hasattr(self.object, '__overloads__'):
            for overload in self.object.__overloads__:
                self.directive.result.append(self.format_signature(overload))
        else:
            self.directive.result.append(self.format_signature(sig))
</patched>
```

Please remember, these modifications are speculative and based on a hypothetical understanding of how Sphinx's autodoc extension might be implemented. The actual source code of Sphinx and its handling of overloaded functions and type hints could be significantly different. Before applying any changes, one should review the actual source code, understand the existing implementation, and test any modifications thoroughly in a development environment.
