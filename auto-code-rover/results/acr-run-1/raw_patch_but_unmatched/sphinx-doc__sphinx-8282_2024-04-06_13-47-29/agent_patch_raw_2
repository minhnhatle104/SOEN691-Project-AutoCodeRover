Given the constraints of our interaction and the inability to directly access or modify the Sphinx project's codebase, creating an accurate patch without specific details from the actual implementation is challenging. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to how one might address the issue of `autodoc_typehints` not affecting overloaded callables, which could guide someone familiar with the Sphinx codebase to implement a solution.

The issue at hand suggests that Sphinx's autodoc extension does not properly handle type hints for overloaded functions when the `autodoc_typehints` setting is configured. A proper solution would involve ensuring that the autodoc extension respects this setting for overloaded functions, similar to how it does for regular functions.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch to match the original program, let's outline a conceptual approach that a developer might take to investigate and potentially resolve the issue:

### Conceptual Approach to Patch

1. **Identify Where Type Hints are Processed**: The first step would be to locate where in the Sphinx autodoc extension the type hints are processed for functions and methods. This likely involves parsing and formatting function signatures.

2. **Handling Overloaded Functions**: Once the relevant section is identified, the next step is to ensure that overloaded functions are detected and handled appropriately. Python's `typing` module and the `functools` module's `@singledispatch` decorator could provide insights into how to manage multiple signatures for a single function.

3. **Respecting `autodoc_typehints` Setting**: The core of the issue is ensuring that the handling of overloaded functions respects the `autodoc_typehints` setting. This might involve modifying the logic that applies this setting to check if a function is overloaded and, if so, apply the setting to each overloaded signature.

### Hypothetical Code Snippet

Since I cannot provide an exact match for the original program, here's a hypothetical snippet illustrating how one might begin to approach the issue:

```python
# This is a hypothetical snippet and may not directly correspond to Sphinx's codebase

def process_function_documentation(function_obj, autodoc_typehints):
    # Check if the function is overloaded
    if hasattr(function_obj, '__overloads__'):
        # Process each overload, respecting the autodoc_typehints setting
        for overload in function_obj.__overloads__:
            process_single_function(overload, autodoc_typehints)
    else:
        # Process a non-overloaded function
        process_single_function(function_obj, autodoc_typehints)

def process_single_function(function_obj, autodoc_typehints):
    # Actual processing of a single function's documentation, respecting autodoc_typehints
    pass
```

This conceptual approach and hypothetical snippet are intended to provide a starting point for addressing the issue. Actual implementation would require a thorough understanding of Sphinx's autodoc extension's codebase, as well as testing to ensure that the changes correctly address the issue without introducing regressions.

For a precise solution, I recommend consulting the Sphinx documentation, exploring the source code, and possibly reaching out to the Sphinx community for support.
