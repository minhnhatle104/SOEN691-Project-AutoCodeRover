Given the constraints and limitations in the provided context, and without specific code snippets or access to the actual buggy locations in the codebase, it's not feasible to create a direct and applicable patch. The issue described involves complex Django model and migration mechanics, which are highly dependent on the specific structure of the models and the state of the migrations in the project.

However, the general approach to solving the described issue involves a two-step migration process to first remove the `unique_together` constraint and then change the field from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField`. Since I cannot provide a direct patch without the actual code, I recommend the following steps to manually address the issue:

### Step 1: Remove the `unique_together` Constraint

1. Update the `Authors` model by removing the `unique_together` constraint from the `Meta` class.
2. Generate a new migration for this change using `python manage.py makemigrations`.

### Step 2: Change `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`

1. After applying the migration from Step 1, update the `Authors` model again, this time changing the `project_data_set` field from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField`.
2. Generate another migration for this change using `python manage.py makemigrations`.
3. Apply the migration using `python manage.py migrate`.

### Manual Intervention in Migrations

If the automatic migration generation does not resolve the issue or if you encounter errors during migration, you may need to manually edit the migration files. This involves:

- Carefully editing the generated migration files to ensure they accurately represent the changes to the models.
- Possibly splitting or combining operations in migration files to ensure a smooth transition of the database schema.

### Debugging Migration Issues

- Use `python manage.py showmigrations` to review the current state of migrations and ensure that all migrations have been applied correctly.
- If you encounter errors, use the detailed error messages to guide the debugging process. The error message `Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)` suggests that Django's migration system is expecting a constraint that no longer exists or has been improperly modified.

### Conclusion

Without the ability to directly modify the program based on the provided context, these steps offer a conceptual approach to resolving the migration issue described. It's important to proceed cautiously, especially when manually editing migration files, to avoid disrupting the database schema and migration history.
