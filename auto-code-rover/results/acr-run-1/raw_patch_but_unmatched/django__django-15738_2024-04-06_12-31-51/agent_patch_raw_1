Given the context and the limitations in the provided information, it's challenging to write a precise patch for the issue without access to the specific models and migrations that are causing the problem. However, based on the general description of the issue, I can provide a conceptual approach to resolving the problem described in the issue: migrating a `ForeignKey` field to a `ManyToManyField` and dealing with the `unique_together` constraint.

Since the detailed code causing the issue wasn't provided, and the search results did not return the specific locations of the models or the erroneous migration files, the following is a hypothetical patch based on common practices in Django migrations and model changes.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

When you need to change a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField` in Django and address `unique_together` constraints, you typically need to:

1. Remove the `unique_together` constraint from the model's Meta class.
2. Change the field from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.
3. Create new migrations to reflect these changes.

However, as the issue describes a problem with applying migrations, a step-by-step approach with intermediate migrations might be necessary.

#### Modification 1: Remove `unique_together` constraint

First, modify the model to remove the `unique_together` constraint.

```python
<file>app/models.py</file>
<original>
class Authors(models.Model):
    ...
    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)
</original>
<patched>
class Authors(models.Model):
    ...
    class Meta:
        pass
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Change `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`

After successfully migrating the removal of `unique_together`, change the field type and create another migration.

```python
<file>app/models.py</file>
<original>
project_data_set = models.ForeignKey(
    ProjectDataSet,
    on_delete=models.PROTECT
)
</original>
<patched>
project_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(
    ProjectDataSet,
)
</patched>
```

### Applying the Changes

1. After making each change, run `python manage.py makemigrations` to generate migration files for each step.
2. Apply the migrations using `python manage.py migrate`.

### Note

This approach assumes the existence of `app/models.py` as a placeholder for where the models might be located. You will need to replace this with the actual path to your models file. Additionally, since the specific error and migration files were not provided, this solution outlines a general approach rather than a direct patch to existing migration files.

If the issue persists after these steps, reviewing the generated migration files for errors or missing operations related to the field change and constraint removal would be necessary. In complex cases, manually editing the migration files or creating custom migration operations might be required.
