Given the constraints and the information provided, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the approach to patch the issue, especially since the original and patched sections did not directly match any existing code snippets provided. The issue seems to stem from the formatting of the help text in a Django management command, but without direct access to the specific implementation of the `Command` class that is causing the issue, providing a precise patch is challenging.

However, based on the general understanding of how Django processes the `help` text attribute in management commands, here's a more conceptual approach to what a patch could look like, focusing on ensuring proper handling of multiline strings in Python, which might not have been directly applicable:

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>path/to/your/custom_command.py</file>
<original>Not directly applicable as the specific implementation details of the Command class were not provided.</original>
<patched>Ensure that the help text in the custom management command is correctly formatted as a multiline string using triple quotes. Additionally, verify that no custom processing or overriding methods (such as a custom print_help method in the Command class) interfere with the standard display of help text in Django's management command framework.</patched>
```

This conceptual modification suggests ensuring that the `help` text is properly formatted using triple quotes for multiline strings and checking for any custom logic that might interfere with how Django displays this help text. 

Without specific code snippets from the `Command` class that's causing the issue, it's difficult to provide a more precise patch. The recommendation is to review the custom command's implementation for any deviations from Django's standard practices for defining the `help` text and to ensure that any custom processing of the help text adheres to Python's string formatting rules.
