        "content": "Based on the information provided from the search result, the `BaseCommand` class is located in `django/core/management/base.py`. This class is a fundamental part of Django's command-line utility framework, providing a structure for creating and executing management commands. The issue at hand involves the formatting of help text for a custom management command, which is likely to involve the `help` attribute and possibly the `print_help` method of the `BaseCommand` class.\n\nThe `help` attribute is a string that provides a description of what the command does and can include usage examples. The issue describes a problem where the formatting of the help text does not meet expectations when the command's help is displayed. Specifically, the newline character or paragraph separation between \"Import a contract from tzkt\" and \"Example usage:\" is not being respected in the output.\n\nGiven this context, the problem might be related to how the help text is processed and displayed. The `print_help` method, which is responsible for printing the command's help text, could be a key area to investigate. It's possible that during the processing of the help text, newline characters or paragraph breaks are not being handled as expected.\n\nTo address this issue, potential solutions could involve:\n1. **Adjusting the `help` attribute's formatting**: Ensuring that the help text is correctly formatted within the command class definition. This might involve using triple-quoted strings (`\"\"\"`) to preserve multiline text formatting.\n2. **Modifying the `print_help` method**: If the issue is with how help text is being displayed, overriding or extending the `print_help` method in the custom command class to better handle multiline or paragraph-separated text might be necessary.\n\nBefore proceeding with a patch, it would be beneficial to review how the `help` attribute is currently set in the custom command class (`Command`) and how the `print_help` method processes and outputs this text. This would provide a clearer understanding of where the formatting issue originates and how best to address it."

However, the issue might also be related to how the `help` attribute's content is formatted or processed elsewhere in the `BaseCommand` class or in the custom command class (`Command`). Without more context on how the `Command` class is implemented, especially how it sets and uses the `help` attribute, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact location of the bug."
