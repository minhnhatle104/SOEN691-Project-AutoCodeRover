Given the constraints and the nature of the issue without direct access to the actual source code or the ability to directly match the original program's code snippets, it's clear that a precise patch cannot be provided in this format. However, the guidance and conceptual approach described previously should serve as a solid foundation for addressing the issue within your project's specific context.

To reiterate the essence of the solution:

1. **Ensure Custom Database Router Respects the `using` Hint**: Modify the `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, and possibly `allow_migrate` methods in your custom `TenantDatabaseRouter` to check for and respect the `using` hint provided by Django. This hint indicates the database alias that should be used for the operation, which is crucial for ensuring that migrations and other database operations respect the `--database` parameter.

2. **Review Custom Middleware for Potential Interference**: While the middleware might not be directly causing the issue with migrations, it's essential to ensure that any context or state it sets up (such as tenant information) does not inadvertently interfere with database routing logic, especially during migrations.

Since a direct patch cannot be applied without matching the original program's code, I recommend taking the conceptual guidance provided and carefully applying it to your project's custom classes. This will likely involve reviewing and modifying the source code of the `TenantDatabaseRouter` and `TenantSubdomainMiddleware` directly within your project.

Testing is crucial after making these changes to ensure that the issue is resolved and that no new issues are introduced. Consider writing unit tests that specifically test the behavior of the database routing and middleware logic during migrations with the `--database` parameter specified. This can help ensure that your modifications achieve the desired effect and maintain the integrity of your application's multi-tenant architecture.
