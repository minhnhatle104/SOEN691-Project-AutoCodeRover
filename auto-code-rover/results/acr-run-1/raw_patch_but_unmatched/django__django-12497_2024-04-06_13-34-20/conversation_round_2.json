And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find where the incorrect hint is being generated in the Django codebase. The issue mentions a problem with the hint provided when there are more than 2 `ForeignKeys` in an intermediary model of a `m2m` field and no `through_fields` have been set. The incorrect hint suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical` and `through` arguments, which are actually arguments for `ManyToManyField`.\n\nGiven this information, we should look for the part of the Django codebase that generates this specific hint. Since the issue is related to model fields and specifically mentions `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField`, we can start by searching for methods or code snippets that might be responsible for validating `m2m` fields or generating hints for them.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"validate_through_fields\")`: This method name is a guess based on the description of the issue. It's possible that a method with this name or similar exists for validating `through_fields` in `m2m` relationships.\n\n2. `search_code(\"use ForeignKey\")`: Since the incorrect hint includes the phrase \"use ForeignKey\", searching for this phrase might lead us directly to the location in the code where the hint is generated.\n\n3. `search_code(\"symmetrical=False, through=\")`: This search is aimed at finding the exact location where the incorrect hint is being constructed, as the issue mentions these specific arguments being incorrectly suggested for `ForeignKey`."

The method in question is `_check_relationship_model`, found in the file `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. The incorrect hint is generated twice in this method, as indicated by the identical search results for both search queries.\n\nThe hint in question suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\"` for creating a recursive relationship, which is incorrect for several reasons highlighted in the issue description:\n1. The `symmetrical` and `through` are arguments for `ManyToManyField`, not `ForeignKey`.\n2. The `symmetrical=False` is an outdated requirement for recursive relationships with an intermediary model to self, not required since Django 3.0.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps involve preparing a patch to correct this hint. The correction should involve:\n- Replacing `ForeignKey` with `ManyToManyField` in the hint.\n- Removing or updating the mention of `symmetrical=False` to reflect current Django requirements for recursive relationships with an intermediary model.\n\nThe specific code snippet that needs to be corrected is:\n\n```python\nhint=(\n    'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n    'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\n) % (\n    RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,\n```\n\nThis snippet is located in the `_check_relationship_model` function of the `ManyToManyField` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`."
