I apologize for the confusion earlier. Given the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding in matching the exact original code snippet from the provided context. Let's correct this with a precise match based on the provided code snippet and apply the necessary patch accurately.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/related.py</file>
<original>
hint=(
    'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
    'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'
) % (
    RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
    relationship_model_name,
)
</original>
<patched>
hint=(
    'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
    'use ManyToManyField("%s", through="%s").'
) % (
    RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
    relationship_model_name,
)
</patched>
```

Given the limitations in the interaction, I aimed to correct the hint by replacing the incorrect guidance regarding `ForeignKey` with the correct `ManyToManyField` usage, and I removed the `symmetrical=False` part, as it's not applicable to `ManyToManyField`. This patch reflects the necessary changes based on the issue description and the provided code context.
