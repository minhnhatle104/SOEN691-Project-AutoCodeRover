Note: The modifications are identical because the issue description and search results indicated that the same incorrect hint appears twice in the `_check_relationship_model` method. The patch corrects the hint by replacing `ForeignKey` with `ManyToManyField` and removing the `symmetrical=False` argument, which is not applicable to `ManyToManyField` and is no longer a requirement for recursive relationships with an intermediary model since Django 3.0.
