Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without specific details from the actual implementation of `BlockDiagMatrix` and its interaction with the `as_explicit` method. The provided context and error description suggest a problem with handling single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` instances, but without direct access to the source code where the issue occurs, proposing a precise patch is challenging.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Implementation**: Directly examining the source code of `BlockDiagMatrix`, especially how it inherits from or interacts with `BlockMatrix` and `MatrixExpr`, to understand the mechanism of conversion to a dense matrix (`as_explicit` method).

2. **Identifying the Exact Issue**: Pinpointing where in the code the `TypeError: 'One' object is not subscriptable` occurs, which likely involves how elements are accessed during the conversion process.

3. **Developing a Test Case**: Creating a test case that reproduces the issue with a single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` would be crucial for verifying any potential fix.

4. **Implementing a Fix**: With a clear understanding of the issue, a fix would involve ensuring that single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` instances are handled correctly during the conversion process, possibly by adjusting how the `as_explicit` method or related functionality processes such instances.

Without the ability to directly apply a patch or access the specific code segments where the issue occurs, the most practical advice is to follow the steps outlined above to diagnose and resolve the issue within the Sympy codebase.
