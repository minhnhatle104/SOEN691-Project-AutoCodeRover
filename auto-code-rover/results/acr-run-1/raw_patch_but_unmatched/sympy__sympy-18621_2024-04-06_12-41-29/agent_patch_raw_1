Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem arises from the handling of a single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` when converting it to a regular `Matrix` using the `as_explicit` method. The traceback indicates a failure related to subscriptability, which suggests that the conversion process does not properly handle cases where the `BlockDiagMatrix` contains only one block.

Without direct access to the exact implementation details of the `BlockDiagMatrix` and how it interacts with the `as_explicit` method, I will propose a conceptual patch based on the information available. This patch aims to ensure that a `BlockDiagMatrix` with a single element is correctly converted into a `Matrix` by properly handling the single-element case within the `as_explicit` method or the relevant conversion mechanism.

Since the specific implementation details and the exact location of the bug are not provided, the following patch is hypothetical and aims to illustrate a possible approach to resolving the issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet where the conversion is handled
def as_explicit(self):
    # This is a simplified representation and may not match the actual code
    return ImmutableDenseMatrix([[self[i, j] for j in range(self.cols)] for i in range(self.rows)])
</original>
<patched>
from sympy.matrices.immutable import ImmutableDenseMatrix

def as_explicit(self):
    # Check if the BlockDiagMatrix contains only one block and handle it appropriately
    if len(self.blocks) == 1:
        # Directly return the single block as an ImmutableDenseMatrix if it's the only one
        single_block = self.blocks[0, 0]
        return ImmutableDenseMatrix(single_block)
    else:
        # Handle the general case with multiple blocks
        return ImmutableDenseMatrix([[self[i, j] for j in range(self.cols)] for i in range(self.rows)])
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that `BlockDiagMatrix` has an attribute `blocks` that stores the matrix blocks and that the conversion to a dense matrix incorrectly handles the case of a single block. The patched version adds a check for this condition and directly converts the single block to an `ImmutableDenseMatrix` if applicable. 

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might require adjustments to fit the actual codebase structure and logic of Sympy. Further testing would be necessary to ensure that this change resolves the issue without introducing new ones.
