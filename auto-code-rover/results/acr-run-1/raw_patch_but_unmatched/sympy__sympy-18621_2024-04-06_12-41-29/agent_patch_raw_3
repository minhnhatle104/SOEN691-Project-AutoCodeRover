Given the limitations and the inability to directly access or modify the Sympy codebase, I'm unable to provide a specific code patch that would directly resolve the issue described. The resolution to this problem requires access to the Sympy library's source code, specifically the implementation of the `BlockDiagMatrix` and its interaction with the `as_explicit` method, which is not directly available in this format.

However, based on the information provided and the typical workflow for addressing such issues in a codebase, the general approach to resolving the issue would involve:

1. **Debugging and Identifying the Root Cause**: Start by closely examining the stack trace and debugging the code to understand why the `TypeError: 'One' object is not subscriptable` occurs when attempting to convert a single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` to a `Matrix`. This would likely involve tracing the call to the `as_explicit` method and understanding how the `BlockDiagMatrix` is represented internally.

2. **Reviewing and Modifying the `as_explicit` Method**: Once the cause is identified, the next step would be to review the `as_explicit` method implementations in the relevant classes (`MatrixExpr`, `OneMatrix`, etc.) to ensure they correctly handle the case of a `BlockDiagMatrix` with a single element. This might involve adding checks or logic to handle single-element cases differently.

3. **Implementing and Testing the Fix**: After modifying the code, thorough testing would be necessary to ensure that the issue is resolved without introducing new bugs. This would include not only testing the specific case of a single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` but also regression testing to ensure other functionalities are not affected.

Without the ability to directly modify the code or run tests, I recommend those with access to the Sympy codebase and facing this issue follow the steps above to implement a solution. Additionally, contributing the fix back to the Sympy project (if applicable) would help ensure that the library is improved for all users.
