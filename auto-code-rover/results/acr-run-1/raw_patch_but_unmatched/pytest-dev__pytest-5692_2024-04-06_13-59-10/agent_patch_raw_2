Given the constraints and the inability to directly access or modify the actual `src/_pytest/junitxml.py` file within the pytest framework, I'll provide a conceptual patch based on common Python practices and the information provided. This hypothetical patch is meant to illustrate how one might approach adding `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes to the `<testsuite>` element in JUnit XML reports generated by pytest. Please adapt this conceptual approach to the specific implementation details of your project.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/junitxml.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming the original code directly creates the testsuite element without hostname and timestamp
testsuite = etree.Element("testsuite", name="pytest", errors="0", failures="0", skipped="0", tests="0", time="0")
</original>
<patched>
import socket
from datetime import datetime

# Added imports for socket and datetime to retrieve hostname and current timestamp
hostname = socket.gethostname()
timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()

# Modified the testsuite element creation to include hostname and timestamp attributes
testsuite = etree.Element("testsuite", name="pytest", errors="0", failures="0", skipped="0", tests="0", time="0", hostname=hostname, timestamp=timestamp)
</patched>
```

This modification is a conceptual illustration meant to guide the process of adding `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes to the `<testsuite>` element in the generated JUnit XML reports. The actual code in `src/_pytest/junitxml.py` may differ significantly in structure and implementation details. 

When adapting this approach to your project, ensure to:
- Verify the actual structure and implementation logic within the `src/_pytest/junitxml.py` file.
- Adjust the patch to fit the actual code patterns and practices used in the project.
- Test the changes thoroughly to ensure that the added `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes appear correctly in the generated JUnit XML reports and do not interfere with other functionalities.

This approach assumes familiarity with Python's standard libraries for network and time (`socket` and `datetime`) and basic XML manipulation in Python.
