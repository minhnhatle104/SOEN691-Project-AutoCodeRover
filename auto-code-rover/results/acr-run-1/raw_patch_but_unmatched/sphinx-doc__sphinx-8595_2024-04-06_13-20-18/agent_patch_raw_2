Given the constraints and the information provided, I'll offer a hypothetical patch based on standard practices for modifying Python modules to respect an empty `__all__` attribute. This example assumes a typical structure for handling module documentation in Sphinx's `autodoc` extension but may not directly correspond to the actual Sphinx codebase due to the lack of direct access to the source files.

Since the specific implementation details and the exact location of the relevant code in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` are not provided, the following patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue described:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original code snippet, as the exact code was not provided.
# It represents a common pattern where the __all__ attribute might be checked
# to decide which members to document.
for membername in dir(module):
    if hasattr(module, '__all__') and membername not in module.__all__:
        continue
    # Documentation generation logic continues here...
</original>
<patched>
# This patched version adds an explicit check for an empty __all__ list
# and skips the documentation generation for members if __all__ is empty.
if hasattr(module, '__all__'):
    if not module.__all__:  # Check if __all__ is an empty list
        # Skip documenting any members if __all__ is explicitly empty
        continue
    elif membername not in module.__all__:
        continue
# Documentation generation logic continues here...
</patched>
```

Please note, this patch is provided as an illustrative example based on common patterns in handling the `__all__` attribute in Python documentation tools. The actual Sphinx codebase may have different structures or require additional considerations. This patch should be adapted to fit the specific implementation details of Sphinx's `autodoc` extension. Testing and validation within the Sphinx development environment are crucial to ensure that the patch correctly addresses the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
