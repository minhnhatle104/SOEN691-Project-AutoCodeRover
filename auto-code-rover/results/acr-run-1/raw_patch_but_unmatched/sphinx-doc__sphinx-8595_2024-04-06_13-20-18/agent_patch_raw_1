Given the issue with Sphinx's autodoc extension ignoring an empty `__all__` attribute, a patch needs to ensure that when `__all__` is explicitly set to an empty list, no module members are documented. Although I don't have access to the actual source code of Sphinx or the ability to test changes in real-time, I can propose a conceptual patch based on common practices in handling such scenarios in Python documentation tools.

The patch would involve modifying the logic in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` that determines which members to document based on the presence and content of the `__all__` attribute in a module. Specifically, the code should check if `__all__` is defined and, if so, whether it is an empty list. If `__all__` is empty, the autodoc process should skip documenting any members from that module.

Here's a conceptual patch based on this description:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
if hasattr(module, '__all__'):
    membernames = module.__all__
</original>
<patched>
if hasattr(module, '__all__'):
    # Check if __all__ is explicitly set to an empty list
    if not module.__all__:
        membernames = []
    else:
        membernames = module.__all__
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that if `__all__` is defined and is an empty list, `membernames` is explicitly set to an empty list as well, preventing any members from being documented. This change respects the intention of an empty `__all__` attribute, aligning the behavior with the user's expectations.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and based on the description of the issue and the structure of typical Python documentation tools. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific architecture and codebase of Sphinx. Before applying this patch, it should be reviewed and tested within the Sphinx development environment to ensure it correctly addresses the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
