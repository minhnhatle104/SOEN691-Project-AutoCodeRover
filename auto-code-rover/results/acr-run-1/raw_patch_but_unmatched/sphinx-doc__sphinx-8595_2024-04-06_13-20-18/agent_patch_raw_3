Given the constraints and the nature of the task, it's clear that creating a precise patch without direct access to the specific implementation details of the Sphinx project's `autodoc` extension is challenging. My previous attempts to provide a hypothetical patch were based on common patterns and practices in handling Python documentation, but without the exact code structure, it's difficult to offer a direct and applicable solution.

In real-world scenarios, resolving such an issue would involve:

1. **Reviewing the actual source code** in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to understand how the `__all__` attribute is currently processed.
2. **Identifying the logic** that iterates over module members to decide which ones to include in the documentation, especially in relation to the `__all__` attribute.
3. **Implementing a condition** that checks if `__all__` is explicitly set to an empty list and, if so, ensuring no members are documented.

Since I cannot provide a patch that directly matches the original program without seeing the specific code, I recommend the following steps for someone addressing this issue in the Sphinx project:

- **Locate the member filtering logic** within the `autodoc` extension, likely in a method responsible for collecting module members to document.
- **Modify this logic** to explicitly check for an empty `__all__` list. If `__all__` is empty, the method should return early or skip the member collection process, adhering to the expected behavior.
- **Add unit tests** to verify that modules with an empty `__all__` list do not have any members documented, ensuring the patch resolves the issue without introducing regressions.

This approach aligns with standard practices for debugging and patching issues in software projects. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific codebase, testing changes thoroughly, and considering the impact of modifications on the overall functionality.
