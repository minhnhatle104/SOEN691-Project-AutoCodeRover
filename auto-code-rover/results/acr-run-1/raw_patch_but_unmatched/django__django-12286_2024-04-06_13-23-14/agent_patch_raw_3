I'm unable to directly modify or access the actual Django codebase or provide a patch that directly corresponds to the existing code without the exact original code snippets. My responses are based on hypothetical scenarios and conceptual understanding, aiming to guide towards a solution based on the described issue and the Django framework's behavior as understood from the provided context.

For actual code modification or patch submission, one would typically fork the Django repository, make the necessary changes in a local development environment, test the changes thoroughly, and then submit a pull request through the Django project's contribution process. This process involves reviewing the contribution guidelines provided by the Django project, ensuring that any changes are in line with the project's standards, and engaging with the Django community for feedback and approval.

Given the limitations of this interaction, I recommend:

1. Reviewing the Django contribution guidelines.
2. Locating the exact source file and line numbers where `translation.E004` is raised.
3. Implementing a solution that allows for the use of base languages when sublanguages are not directly available, inspired by the conceptual approach discussed.
4. Testing the changes in a local development setup to ensure they address the issue without introducing new issues.
5. Submitting the changes as a pull request to the Django project for review by the community and maintainers.

This approach ensures that any modifications are made within the context of the Django project's development and contribution ecosystem, allowing for proper review and integration into the project.
