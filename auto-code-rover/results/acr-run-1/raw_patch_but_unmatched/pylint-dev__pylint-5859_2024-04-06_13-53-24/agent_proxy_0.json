Given the nature of the issue, it's likely related to how pylint parses comments and recognizes note tags, especially those consisting entirely of punctuation. \n\nLet's start by searching for relevant parts of the pylint codebase that handle the `--notes` option and the detection of fixme warnings:\n\n1. Search for the method or function that processes the `--notes` option. This could be in the configuration setup or command-line argument parsing.\n2. Search for the method or function that identifies and reports fixme warnings (W0511), as this is where the bug likely manifests.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n- `search_method(\"process_notes_option\")`: This is a hypothetical method name that might be responsible for processing the `--notes` option.\n- `search_method(\"report_fixme_warnings\")`: This is another hypothetical method name that might be responsible for identifying and reporting fixme warnings based on note tags.\n\nLet's proceed with these searches to gather more context."
