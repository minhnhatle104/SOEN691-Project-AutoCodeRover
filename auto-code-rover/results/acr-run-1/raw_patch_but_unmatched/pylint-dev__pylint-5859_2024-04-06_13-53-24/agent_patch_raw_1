Given the nature of the issue with pylint's `--notes` option and the lack of direct access to the specific parts of the codebase where the issue resides, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common patterns in handling such issues in Python. This patch will focus on enhancing the logic to ensure that note tags consisting entirely of punctuation are not ignored.

Since the exact location and code snippet related to the issue were not identified through the search API calls, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue. It's based on the assumption that the problem might lie in the way note tags are parsed and matched.

# modification 1
```python
<file>pylint/checkers/misc.py</file>
<original>
tags = self.config.notes
if isinstance(tags, str):
    tags = tags.split(",")
tags = [tag.strip() for tag in tags]
</original>
<patched>
tags = self.config.notes
if isinstance(tags, str):
    tags = tags.split(",")
# Ensure that tags consisting entirely of punctuation are also included
tags = [tag.strip() for tag in tags if tag.strip()]
# Add a preprocessing step to escape punctuation for regex matching
import re
tags = [re.escape(tag) for tag in tags]
</patched>
```

This modification hypothesizes that the issue might be related to the preprocessing of note tags before they are used for matching within comments. The original code snippet is assumed to split the `--notes` option into individual tags and strip whitespace. The patched version adds two key changes:
1. It ensures that empty strings are not included in the tags list after stripping whitespace, which might inadvertently remove valid punctuation-only tags.
2. It escapes punctuation in the tags, making them suitable for regex matching. This is important because unescaped punctuation might be interpreted as regex special characters, leading to unexpected matching behavior.

Please note, this patch is speculative and serves as an example of how one might approach fixing the described issue based on common Python and pylint patterns. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific logic and structure of the pylint codebase.
