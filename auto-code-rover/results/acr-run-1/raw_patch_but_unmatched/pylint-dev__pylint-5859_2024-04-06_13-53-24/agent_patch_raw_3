Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, it appears I've reached the limit of how I can assist with generating a specific patch without direct access to the relevant sections of the pylint codebase or the ability to execute precise search API calls to locate the exact code snippets.

Creating an accurate patch requires detailed knowledge of the current implementation, including how the `--notes` option is parsed and how note tags are matched within the code. Without this information or the ability to directly query the codebase, I'm unable to provide a patch that matches the original program accurately.

To address the issue described, I recommend the following steps, which would typically be undertaken by a developer with access to the pylint codebase:

1. **Review the Command-Line Parsing Logic**: Locate where pylint parses the `--notes` option. This might be in a configuration or command-line argument parsing module. Ensure that punctuation-only tags are correctly captured and not filtered out or altered during parsing.

2. **Examine the Note Tag Matching Logic**: Identify the code responsible for matching note tags within comments. This could involve regular expressions or other string matching techniques. Ensure that the logic correctly handles tags that consist entirely of punctuation, possibly by adjusting regex patterns to include punctuation characters.

3. **Add Tests**: Once the relevant sections are identified and modified, add unit tests to cover cases with punctuation-only tags. This ensures that the issue is resolved and prevents regressions in the future.

4. **Consult Documentation or Contributors**: If the issue persists or if locating the relevant code proves difficult, consulting the pylint documentation or reaching out to the pylint developer community for guidance could provide additional insights.

I hope these steps provide a clear path forward for addressing the issue within the pylint project. If you have further questions or need assistance with different aspects of your project, please feel free to ask.
