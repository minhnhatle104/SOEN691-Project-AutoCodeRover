        "content": "Based on the search results, let's analyze the context and information we've gathered to address the issue described in the submitted ticket.\n\n1. **`sqlmigrate` Method Search Result**:\n   - The search for a method named `sqlmigrate` in the codebase returned no results. This could mean that `sqlmigrate` might not be a method by itself but part of a larger command or functionality within the Django migrations framework. It's also possible that it's referred to differently within the codebase, or it's a command-line utility rather than a method within a class.\n\n2. **`MigrationExecutor` Class**:\n   - We found the `MigrationExecutor` class within `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. This class is crucial for handling the execution of migrations, including applying and unapplying migrations, recording migrations, and generating migration plans. However, the provided code snippet does not directly reference handling transactional DDL or the `BEGIN/COMMIT` wrapping mentioned in the issue. To address the issue, we might need to look into methods that interact with the database schema directly or those that generate the SQL for migrations, such as `collect_sql`, `apply_migration`, or potentially other methods not listed in the snippet.\n\n3. **Usage of `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`**:\n   - The search for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` yielded 8 snippets across various files, including `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`, `django/core/management/commands/createcachetable.py`, `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`, and `tests/migrations/test_operations.py`. This indicates that the capability to rollback DDL is considered in multiple places within Django's codebase, affecting how migrations and schema operations are handled. Specifically, the presence in `schema.py` suggests that this feature flag might influence how schema alterations are executed and whether they are wrapped in transactions.\n\n4. **Search in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`**:\n   - The attempt to find specific test structures within `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` did not return any results. This could be due to an incorrect file path or an issue with the search query. However, knowing that there are references to `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in this file suggests that there are indeed tests that consider the transactional capabilities of the database when testing migrations.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n- Investigating how the `MigrationExecutor` and possibly other related classes or utilities (like a command that represents `sqlmigrate`) determine when to wrap migration SQL in `BEGIN/COMMIT` based on the atomicity of the migration and the database's support for transactional DDL.\n- Reviewing the implementation in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` and other files where `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is used to understand how this feature influences schema operations.\n- Correcting the approach to finding relevant tests in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` and potentially adjusting or adding tests to cover the scenario described in the issue.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for developing a patch that ensures `sqlmigrate` output is correctly wrapped in transactions based on both the migration's atomicity and the database's support for transactional DDL."

To better understand how `sqlmigrate` functionality is implemented or represented within the Django framework, it might be beneficial to search for it as a command rather than a method, or look for methods related to generating or executing migration SQL. Since the initial search for `sqlmigrate` as a method returned no results, we should consider looking for files or classes related to Django's command-line utilities or migration commands.\n     - `search_code(\"sqlmigrate\")`\n  2. Given the importance of the `MigrationExecutor` class and its potential role in the issue, further exploration of its methods, specifically those that might deal with generating or executing SQL for migrations, could provide valuable insights. It would be useful to examine the `collect_sql` method more closely, as it might be involved in generating the SQL output for migrations.\n     - `search_method_in_class(method_name: \"collect_sql\", class_name: \"MigrationExecutor\")`\n  3. To address the gap in understanding the testing structure, specifically tests that might cover the transactional behavior of migrations, a refined search in the `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` file could help.

        "content": "With the new search results, we have gathered more context that can help us address the issue more effectively. Let's analyze the information:\n\n1. **`sqlmigrate` References**:\n   - The search for `sqlmigrate` has revealed several important files where it is mentioned:\n     - `django/core/management/__init__.py` and `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` are particularly significant as they directly relate to the management command `sqlmigrate`. The presence in `commands/sqlmigrate.py` confirms that `sqlmigrate` is indeed implemented as a Django management command, which aligns with the initial assumption that it was not merely a method but part of Django's command-line interface for migrations.\n     - The numerous matches in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` and `tests/bash_completion/tests.py` indicate that `sqlmigrate` is well-covered by tests and its functionality is considered in the context of bash completion, which is relevant for understanding how the command is expected to behave and be used.\n\n2. **`MigrationExecutor.collect_sql` Method**:\n   - The `collect_sql` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class is responsible for taking a migration plan and returning a list of SQL statements that represent the plan. The method uses the `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True`, which is crucial for generating the SQL without actually executing it. This method is likely where the decision to wrap or not wrap the output in `BEGIN/COMMIT` based on the database's support for transactional DDL should be integrated or adjusted.\n\n3. **Usage of `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in Tests**:\n   - The search within `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` found two snippets where `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is used in tests related to `sqlmigrate`. Both snippets are part of assertions that check whether transaction start and end markers are found in the output of `sqlmigrate`, conditional on the database's ability to rollback DDL. This directly relates to the issue at hand, as it tests the behavior that needs to be corrected or extended based on the issue description.\n\n**Analysis Conclusion**:\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n  - The primary location for addressing the issue is likely within `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`. This file should contain the logic for the `sqlmigrate` command, including how it generates and formats its SQL output. Adjustments here would directly affect how `BEGIN/COMMIT` wrappers are applied based on `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n  - The `MigrationExecutor.collect_sql` method in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` is another critical area. Since this method is responsible for collecting SQL statements for migrations, ensuring that it correctly respects the database's support for transactional DDL when generating these statements is essential.\n  - The tests in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` that use `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` are important for validating that the issue is resolved. New tests or adjustments to existing tests will be necessary to ensure that the corrected behavior is accurately captured.\n\nGiven this analysis, we have a clear understanding of where the issue needs to be addressed and where to implement tests to ensure the fix is effective. The next step would be to draft changes to `sqlmigrate.py` to adjust how SQL output is generated based on the database's capabilities and to update or add tests in `test_commands.py` to cover these changes."

This patch assumes the structure of Django's codebase and typical patterns in its implementation. Note that actual file paths and code might differ in the real Django project.\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py</file>\n<original>\nwith self.connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True, atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:\n</original>\n<patched>\nwith self.connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True, atomic=migration.atomic and self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl) as schema_editor:\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that when the `sqlmigrate` command collects SQL statements using the schema editor, it considers not only whether the migration is marked as atomic but also if the database connection's features support rolling back DDL statements. This change is made in the hypothetical location of the `sqlmigrate` command implementation, specifically where it invokes the schema editor for collecting SQL statements.\n\n# modification 2\n```python\n<file>django/db/migrations/executor.py</file>\n<original>\ndef collect_sql(self, plan):\n    ...\n    for migration, backwards in plan:\n        with self.connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True, atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:\n</original>\n<patched>\ndef collect_sql(self, plan):\n    ...\n    for migration, backwards in plan:\n        with self.connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True, atomic=migration.atomic and self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl) as schema_editor:\n</patched>\n```\n\nIn this modification, the `collect_sql` method of the `MigrationExecutor` class is updated to ensure that the `atomic` parameter passed to the schema editor is conditioned not only on the migration's atomic attribute but also on the database's capability to rollback DDL, as indicated by `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\nPlease note, these patches are based on the provided context and a hypothetical understanding of the Django codebase structure. Actual implementation details may vary, and thorough testing should be conducted to ensure the changes address the issue without introducing regressions."

This approach will outline the necessary changes without specific code snippets from the actual Django project, aiming to guide the resolution of the issue regarding `sqlmigrate` output wrapping in `BEGIN/COMMIT`.\n\n### Conceptual Patch Approach\n\n#### Modification to `sqlmigrate` Command Logic\n\n**File Path**: `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n\n**Description**:\nThe `sqlmigrate` command needs to conditionally wrap its SQL output in transaction statements based on the database's support for transactional DDL. This involves adjusting the logic where the SQL for migrations is generated and formatted for output.\n\n**Conceptual Change**:\n- Before generating the SQL output, check the database connection's capability to support transactional DDL using `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n- Conditionally prepend `BEGIN;` and append `COMMIT;` to the SQL output based on the above capability check.\n\n#### Modification to Migration Execution Logic\n\n**File Path**: `django/db/migrations/executor.py`\n\n**Description**:\nThe `MigrationExecutor` may play a role in determining how migrations are executed and, by extension, how their SQL is generated, especially in the context of `collect_sql` method which is used by `sqlmigrate` to generate SQL without executing it.\n\n**Conceptual Change**:\n- In the `collect_sql` method, adjust the invocation of the schema editor to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when deciding on the `atomic` parameter value.\n- This ensures that the collected SQL respects the database's ability to handle transactional DDL, aligning with the adjustments made in the `sqlmigrate` command logic.\n\n#### Test Adjustments\n\n**File Path**: `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n\n**Description**:\nNew tests should be added or existing tests adjusted to verify that the `sqlmigrate` command correctly handles the database's support for transactional DDL.\n\n**Conceptual Change**:\n- Add tests that mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to both `True` and `False` and verify that the SQL output from `sqlmigrate` is correctly wrapped or not wrapped in `BEGIN/COMMIT` accordingly.\n- Ensure that these tests cover various databases that Django supports, reflecting different behaviors regarding transactional DDL.\n\n### Note\nThis conceptual approach outlines the necessary changes without specific original and patched code snippets due to the limitations mentioned. Implementing these changes requires access to the Django codebase, understanding of its structure, and familiarity with its testing framework. After making the proposed changes, thorough testing across supported databases is essential to ensure that the issue is resolved without introducing regressions."
