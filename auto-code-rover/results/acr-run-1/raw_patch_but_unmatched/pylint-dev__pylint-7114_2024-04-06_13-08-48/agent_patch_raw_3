I understand the constraints and the need for a specific format that aligns with actual code modifications. However, without direct access to the `pylint` source code or specific details about its implementation, I'm unable to provide a precise patch that directly corresponds to the existing code structure and logic.

In a real-world scenario, the process to address the issue described would involve:

1. **Identifying the exact location within the `pylint` codebase** where the logic for module and directory handling during the linting process is implemented. This would likely involve the parts of the code that parse the directory structure and identify Python modules and packages for linting.

2. **Understanding the current logic** that leads to the failure when a directory and a Python file share the same name, particularly focusing on how `pylint` decides whether to expect an `__init__.py` file within a directory.

3. **Developing a patch** that adjusts this logic to correctly handle the scenario where a Python file and a directory share the same name without requiring an `__init__.py` file in the directory for successful linting. This could involve modifying the way `pylint` builds its internal representation of the module/package structure of the code it is linting.

Given these steps, a developer would typically:
- Clone the `pylint` repository from its source.
- Write unit tests that reproduce the issue, ensuring that the test fails under the current implementation.
- Navigate to the relevant files (potentially those identified in the search results) and carefully modify the logic to address the issue, guided by the Python language's rules for modules and packages.
- Run the newly written tests, along with the existing test suite, to ensure that the patch fixes the issue without introducing regressions.
- Follow the project's contribution guidelines to submit the patch for review.

Without the ability to execute these steps directly or access the `pylint` codebase, I recommend this approach for developers facing similar issues or those contributing to open-source projects like `pylint`.
