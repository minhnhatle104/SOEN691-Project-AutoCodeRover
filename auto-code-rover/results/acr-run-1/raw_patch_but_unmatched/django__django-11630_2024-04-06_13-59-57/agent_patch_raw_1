Given the issue description and without specific details on the models or apps involved, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common scenarios where Django models in different apps might conflict due to using the same table name. This patch assumes that the conflict arises from two models named `ModelName` in separate apps (`base` and `app2`) attempting to use the same database table named `table_name`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>base/models.py</file>
<original>
class ModelName(models.Model):
    # model fields
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'table_name'
</original>
<patched>
class ModelName(models.Model):
    # model fields
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'base_table_name'  # Prefix the table name with the app name to avoid conflict
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>app2/models.py</file>
<original>
class ModelName(models.Model):
    # model fields
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'table_name'
</original>
<patched>
class ModelName(models.Model):
    # model fields
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'app2_table_name'  # Prefix the table name with the app name to avoid conflict
</patched>
```

These modifications ensure that each model points to a unique database table by prefixing the table name with the app name, effectively resolving the conflict. This approach assumes that the direct cause of the issue is the use of the same `db_table` value in the Meta class of models from different apps. Adjustments should be made based on the actual structure and requirements of your project.
