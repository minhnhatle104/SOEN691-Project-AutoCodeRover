Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, where I cannot directly access or modify files within your project, and based on the generic nature of the issue described, it's challenging to provide a precise patch without specific details about the models or the structure of your Django project.

However, I can offer a conceptual approach to resolving the issue of conflicting table names across different Django apps. This approach involves ensuring that each model within your Django project that points to the same database table either uses a unique table name or is correctly configured to allow for shared table usage without conflicts.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch that matches your program's original code, I recommend the following steps to manually resolve the issue:

1. **Ensure Unique `db_table` Meta Options**:
   - For each model that is intended to use the same table name across different apps, ensure that the `db_table` Meta option is either unique or intentionally set to the same value for shared table usage.

2. **Implement Abstract Models for Shared Structure**:
   - If multiple models across different apps are intended to share the same table structure, consider using an abstract base model that defines the common fields and Meta options. Each app's model can then inherit from this abstract model without directly setting the `db_table` Meta option.

3. **Use Database Routers for Advanced Database Routing**:
   - For complex projects using multiple databases, consider implementing custom database routers that can help manage which models are allowed to interact with which databases. This can prevent unintended table name conflicts across databases.

4. **Review and Test Changes**:
   - After making adjustments, thoroughly review and test your changes to ensure that the issue is resolved. This may involve running your Django project's test suite and performing manual testing as needed.

While I understand this may not provide the direct code modifications you were hoping for, I hope these steps guide you towards resolving the issue within your project's specific context.
