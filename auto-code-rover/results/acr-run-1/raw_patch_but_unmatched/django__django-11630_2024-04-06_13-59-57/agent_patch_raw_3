Given the constraints of our interaction, where direct access to the codebase and specific details about the models or apps involved are not available, and acknowledging the inability to execute or refine search API calls or directly apply patches, a precise code patch cannot be provided. 

However, the issue described suggests a conflict due to models in different Django apps using the same table name. This situation typically requires ensuring unique `db_table` values in the models' Meta classes or implementing database routing logic to handle how models interact with databases.

Since a direct patch cannot be applied without specific details, I recommend the following conceptual approach to address the issue:

1. **Ensure Unique Table Names**:
   - Modify the `db_table` attribute in the Meta class of each conflicting model to ensure it is unique across the entire project.

2. **Abstract Models**:
   - If the models are intended to share the same table due to shared structure or inheritance, consider using an abstract base model to define common fields and methods. Inherit from this abstract model in each app, specifying `db_table` only where necessary to avoid conflicts.

3. **Database Routing**:
   - For projects using multiple databases, ensure that database routing is correctly configured to manage how models from different apps interact with their respective databases.

Without specific file paths, class names, or code snippets, a detailed patch cannot be crafted. Adjustments should be made based on the actual structure and requirements of your Django project, following Django's documentation and best practices for model definition, database configuration, and application architecture.
