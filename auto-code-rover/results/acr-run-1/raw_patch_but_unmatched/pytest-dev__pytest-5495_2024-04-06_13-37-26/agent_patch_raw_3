Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch to the actual source code or further refine the hypothetical patches without access to the specific implementation details of the project's codebase. My previous responses aimed to offer conceptual guidance based on common practices in handling similar issues within Python projects, especially those related to assertion rewriting and the presentation of byte strings in error messages.

To truly resolve the issue described, a developer with access to the project would need to:

1. **Review the Implementation**: Specifically look into `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, focusing on how assertion errors for byte string comparisons are generated and formatted.
2. **Identify the Exact Location**: Pinpoint the method or function where the logic for formatting the comparison failure messages for byte strings is implemented.
3. **Develop a Solution**: Based on the identified logic, modify the code to present byte string differences in a more understandable manner. This could involve adjusting the way byte strings are decoded or represented in the error messages.

Without the ability to directly interact with the project's code and given the limitations of our current setup, I recommend those steps as a guideline for the project's developers to address the issue.
