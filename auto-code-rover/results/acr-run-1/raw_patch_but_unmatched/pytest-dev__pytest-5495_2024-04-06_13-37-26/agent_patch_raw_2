Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the assertion rewriting logic in the project, providing an exact patch is challenging. The hypothetical patches provided were meant to illustrate a general approach to improving the clarity of assertion failure messages for byte string comparisons. 

In real-world scenarios, the development of a patch would involve:

1. Reviewing the actual implementation in the identified files (`src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`).
2. Identifying the exact method or function where the comparison and the generation of the failure message for byte strings occur.
3. Modifying the logic to ensure that byte string differences are presented in a more understandable manner, possibly by improving the decoding strategy or by presenting the differences in a format that is clearer than ASCII ordinal values.

Without the ability to directly view or interact with the project's codebase, I recommend the following steps for developers working on this issue:

- **Directly review the methods in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`** that handle assertion rewriting and diff generation. Look for places where byte strings are specifically handled or where assertion messages are formatted.
- **Consider implementing a strategy for handling byte string comparisons** that includes checking if the operands are byte strings and then applying a more user-friendly format for displaying differences. This could involve converting byte strings to their hexadecimal representation or safely decoding them to UTF-8 for comparison, with fallbacks for non-decodable byte sequences.
- **Ensure compatibility and add tests** to cover cases of byte string comparisons, ensuring that the new or modified logic works as expected and improves the clarity of the assertion failure messages.

Since an exact patch cannot be applied without specific details from the project's codebase, the above steps serve as a guideline for addressing the issue within the context of the project's existing structure and implementation.
