**Explanation**:
- The first modification in `sympy/core/function.py` introduces a check within the `__new__` method of the `Derivative` class to handle `MatrixExpr` objects specifically when evaluating derivatives. If the expression is an instance of `MatrixExpr`, it attempts to call a new method `_eval_derivative_matrixExpr`, which should be defined for matrix expressions to handle their derivatives properly.
- The second modification proposes adding a new method `_eval_derivative_matrixExpr` to the `MatrixExpr` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses that can provide specific implementations for derivatives of matrix expressions. Additionally, it ensures that the `kind` property of `MatrixExpr` returns `MatrixKind`, aligning with the expected behavior described in the issue.
- Note: The actual implementation of `_eval_derivative_matrixExpr` would need to be developed based on the specific rules for differentiating matrix expressions, which is why a placeholder return value of `UndefinedKind()` is used here. This should be replaced with the correct logic for computing derivatives of matrix expressions.
