The issue arises because the `fit_predict` method in `GaussianMixture` (and by inheritance, in `BaseMixture`) selects the best model based on the highest likelihood or lower bound across multiple initializations (`n_init`) and then performs a final E-step to ensure consistency of labels. However, the `predict` method directly uses the model parameters to estimate labels without considering the possibility of multiple initializations leading to different models. To resolve this discrepancy, we need to ensure that both `fit_predict` and `predict` methods use the same model parameters that resulted in the highest likelihood or lower bound.

However, based on the provided code snippets, it appears that the `fit_predict` method already selects the best model parameters (`best_params`) based on the highest lower bound and sets these parameters to the model before predicting labels. This should theoretically ensure that `predict` uses the same model parameters as `fit_predict`. 

Given this, the issue might not be directly in the implementation of these methods but rather in how the model's state is managed between calls to `fit_predict` and subsequent calls to `predict`. Without further evidence of a bug in the provided code snippets and considering the logic seems correct for selecting the best model based on the highest lower bound, it's challenging to propose a specific patch.

One potential area of improvement, not directly related to the bug but more about code clarity and potential future bugs, is to ensure that the model's state is explicitly set to the best found state after all initializations in `fit_predict`. This is already done, but additional comments or a more explicit handling could help prevent future misunderstandings or modifications that could introduce bugs.

Given the information and code provided, without a clear bug in the implementation logic, the best course of action would be to further investigate how the model's state is managed across different calls and ensure that any external factors not visible in the provided snippets are not affecting the consistency between `fit_predict` and `predict`.
