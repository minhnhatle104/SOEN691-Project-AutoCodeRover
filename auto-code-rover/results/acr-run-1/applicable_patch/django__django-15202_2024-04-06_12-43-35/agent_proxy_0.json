            "content": "To understand the context of the issue and find a potential solution, I will need to gather more information about the classes and methods involved in the error. Specifically, I will look into the `URLField` class and the `clean` method within it, as well as the validator that is causing the issue. Additionally, I will investigate the `urlsplit` method mentioned in the traceback to understand how it's being used and why it's throwing a `ValueError`.\n\nHere are the API calls I would like to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"URLField\")` - This will help me understand the implementation of the `URLField` class, which is directly mentioned in the issue.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"URLField\")` - Since the issue occurs when the `clean` method is called, I need to see its implementation to understand how it handles URLs and why it might be throwing a `ValueError`.\n3. `search_method(\"urlsplit\")` - The traceback mentions a failure in the `urlsplit` method. Understanding its implementation and how it's used in the context of URL validation will be crucial.\n4. `search_method(\"__call__\", \"validators\")` - The traceback also points to a `__call__` method in the validators, which seems to be part of the validation process that eventually leads to the error. Understanding this method's role could provide insights into the validation flow and where it might be going wrong."
