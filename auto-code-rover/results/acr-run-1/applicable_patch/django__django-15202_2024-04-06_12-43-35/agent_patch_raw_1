Based on the context provided and the issue described, the primary goal is to ensure that a `ValueError` thrown by URL parsing utilities (like `urlsplit`) during the URL validation process in Django's `URLValidator` is caught and handled appropriately, raising a `ValidationError` instead. This approach prevents unhandled exceptions from propagating and allows Django forms to display user-friendly error messages.

Here's a proposed patch to address the issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/validators.py</file>
<original>                except ValueError:  # for example, "Invalid IPv6 URL"
                    raise ValidationError(self.message, code=self.code, params={'value': value})</original>
<patched>                except ValueError as e:  # for example, "Invalid IPv6 URL"
                    raise ValidationError(self.message, code=self.code, params={'value': value, 'exception': str(e)})</patched>
```

This modification ensures that when a `ValueError` is caught during the URL validation process, specifically for cases like "Invalid IPv6 URL", it is re-raised as a `ValidationError` with additional context about the original exception. This change can help in debugging and provides more informative error messages to the developers and users.

Please note, the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the broader context of the Django project and its error handling conventions. This patch assumes that adding the original exception's message to the `params` dictionary of `ValidationError` is an acceptable practice for providing more context about the error.
