Given the context and the identified issue with the `_separable` function in handling nested `CompoundModel` instances, a potential patch could involve refining how the separability of left and right sub-models is combined. The issue seems to arise from the simplistic combination of separability results without considering the intricacies of nested models. A more nuanced approach might be required to accurately reflect the separability of complex, nested structures.

Here's a proposed patch that introduces a more detailed handling mechanism for combining the separability of sub-models in a `CompoundModel`. This patch assumes that additional logic is needed to correctly combine these results, especially for operations that do not inherently preserve separability (e.g., certain types of model chaining).

# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/modeling/separable.py</file>
<original>elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
    sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
    sepright = _separable(transform.right)
    return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)</original>
<patched>elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
    sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
    sepright = _separable(transform.right)
    # Introduce a more nuanced combination of separability results for nested CompoundModels
    if transform.op in ['&', '|']:  # Assuming '&' and '|' are the primary operators for CompoundModels
        # Directly combine separability for parallel ('&') and series ('|') operations
        combined_separability = _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)
    else:
        # For other operations, introduce custom logic or fallback to a conservative approach
        # This is a placeholder for additional logic that might be needed for specific operations
        combined_separability = np.logical_and(sepleft, sepright)  # Example conservative approach
    return combined_separability</patched>
```

This modification introduces a conditional handling based on the type of operation (`op`) that combines the sub-models. It suggests a direct combination for parallel and series operations, which are common in compound models. For other types of operations, it proposes a conservative approach that only considers outputs separable if both sub-models are separable. This is a simplified example, and further refinement may be necessary based on the specific semantics of each operation and how they affect the separability of model outputs.

Note: The actual implementation of additional logic for specific operations would require a deeper understanding of the semantics of those operations and how they interact with the concept of separability in the context of astropy's modeling framework.
