Given the context and the analysis, it seems the issue might not be directly in the `snapshot_files` or `tick` methods themselves but rather in how `manage.py` is considered among the files to watch. Since the `snapshot_files` method relies on `self.watched_files()` to determine which files to monitor, and assuming `manage.py` changes are not being detected, the issue could be with how `manage.py` is included in the list of watched files. However, without explicit evidence that `manage.py` is being excluded or a clear directive on how to ensure its inclusion, we can propose a hypothetical patch that ensures `manage.py` is always considered by the autoreload mechanism.

Please note, this patch is speculative and assumes that the root cause is `manage.py` not being included in the watched files. The actual implementation might require a deeper understanding of how `watched_files` is populated and how `manage.py` is handled in different environments or Django settings.

        for file in self.watched_files():
            if file in seen_files:
                continue
            try:
                mtime = file.stat().st_mtime
            except OSError:
                # This is thrown when the file does not exist.
                continue
            seen_files.add(file)
            yield file, mtime</original>

def snapshot_files(self):
        # Ensure manage.py is always watched, adjust the path as necessary.
        manage_py = pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / 'manage.py'
        # watched_files may produce duplicate paths if globs overlap.
        seen_files = set([manage_py])
        for file in self.watched_files():
            if file in seen_files:
                continue
            try:
                mtime = file.stat().st_mtime
            except OSError:
                # This is thrown when the file does not exist.
                continue
            seen_files.add(file)
            yield file, mtime</patched>
```

This patch explicitly adds `manage.py` to the set of `seen_files` at the beginning of the `snapshot_files` method. This ensures that `manage.py` is always considered as part of the watched files, assuming the path to `manage.py` is correctly resolved relative to the location of the `autoreload.py` file. Adjustments may be necessary to correctly locate `manage.py` based on the project structure.

Remember, this patch is based on an assumption and should be tested thoroughly in the environment where the issue was reported. Further investigation might be required to confirm the root cause and to ensure that this patch addresses the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
