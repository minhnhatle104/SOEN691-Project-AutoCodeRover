This is not a problem in v5.2.\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n### Expected behavior\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n### How to Reproduce\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\n```\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\n[ 8,  0,  1],\n[ 2,  1,  0]])\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n```\n### Versions\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\nastropy 5.3\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\nNumpy 1.24.3\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\nScipy 1.10.1\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have discovered that the `NDDataRef` class is located in the file `astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py`. This class inherits from several mixins, including `NDArithmeticMixin`, which suggests that arithmetic operations, such as multiplication, are likely handled by one of these mixins rather than directly within the `NDDataRef` class itself. This is further supported by the fact that a direct search for the `multiply` method within `NDDataRef` yielded no results.\n\nGiven this information, our next steps should focus on the `NDArithmeticMixin` since the issue involves arithmetic operations and mask handling. Specifically, we need to understand how the `NDArithmeticMixin` implements arithmetic operations and how it deals with masks, especially in scenarios where one of the operands does not have a mask. This will likely involve looking into how the `handle_mask` parameter is used during these operations.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n\n1. Search for the `NDArithmeticMixin` class to understand its structure and the methods it provides for arithmetic operations.\n2. Since the `multiply` method was not found directly in `NDDataRef`, it's likely implemented or facilitated by the `NDArithmeticMixin`. We should search for arithmetic-related methods within this mixin, particularly those that might involve the `handle_mask` parameter or mask propagation logic.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `NDArithmeticMixin` class to get a better understanding of how arithmetic operations are implemented and how it might be contributing to the issue at hand."
