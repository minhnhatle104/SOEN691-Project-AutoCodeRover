            return deepcopy(operand.mask)

```

This patch corrects the logic in the `_arithmetic_mask` method to ensure that when one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask is correctly copied over to the result, avoiding the TypeError when attempting to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and `NoneType`. The condition checks are adjusted to correctly identify when only one of the operands has a mask and to return a deep copy of that mask, ensuring that the operation does not fail due to type mismatches.
