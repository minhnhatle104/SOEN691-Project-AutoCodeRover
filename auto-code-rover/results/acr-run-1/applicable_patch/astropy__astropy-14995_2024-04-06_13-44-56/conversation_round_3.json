This is not a problem in v5.2.\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n### Expected behavior\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n### How to Reproduce\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\n```\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\n[ 8,  0,  1],\n[ 2,  1,  0]])\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n```\n### Versions\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\nastropy 5.3\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\nNumpy 1.24.3\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\nScipy 1.10.1\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\n</issue>"

This is further supported by the fact that a direct search for the `multiply` method within `NDDataRef` yielded no results.\n\nGiven this information, our next steps should focus on the `NDArithmeticMixin` since the issue involves arithmetic operations and mask handling. Specifically, we need to understand how the `NDArithmeticMixin` implements arithmetic operations and how it deals with masks, especially in scenarios where one of the operands does not have a mask. This will likely involve looking into how the `handle_mask` parameter is used during these operations.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n\n1. Search for the `NDArithmeticMixin` class to understand its structure and the methods it provides for arithmetic operations.\n2. Since the `multiply` method was not found directly in `NDDataRef`, it's likely implemented or facilitated by the `NDArithmeticMixin`. We should search for arithmetic-related methods within this mixin, particularly those that might involve the `handle_mask` parameter or mask propagation logic.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `NDArithmeticMixin` class to get a better understanding of how arithmetic operations are implemented and how it might be contributing to the issue at hand."

        "content": "With the information obtained from the search result for the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, we can now pinpoint where the issue might be occurring and understand the mechanism behind arithmetic operations, including mask handling, in the `NDDataRef` objects. The `NDArithmeticMixin` class provides the arithmetic functionality for `NDDataRef` through a series of methods, including `_arithmetic`, which is a central method for performing operations, and specific methods for handling different aspects of the operation, such as `_arithmetic_mask` for dealing with masks.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem arises during mask propagation when performing arithmetic operations, specifically when one of the operands does not have a mask, and `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` is used. The error indicates a type mismatch when attempting to apply a bitwise operation between an integer and a `NoneType`, which suggests that the issue lies in how the absence of a mask is handled.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Central Method for Arithmetic Operations**: The `_arithmetic` method orchestrates the arithmetic operation, including calling other methods to handle masks, uncertainties, metadata, and WCS (World Coordinate System) information. However, the description of the issue points specifically to how masks are handled during these operations.\n\n- **Mask Handling Method**: The `_arithmetic_mask` method is likely where the issue occurs. This method is responsible for handling mask propagation during arithmetic operations. The error described in the issue suggests that when one operand does not have a mask, the operation fails because it attempts to perform a bitwise operation (`np.bitwise_or`) on an integer and `None`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Bug Location**: The bug is likely located in the `_arithmetic_mask` method within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. This method is part of the mask handling logic during arithmetic operations and is where the type mismatch error (attempting to perform a bitwise operation on an integer and `None`) likely originates.\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to modify the `_arithmetic_mask` method to correctly handle cases where one of the operands does not have a mask. Specifically, the method should be able to gracefully handle `None` values for masks, ensuring that the presence or absence of a mask in one operand does not lead to type mismatch errors when performing bitwise operations."
