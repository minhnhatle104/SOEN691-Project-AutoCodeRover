            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to gather more context about how `constrained_layout` and `plt.subplots_adjust` are implemented and interact within the Matplotlib codebase. Given the information in the issue, I will start by searching for the implementation of `subplots_adjust` and any references to `constrained_layout` within relevant classes or methods. Additionally, I'll look into the initialization or handling of figures and subplots to understand where the warning might be generated from.\n\nHere are the API calls I will make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"subplots_adjust\")` - This will help identify where `subplots_adjust` is defined and possibly give insight into how it's checking for `constrained_layout` compatibility.\n2. `search_code(\"constrained_layout=False\")` - This will help find instances where `constrained_layout` is being set or checked, which could lead to the generation of the warning.\n3. `search_method(\"plt.subplots\")` - Since the issue arises when creating subplots, understanding how this method works and any references to `constrained_layout` within it could be crucial.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and formulating a patch."
