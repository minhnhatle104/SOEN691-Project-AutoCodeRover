        "content": "Given the results from the search API calls, it appears there was an issue locating the `Matrix` class and its methods (`is_upper` and `__getitem__`) within the codebase. This could be due to several reasons, such as the class or methods being dynamically generated, part of a submodule not directly searchable with the provided API calls, or simply a misidentification of the class or method names.\n\nGiven the traceback provided in the issue description, we know that the `Matrix` class and the methods in question do exist within the `sympy.matrices` namespace. The traceback specifically references `sympy/matrices/matrices.py` and `sympy/matrices/dense.py`, which suggests that the `Matrix` functionality is split across multiple files and possibly involves multiple classes or a class hierarchy.\n\nSince the direct search for the `Matrix` class and the specific methods did not yield results, we can infer that the issue might require a more nuanced approach to locate the relevant code. The error originates from an attempt to access an index that is out of range, which suggests that the logic within `is_upper` does not correctly account for the dimensions of non-square matrices.\n\nWithout direct access to the codebase through the search API, we can still propose a solution based on the information provided in the issue description. The problem arises because the `is_upper` method iterates over indices that are not valid for matrices where the number of rows exceeds the number of columns. A potential patch would involve modifying the `is_upper` method to ensure it does not attempt to access indices outside the bounds of the matrix.\n\nA conceptual patch could look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef is_upper(self):\n    return all(self[i, j].is_zero for i in range(1, self.rows) for j in range(min(i, self.cols)))\n```\n\nThis modification to the `is_upper` method ensures that the inner loop only iterates up to the number of columns (`self.cols`), preventing attempts to access invalid indices in matrices where the number of rows is greater than the number of columns. This should resolve the `IndexError` encountered when calling `is_upper` on a 4x2 matrix of zeros.\n\nWithout direct access to the implementation details of the `Matrix` class and its methods, this solution is speculative and would need to be tested and possibly adjusted to fit the actual code structure and logic."
