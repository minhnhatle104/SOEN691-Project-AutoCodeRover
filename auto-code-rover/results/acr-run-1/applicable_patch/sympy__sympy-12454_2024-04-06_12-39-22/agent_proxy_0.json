Given the traceback and the description of the issue, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Matrix\")`: This will help us understand the structure of the `Matrix` class, which seems to be central to the issue.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"is_upper\", \"Matrix\")`: This will provide us with the implementation details of the `is_upper` method within the `Matrix` class.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__getitem__\", \"Matrix\")`: Since the error occurs when accessing an element of the matrix, understanding how `__getitem__` is implemented will be crucial.\n\nThese calls should give us a comprehensive view of how matrices are handled in the codebase, specifically how they determine if a matrix is upper triangular and how elements are accessed, which is directly related to the bug described."
