These modifications introduce a method to handle the LaTeX printing of `Trace` objects in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and add a `_latex` method to the `Trace` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py` to ensure that `Trace` objects are printed correctly in LaTeX format. This approach ensures that the `Trace` function is recognized and that the inner expression is correctly formatted in LaTeX, addressing the issue described.
