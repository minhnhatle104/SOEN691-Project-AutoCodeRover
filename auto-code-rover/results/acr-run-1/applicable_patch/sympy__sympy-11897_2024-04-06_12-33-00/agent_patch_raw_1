These modifications aim to address the inconsistencies between the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer by adjusting the handling of exponential expressions and rational numbers to better align with the pretty printer's output. The first modification changes the way exponential expressions are printed to use LaTeX's `\exp` function, which is more consistent with the pretty printer's style. The second modification ensures that fractions are always printed using the `\frac` command, regardless of the `fold_short_frac` setting, to align with the pretty printer's formatting.
