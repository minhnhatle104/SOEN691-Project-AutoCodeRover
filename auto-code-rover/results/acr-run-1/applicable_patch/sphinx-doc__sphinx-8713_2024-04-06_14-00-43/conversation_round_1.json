        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered the following context about the issue and the project structure:\n\n1. **NumpyDocstring Class**: The `NumpyDocstring` class is located in `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py`. This class does not directly contain methods named `_parse_other_parameters_section` or `_parse_parameters_section`, which were mentioned in the issue. This could mean that these methods might have been renamed, or they are dynamically defined or indirectly related to the processing of docstrings in some other way.\n\n2. **Search for Specific Methods**: The search for `_parse_other_parameters_section` and `_parse_parameters_section` in the `NumpyDocstring` class did not yield any results. This suggests that either the issue description refers to outdated method names, or these methods are part of a different workflow or subclass not directly visible in the `NumpyDocstring` class.\n\n3. **Usage of `napoleon_use_param`**: The search for `napoleon_use_param` returned 24 snippets across three files: `docstring.py`, `__init__.py`, and `test_ext_napoleon_docstring.py`. This indicates that `napoleon_use_param` is a configuration option that is widely used within the napoleon extension, affecting how parameters are parsed and rendered in the documentation.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n- Reviewing the `NumpyDocstring` class in `docstring.py` to understand its role in parsing and rendering docstrings, especially focusing on how it handles parameter sections.\n- Investigating the usage of `napoleon_use_param` in `docstring.py` and `__init__.py` to understand how this configuration option influences the rendering of parameters and other parameters sections.\n- Since the specific methods mentioned in the issue were not found, it might be necessary to look into how sections of docstrings are generally parsed and formatted within the `NumpyDocstring` class or related classes/modules. This could involve searching for methods that handle docstring sections or fields in a more general sense.\n\nTo proceed, we might need to conduct more targeted searches based on the insights gathered or directly review the relevant files (`docstring.py`, `__init__.py`) to understand how the `napoleon_use_param` configuration is implemented and how it could be extended or modified to address the issue at hand."
