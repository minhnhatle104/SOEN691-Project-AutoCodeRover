This patch adds a check before attempting to sympify `other` in the `__eq__` method of the `Basic` class. If `other` is a string, it immediately returns `False` instead of attempting to sympify it. This prevents the evaluation of string representations that could execute arbitrary code, addressing the security concern raised in the issue. This is a simple and effective way to mitigate the risk without altering the behavior of `sympify` or the `__eq__` method for non-string inputs.
