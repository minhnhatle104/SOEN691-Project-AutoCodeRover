Given the nature of the issue, which involves the inability to pickle objects due to the presence of weak references, and based on the provided context, a potential patch would involve ensuring that the alignment groups (`_align_label_groups`) do not prevent the figure from being pickled. This might be achieved by either modifying how these groups are stored or by implementing custom pickling methods for the `FigureBase` class. However, without direct access to the full implementation details of the `_align_label_groups` or the `join` method it uses, the patch will focus on a conceptual approach to address the pickling issue.

Since the specific implementation of `_align_label_groups` and how it handles weak references is not detailed in the provided context, the patch will suggest a general approach to ensure that objects involved in alignment can be pickled.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>self._align_label_groups['x'].join(ax, axc)</original>
<patched># Assuming _align_label_groups or its usage involves weak references that are not pickleable
# A potential approach is to ensure that references within _align_label_groups are strong references
# or to provide a custom pickling strategy for the FigureBase class that handles _align_label_groups appropriately.

# This is a placeholder for the conceptual approach, as the exact implementation would depend on the internal workings of _align_label_groups
self._align_label_groups['x'].join(ax, axc)  # Ensure this operation does not introduce unpickleable weak references</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>self._align_label_groups['y'].join(ax, axc)</original>
<patched># Similar to modification 1, ensure that the operation does not introduce unpickleable weak references.
self._align_label_groups['y'].join(ax, axc)  # Ensure this operation does not introduce unpickleable weak references</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>class FigureBase:
    # Class implementation...</original>
<patched>class FigureBase:
    import copyreg

    def __reduce__(self):
        # Custom reduce function to handle pickling of the FigureBase object, especially _align_label_groups
        # This is a conceptual placeholder. The actual implementation would need to handle the specifics of _align_label_groups
        # and ensure that all references within it are pickleable or appropriately reconstructed during unpickling.
        getstate = self.__dict__.copy()
        # Handle _align_label_groups specifically if needed here
        return (self.__class__, (), getstate)

    # Rest of the class implementation...</patched>
```

These modifications are conceptual and aim to highlight potential approaches to resolving the pickling issue related to `align_labels`, `align_xlabels`, and `align_ylabels` methods in Matplotlib's `FigureBase` class. The exact implementation would require a deeper understanding of the internal workings of `_align_label_groups` and the `join` method it uses, as well as testing to ensure that the modifications do not affect the intended functionality of label alignment.
