Given the context and the nature of the recursion error, it appears that the issue might not be directly related to the implementation of `is_zero` or `eval` methods for hyperbolic functions, but rather how complex expressions involving these functions are handled. The recursion error suggests that there might be a loop or an unhandled case that causes infinite recursion when trying to determine if the expression is zero.

However, without a specific indication of a faulty implementation from the provided code snippets, proposing a precise patch is challenging. A common cause for such recursion errors in symbolic computation libraries like SymPy is the lack of a base case or a missing condition that leads to repeated evaluation of an expression without making progress towards simplification or evaluation.

A hypothetical patch could involve adding a condition to catch expressions that could lead to recursion, but without a clear bug in the provided snippets, this is speculative. For educational purposes, here's an example of how one might attempt to prevent infinite recursion by adding a base case or additional condition. This is a generic example and might not directly apply to the issue at hand without further debugging to identify the exact cause of the recursion.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py</file>
<original>
if arg.func == acosh:
    x = arg.args[0]
    return sqrt(x - 1) * sqrt(x + 1)
</original>
<patched>
from sympy.core.symbol import Symbol
if arg.func == acosh:
    x = arg.args[0]
    # Hypothetical check to prevent recursion
    if isinstance(x, Symbol):
        return None  # or some other base case
    return sqrt(x - 1) * sqrt(x + 1)
</patched>
```

This modification checks if the argument `x` of `acosh` is a symbol and, if so, avoids further processing that could lead to recursion. This is a simplistic approach and might not solve the actual issue but illustrates the kind of condition that could be added to prevent recursion. The actual solution would require identifying the specific expression or condition that leads to infinite recursion and handling it appropriately.
