This patch introduces a check at the beginning of the `Axes3D.draw` method to ensure that the entire 3D axes will not be drawn if it is set to not visible. This directly addresses the issue where calling `set_visible(False)` on an `Axes3D` instance does not hide the axes as expected. By returning early from the `draw` method when the axes are set to be invisible, we prevent any further drawing operations, including those of its children, effectively making the axes and its contents not visible.
