Given the information from the issue, it seems that the `set_visible` method does not behave as expected when applied to an axis with a 3D projection. To gather more context and find a potential solution, we should start by looking into the classes and methods involved in this functionality.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the class that handles the 3D projection. Since the issue mentions using a 3D projection via `subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'}`, it's likely that there's a specific class in Matplotlib that handles 3D axes. Let's start by searching for this class.\n\nNext, we need to understand how the `set_visible` method is implemented for this class or its parent classes, as the issue specifically mentions that calling `ax1.set_visible(False)` does not work as expected.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles 3D projections: `search_class(\"3D\")`\n2. Search for the implementation of the `set_visible` method within the context of 3D projections or axes: `search_method(\"set_visible\")`\n\nThese searches should provide us with enough context to understand why `set_visible` is not working as expected for 3D projections and guide us towards developing a patch."

However, the initial search for a class specifically named or containing \"3D\" did not yield any results, which suggests that the class handling 3D projections might not be straightforwardly named or that the search term was too generic.\n\nGiven the locations of the `set_visible` method, we have a few potential leads:\n\n1. **`lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py`**: This file might contain custom axes implementations, possibly including those that can handle 3D projections. However, the `mpl_toolkits` namespace often contains additional tools and may not directly relate to the core 3D projection functionality.\n\n2. **`lib/matplotlib/artist.py`**: This file is a more promising lead. The `Artist` class in Matplotlib is a base class for all objects that are rendered on the canvas, including plots, texts, lines, etc. Since the `set_visible` method is part of this file, it's likely that the issue with visibility not being properly set for 3D projections could be related to how 3D axes or their components inherit from or interact with the `Artist` class.\n\n3. **`lib/matplotlib/widgets.py`**: This file contains implementations for interactive widgets. The presence of `set_visible` methods here likely pertains to the visibility of interactive components and might be less relevant to the issue at hand, which deals with the visibility of 3D subplots.\n\nGiven this context, the most relevant next step would be to dive deeper into how 3D projections are handled within Matplotlib and how they interact with the `Artist` class. Specifically, we should investigate the `Artist` class implementation of `set_visible` to understand its intended behavior and why it might not be working as expected for 3D axes.\n\nHowever, since the direct search for a 3D class did not yield results, it might be necessary to look into how Matplotlib typically handles 3D projections. It's known that Matplotlib uses the `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` module for 3D plotting. This module likely extends or interacts with base Matplotlib classes to add 3D capabilities.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n\n1. Investigate the `set_visible` implementation in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` to understand its base functionality.\n2. Look into how 3D axes are implemented in Matplotlib, focusing on their relationship with the `Artist` class or methods. This might require a more targeted search now that we know the general area of interest.\n\nGiven the current context, a direct patch or solution is not yet clear without further investigation into these components."

The method updates the `_visible` attribute of the artist and marks the artist as changed (`self.stale = True`). This is a straightforward implementation that should, in theory, work for all artist objects, including 3D axes.\n\n### Insights\n\n- The fact that `set_visible` is not working as expected for 3D projections suggests that the issue may not lie within the `set_visible` method itself but rather in how 3D axes or their components interact with visibility settings or how they are redrawn (or not redrawn) when their visibility changes.\n\n- Since the search for `projection='3d'` in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` did not yield results, it's possible that the way 3D projections are initiated or managed does not directly involve setting a `projection` attribute to `'3d'` in the manner we searched for. This could imply that the initialization of 3D axes involves a different mechanism or that the search term was too specific.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the simplicity of the `set_visible` method's implementation, the problem likely lies in how 3D axes are redrawn (or not) upon visibility changes. This could involve the rendering pipeline, event handling, or the way 3D axes are integrated into the broader Matplotlib figure structure.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, we would need to understand:\n\n1. **How 3D Axes are Redrawn**: Investigating the rendering pipeline for 3D axes could reveal why visibility changes are not reflected as expected. This might involve looking into methods related to figure drawing, rendering, and event handling in the context of 3D plotting.\n\n2. **Integration of 3D Axes with Figure Structure**: Understanding how 3D axes are integrated into the figure and how they interact with the figure's redraw or refresh mechanisms could provide insights. This might involve exploring the figure class and how it manages its child artists, including 3D axes.\n\nGiven the current context, a direct patch or solution is not immediately apparent without further investigation into these components. The issue seems to be more complex, involving the interaction between 3D axes and the broader rendering and visibility management mechanisms in Matplotlib."
