The issue specifically mentions a problem with handling multiline `RawSQL` expressions in the `order_by` clause, which leads to incorrect removal of duplicate ordering clauses due to the way lines are compared.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls would be necessary to get more context and potentially identify where the bug might be located and how it can be addressed:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SQLCompiler\")`: This will help us find the file or files where the `SQLCompiler` class is defined. Understanding the structure of this class is crucial since the issue is located within one of its methods.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get_order_by\", \"SQLCompiler\")`: Since the issue specifically mentions a bug in the `get_order_by` method of the `SQLCompiler` class, this call will help us locate the method within the class and understand how it's currently implemented.\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient context to begin addressing the issue described."
