Given the context and the issue described, it seems that the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the documentation might not be directly related to the `format_args` or `format_signature` methods themselves but rather how these methods are utilized and how the documentation strings they produce are integrated into the final documentation output. However, without a clear bug in the provided code snippets and based on the issue description, a hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled uniquely to prevent duplication when the documentation is generated.

Since the issue describes a problem with the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the documentation and not directly with the logic within `format_args` or `format_signature`, a direct patch to these methods from the provided snippets might not be feasible without a deeper understanding of how these methods' outputs are used.

However, I can provide a general approach to addressing issues like this in documentation generation tools:

1. Ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are documented only once by checking if they have already been included in the documentation string before appending them.
2. If the issue were related to the handling of `*args` and `**kwargs` within these methods, one approach could be to modify how these arguments are processed to ensure they are not duplicated.

Since the exact cause of the duplication is not clear from the provided snippets and without an identifiable bug in the snippets, I'll illustrate a hypothetical modification that could be made if the issue were related to the handling of `*args` and `**kwargs` in a way that leads to their duplication:

# Hypothetical modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
if self.config.strip_signature_backslash:
    # escape backslashes for reST
    args = args.replace('\\', '\\\\')
return args
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical check to prevent duplication of *args and **kwargs documentation
if not self._has_documented_variadic_args:
    if self.config.strip_signature_backslash:
        # escape backslashes for reST
        args = args.replace('\\', '\\\\')
    self._has_documented_variadic_args = True
    return args
else:
    return ''  # Skip adding *args and **kwargs if already documented
</patched>
```

This modification is purely illustrative and assumes the existence of a hypothetical flag `_has_documented_variadic_args` to track whether `*args` and `**kwargs` have already been documented, to prevent their duplication. In practice, the solution would require a thorough investigation into how the documentation strings are generated and integrated, ensuring that any such flags or checks are appropriately implemented and managed within the context of the entire documentation generation process.
