Given the context and the issue described, the problem seems to stem from the handling of array arguments in the Cython backend of `autowrap`. Specifically, when array arguments are not directly used in the expression, the generated C function signature incorrectly treats these arguments as scalars rather than pointers or arrays. To address this, we need to ensure that the code generation process correctly identifies and handles array arguments, even when they are not explicitly used in the expression.

Here's a proposed patch that ensures array arguments are correctly handled by modifying the `_prepare_files` method in the `CythonCodeWrapper` class to include array argument handling logic:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/utilities/autowrap.py</file>
<original>ext_args = [repr(self.module_name), repr([pyxfilename, codefilename])]</original>
<patched>ext_args = [repr(self.module_name), repr([pyxfilename, codefilename])]
# Ensure array arguments are correctly handled as pointers
if any(isinstance(arg, MatrixSymbol) for arg in routine.arguments):
    self._need_numpy = True
    if 'np.get_include()' not in self._include_dirs:
        self._include_dirs.append('np.get_include()')</patched>
```

This modification ensures that if any of the arguments to the routine are instances of `MatrixSymbol` (indicating an array argument), the necessary NumPy include directory is added to the include directories for compilation. This is a simplistic approach and might need refinement based on further testing and specific requirements of the `autowrap` functionality.

Please note, this patch assumes that the presence of a `MatrixSymbol` in the arguments is a sufficient condition to treat an argument as an array. Depending on the specifics of the `autowrap` implementation and how array arguments are represented, additional logic may be required to accurately identify and handle all cases of array arguments. Further testing and validation are recommended to ensure that this patch correctly addresses the issue in all scenarios.
