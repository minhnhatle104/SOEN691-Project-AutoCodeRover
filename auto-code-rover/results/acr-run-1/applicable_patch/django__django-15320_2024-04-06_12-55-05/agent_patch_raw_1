This patch modifies the `__init__` method of the `Subquery` class to set the `subquery` attribute of the `query` object to `True`. This change addresses the issue by ensuring that the query is correctly marked as a subquery, which should influence how its SQL is generated and avoid the incorrect trimming of the SQL string in the `as_sql` method.
