These modifications address the issue by ensuring that the `discrete_features` parameter is correctly handled when it is not 'auto'. The first modification adds a check to ensure that `discrete_features` is either 'auto', a boolean, an array-like object, or a boolean mask, and raises a ValueError if not. The second modification wraps the array handling in a try-except block to catch TypeErrors that may arise from incorrect usage of the `discrete_features` parameter, providing a clearer error message to the user.
