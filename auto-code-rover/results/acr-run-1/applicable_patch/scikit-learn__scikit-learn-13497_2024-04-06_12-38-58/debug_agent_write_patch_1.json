        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the `_estimate_mi` method in the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file, we can identify a few key points relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **Issue Description**: The issue points out that there is a comparison in the `_estimate_mi` function where `discrete_features` is checked against the string `'auto'`. However, `discrete_features` can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, it suggests that the function might not have been tested with `discrete_features` not equal to `'auto'`.\n\n2. **Current Implementation**:\n    - The `discrete_features` parameter can take the values `'auto'`, a boolean, or an array-like object. If `'auto'`, it is determined based on whether `X` is sparse or dense.\n    - If `discrete_features` is a boolean, a mask is created for all features as either discrete or continuous.\n    - If `discrete_features` is array-like, it is converted to a numpy array. If the dtype of this array is not boolean, a new boolean mask is created where indices in `discrete_features` are marked as True (discrete).\n    - Continuous features in a sparse matrix `X` are not allowed, raising a ValueError if found.\n\n3. **Potential Solutions**:\n    - The comparison `if discrete_features == 'auto':` is valid but needs additional handling or checks to ensure compatibility with future numpy versions and to handle cases where `discrete_features` is not `'auto'` but an array or boolean.\n    - Enhance testing to cover scenarios where `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in these cases.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n    - Review and possibly refactor the handling of `discrete_features` to ensure it's robust and future-proof.\n    - Implement additional unit tests to cover the scenarios mentioned in the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to draft a patch that addresses these concerns, ensuring that the comparison and handling of `discrete_features` are both correct and efficient, and that adequate tests are in place."
