```python
<file>astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py</file>
<original>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</original>
<patched>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field[:] = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the modified `output_field`, with 'E' replaced by 'D', is correctly assigned back to `output_field` itself. This is achieved by using `output_field[:] =` which ensures that the changes are made in place on the `output_field` array.
