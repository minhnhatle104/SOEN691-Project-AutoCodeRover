Specifically, we should look into how filtering is handled in the Django model\'s query mechanism, and how the `filterable` attribute of the `ProductMetaDataType` model might be interfering with this process. \n\nGiven the details in the issue, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Investigate the `ProductMetaDataType` model to understand its structure and any custom methods that might influence its behavior in queries.\n2.

Look into the `filter` method implementation in Django\'s query system to understand how it processes model fields and why it might raise a `NotSupportedError` for the `ProductMetaDataType`.\n4. Since the error mentions a check for filterability (`check_filterable`), it\'s crucial to understand how and where this check is implemented.\n\nBased on these points, the following search API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_class("ProductMetaDataType")`\n- `search_class("ProductMetaData")`\n- `search_method("filter")`\n- `search_method("check_filterable")`', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

2024-04-06 14:06:25 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the results from the search API calls, we can draw several conclusions and insights into the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Classes Not Found**: The search for the `ProductMetaDataType` and `ProductMetaData` classes yielded no results. This could imply that these models are part of a custom app within the Django project that wasn't directly accessible by the search API or they are dynamically defined in a way that the search API couldn't locate them. However, the description of the issue provides enough context to understand their structure and relationships.\n\n2. **`filter` Method**: The `filter` method was found in several files, but the most relevant occurrence is in `django/db/models/query.py`. This location is consistent with the traceback provided in the issue, indicating that the error arises from the core Django ORM's handling of query filtering. The `filter` method in Django is used to narrow down querysets based on given parameters, and it's a fundamental part of interacting with the database in Django projects.\n\n3. **`check_filterable` Method**: The `check_filterable` method found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` within the `Query` class is directly related to the error. The method's purpose is to raise an error if an expression (in this case, a model field or a related object) cannot be used in a WHERE clause of a SQL query. The code snippet shows that it checks for an attribute named `filterable` on the expression object, and if this attribute is set to `False`, it raises a `NotSupportedError`. This behavior directly correlates with the issue described, where having a field named `filterable` set to `False` in the `ProductMetaDataType` model leads to the error.\n\nGiven these insights, the root cause of the issue seems to be the naming conflict between the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` model and the internal mechanism of Django's ORM that checks if an expression is filterable using a similarly named attribute. The ORM does not expect model fields to interfere with its internal attribute checks, leading to unintended behavior when a field named `filterable` exists.\n\nThe next step would be to consider potential solutions to resolve this naming conflict without breaking existing functionality or requiring significant changes to the Django ORM's internal workings.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

             '1. **Classes Not Found**: The search for the `ProductMetaDataType` and `ProductMetaData` classes yielded no results. This could imply that these '

             "way that the search API couldn't locate them. However, the description of the issue provides enough context to understand their structure and "

             '2. **`filter` Method**: The `filter` method was found in several files, but the most relevant occurrence is in `django/db/models/query.py`. This '
             "location is consistent with the traceback provided in the issue, indicating that the error arises from the core Django ORM's handling of query "
             "filtering. The `filter` method in Django is used to narrow down querysets based on given parameters, and it's a fundamental part of interacting "
             'with the database in Django projects.\n'
             '\n'
             '3. **`check_filterable` Method**: The `check_filterable` method found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` within the `Query` class is directly '
             "related to the error. The method's purpose is to raise an error if an expression (in this case, a model field or a related object) cannot be "
             'used in a WHERE clause of a SQL query. The code snippet shows that it checks for an attribute named `filterable` on the expression object, and '
             'if this attribute is set to `False`, it raises a `NotSupportedError`. This behavior directly correlates with the issue described, where having a '
             'field named `filterable` set to `False` in the `ProductMetaDataType` model leads to the error.\n'
             '\n'
             'Given these insights, the root cause of the issue seems to be the naming conflict between the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` '
             "model and the internal mechanism of Django's ORM that checks if an expression is filterable using a similarly named attribute. The ORM does not "
