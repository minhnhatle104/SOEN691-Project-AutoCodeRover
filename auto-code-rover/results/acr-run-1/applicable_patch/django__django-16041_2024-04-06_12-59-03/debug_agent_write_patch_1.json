Given the information provided in the issue, we can make the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles formsets to understand how `empty_form` is generated and how `form_kwargs` are passed to it. Since Django uses a `BaseFormSet` class for formset operations, we'll start there:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")`\n\n2. We need to find out how `empty_permitted` is processed within the form class, as this flag is directly related to the issue. Django forms are based on a `BaseForm` class, so we'll look into that:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseForm\")`\n\n3. The issue description mentions that the problem occurs when rendering the template that uses a formset's `empty_form`. It would be useful to see how `empty_form` is defined or generated within the formset class. Therefore, we should search for the `empty_form` property or method within the `BaseFormSet` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide enough context to understand how `empty_permitted` is supposed to work with formsets and how the `empty_form` is generated, which is crucial for addressing the issue described."

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, let's analyze the context to understand how to address the issue described in the bug report.\n\n1. **BaseFormSet Class**: The `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` is responsible for handling a collection of forms. It has several properties and methods that manage the formset's behavior, including `empty_form`, which generates an empty form template for use on the client side. The constructor of `BaseFormSet` accepts `form_kwargs` among other parameters, which allows passing custom arguments to the forms within the formset.\n\n2. **BaseForm Class**: The search for the `BaseForm` class indicates its presence in `django/forms/forms.py`. Although the specific methods and properties of `BaseForm` were not directly returned from the search, it's important to note that this class is the base for all Django forms. It likely handles the `empty_permitted` argument, which controls whether a form is allowed to be empty.\n\n3. **empty_form Method in BaseFormSet**: The `empty_form` method generates an empty form with `empty_permitted=True`, and it uses `self.get_form_kwargs(None)` to pass additional keyword arguments to the form. This method sets `empty_permitted` to `True` explicitly, which aligns with the expected behavior that an empty form should not require validation. However, the issue arises when `form_kwargs` explicitly contains `empty_permitted` with a value of either `True` or `False`, leading to a `KeyError` during rendering.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how `empty_form` in `BaseFormSet` handles `form_kwargs` when `empty_permitted` is explicitly set. Since `empty_form` explicitly sets `empty_permitted=True`, passing `empty_permitted` via `form_kwargs` might be causing conflicts or unexpected behavior.\n\nTo address the issue, a potential solution could involve modifying the `empty_form` method to either ignore `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` or to handle it in a way that prevents the `KeyError` during rendering. This would ensure that `empty_form` behaves as expected, regardless of the `empty_permitted` value passed through `form_kwargs`.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the `empty_form` method in the `BaseFormSet` class to handle `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` appropriately."
