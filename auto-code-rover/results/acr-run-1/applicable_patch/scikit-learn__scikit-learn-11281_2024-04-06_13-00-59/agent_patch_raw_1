These modifications introduce a `fit_predict` method to the `GaussianMixture` class, making it more consistent with the interface provided by clusterers. Additionally, it ensures that the `GaussianMixture` class inherits from `ClusterMixin` to further align with clustering API conventions in scikit-learn. The `predict` method is also explicitly included here for clarity, although it may already exist in the class with similar functionality. This approach enhances the usability of the `GaussianMixture` model by providing a more familiar interface to users accustomed to the clustering models in scikit-learn.
