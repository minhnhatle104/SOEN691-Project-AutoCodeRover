Given the constraints and the need to include non-whitespace original code snippets for the third modification, let's adjust the approach. Since the `predict` method might already exist or we lack a specific original snippet to modify, I'll focus on ensuring the first two modifications are correctly formatted and applicable.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py</file>
<original>class GaussianMixture(BaseMixture):</original>
<patched>from sklearn.base import ClusterMixin

class GaussianMixture(BaseMixture, ClusterMixin):</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py</file>
<original>def _compute_lower_bound(self, _, log_prob_norm):
        return log_prob_norm</original>
<patched>def _compute_lower_bound(self, _, log_prob_norm):
        return log_prob_norm

    def fit_predict(self, X, y=None):
        """Estimate model parameters using X and predict the labels for X.
        
        The method fits the model n_init times and sets the parameters with
        which the model has the largest likelihood or lower bound. After
        fitting, it predicts the closest component for each sample in X.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            List of n_features-dimensional data points. Each row
            corresponds to a single data point.
        
        y : Ignored
            Not used, present here for API consistency by convention.
        
        Returns
        -------
        labels : array, shape (n_samples,)
            Component labels.
        """
        self.fit(X)
        return self.predict(X)</patched>
```

Given the feedback and the constraints, I will not attempt a third modification without a specific original code snippet to modify. The first two modifications address the main concerns raised in the issue: aligning the `GaussianMixture` class more closely with clustering interfaces by inheriting from `ClusterMixin` and adding a `fit_predict` method to streamline the workflow for users.
