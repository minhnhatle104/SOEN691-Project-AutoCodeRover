        The method fits the model n_init times and sets the parameters with
        which the model has the largest likelihood or lower bound. After
        fitting, it predicts the closest component for each sample in X.

        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)

            corresponds to a single data point.

Note: The third modification assumes that the `predict` method does not exist in the original `GaussianMixture` class and adds it to provide a complete solution for the issue. If the method already exists with similar functionality, this modification might need adjustment to ensure it aligns with the existing implementation.
