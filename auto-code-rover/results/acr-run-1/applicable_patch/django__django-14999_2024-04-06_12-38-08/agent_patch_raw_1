Given the context and the issue described, the core of the problem seems to be that a `RenameModel` operation does not consider whether a `db_table` attribute is explicitly defined for the model, which should ideally make the operation a no-op in terms of database schema changes. The `RenameModel` operation's `reduce` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is a key area to introduce a check for this condition. However, without direct access to model fields or options in the `reduce` method and considering the structure of Django's migration framework, a comprehensive solution might involve ensuring that the migration autodetector does not generate a `RenameModel` operation when the model's `db_table` is explicitly set and remains unchanged.

Since the detailed implementation of such a check might require a deeper integration with Django's migration framework than can be provided in this format, and given no direct evidence of a method to access model's `db_table` from within a `RenameModel` operation's `reduce` method, I'll outline a conceptual patch that could guide the development of a more detailed solution.

```python
<file>django/db/migrations/operations/models.py</file>
<original>def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if (isinstance(operation, RenameModel) and
                self.new_name_lower == operation.old_name_lower):
            return [
                RenameModel(
                    self.old_name,
                    operation.new_name,
                ),
            ]
        # Skip `ModelOperation.reduce` as we want to run `references_model`
        # against self.new_name.
        return (
            super(ModelOperation, self).reduce(operation, app_label) or
            not operation.references_model(self.new_name, app_label)
        )</original>
<patched>def reduce(self, operation, app_label, in_memory_state):
        if (isinstance(operation, RenameModel) and
                self.new_name_lower == operation.old_name_lower):
            # Retrieve the model state for the current app and model.
            model_state = in_memory_state.models.get((app_label, self.new_name_lower), None)
            if model_state and model_state.options.get('db_table'):
                # If `db_table` is explicitly set, consider this operation as no-op.
                return []
            return [
                RenameModel(
                    self.old_name,
                    operation.new_name,
                ),
            ]
        # Skip `ModelOperation.reduce` as we want to run `references_model`
        # against self.new_name.
        return (
            super(ModelOperation, self).reduce(operation, app_label, in_memory_state) or
            not operation.references_model(self.new_name, app_label, in_memory_state)
        )</patched>
```

**Note**: This patch is conceptual and assumes the existence of an `in_memory_state` parameter passed to the `reduce` method, which represents the current state of the models in memory during the migration planning phase. This parameter does not exist in the current Django migrations framework and would require significant modifications to the framework to support. The idea is to use the in-memory state of the models to check if the `db_table` option is set for the model being renamed and, if so, treat the `RenameModel` operation as a no-op to avoid unnecessary database schema changes.

Implementing this solution would require a deeper integration with the Django migrations framework, including changes to how operations are reduced and how the in-memory state of models is passed and managed throughout the migration planning and execution process.
