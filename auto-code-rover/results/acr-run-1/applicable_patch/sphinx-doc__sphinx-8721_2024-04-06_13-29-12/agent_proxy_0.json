            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more information about how the `viewcode` extension interacts with the build process for different output formats, specifically `html` and `epub`. The issue mentions that `viewcode` creates pages for `epub` even when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. This suggests that there might be a conditional check related to `viewcode_enable_epub` that is not functioning as expected or is missing in the code handling the `epub` build process.\n\nGiven this context, the following API calls would be useful to gather more information:\n\n1. **Search for the `viewcode` extension configuration**: This will help us understand how the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration is defined and potentially used in the codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"viewcode_enable_epub\")`\n\n2. **Search for the method handling the `epub` build process**: Since the issue occurs during the `epub` build process, identifying the method(s) responsible for this process could provide insights into where the conditional check for `viewcode_enable_epub` should be implemented or is failing.\n   - `search_method(\"make_epub\")`\n\n3. **Search for the method or code snippet that generates pages for `viewcode`**: Understanding how and where `viewcode` pages are generated will be crucial to identifying why they are being created for `epub` against the expected behavior.\n   - `search_code(\"viewcode page generation\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate the relevant sections of the codebase where the issue might originate, allowing for a more targeted investigation and subsequent patch development."
