Based on the provided context and the issue described, it seems that the logic to prevent viewcode page generation for `epub` when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False` is correctly placed but might not be effectively preventing the generation of these pages during the `epub` build process. Since the search results and the provided code snippets do not indicate an obvious flaw in the logic, the issue might be more subtle, possibly related to how the `doctree_read` event is handled or a misunderstanding of how the configuration is supposed to work.

However, without clear evidence of a specific bug in the provided code snippets and without further context that points to a specific malfunction, proposing a precise patch is challenging. The logic in `doctree_read` that checks for `viewcode_enable_epub` and returns early if it's set to `False` for `epub` builds appears to be correct. Similarly, the `setup` method properly registers the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration value.

Given this, a hypothetical patch might involve adding additional logging or debugging information to help trace the execution flow and confirm whether the `viewcode_enable_epub` check is functioning as expected. This approach is more diagnostic than corrective but could be a necessary first step in identifying the root cause of the issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/viewcode.py</file>
<original>if app.builder.name.startswith("epub") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
        return</original>
<patched>if app.builder.name.startswith("epub"):
        if not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
            app.info('Skipping viewcode page generation for epub as viewcode_enable_epub is False')
            return
        else:
            app.info('Proceeding with viewcode page generation for epub as viewcode_enable_epub is True')</patched>
```

This modification adds logging to provide insight into whether the conditional check for `viewcode_enable_epub` is working as expected. This is a diagnostic step rather than a direct fix, as it's unclear from the provided context why the issue is occurring. Adding such logging could help developers or users trace the problem more effectively.

Please note, the actual implementation of logging (`app.info`) might differ based on the Sphinx logging API available in the version being patched. Adjust the logging method (`app.info`) as necessary to match the Sphinx API.
