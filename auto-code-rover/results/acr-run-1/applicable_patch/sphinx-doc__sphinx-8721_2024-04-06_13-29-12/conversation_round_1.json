The issue mentions that `viewcode` creates pages for `epub` even when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. This suggests that there might be a conditional check related to `viewcode_enable_epub` that is not functioning as expected or is missing in the code handling the `epub` build process.\n\nGiven this context, the following API calls would be useful to gather more information:\n\n1. **Search for the `viewcode` extension configuration**: This will help us understand how the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration is defined and potentially used in the codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"viewcode_enable_epub\")`\n\n2. **Search for the method handling the `epub` build process**: Since the issue occurs during the `epub` build process, identifying the method(s) responsible for this process could provide insights into where the conditional check for `viewcode_enable_epub` should be implemented or is failing.\n   - `search_method(\"make_epub\")`\n\n3. **Search for the method or code snippet that generates pages for `viewcode`**: Understanding how and where `viewcode` pages are generated will be crucial to identifying why they are being created for `epub` against the expected behavior.\n   - `search_code(\"viewcode page generation\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate the relevant sections of the codebase where the issue might originate, allowing for a more targeted investigation and subsequent patch development."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some valuable insights into how the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration is handled within the Sphinx project, specifically within the `viewcode` extension. Let's break down the findings:\n\n1. **Handling of `viewcode_enable_epub` in `viewcode.py`**:\n   - The `doctree_read` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` checks the builder's name to determine if the current build process is for `epub`. If the builder's name starts with \"epub\" and `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`, the function returns early, effectively skipping the rest of its execution for `epub` builds. This is likely intended to prevent the generation of viewcode pages for `epub` when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.\n   - The `setup` function in the same file registers `viewcode_enable_epub` as a configuration value for the Sphinx application, with a default value of `False`. This setup is crucial for allowing users to enable or disable viewcode page generation for `epub` through their project's configuration.\n\n2. **Testing of `viewcode_enable_epub`**:\n   - A test case in `tests/test_ext_viewcode.py` specifically tests the behavior of `viewcode` when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `True`. This indicates that there is an expectation for this configuration to control the generation of viewcode pages in `epub` format, and that its functionality is considered important enough to be covered by automated tests.\n\nGiven these insights, the issue seems to stem from a discrepancy between the expected behavior (viewcode pages not being generated for `epub` when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`) and the actual behavior reported in the issue. The code snippets indicate that there is logic in place intended to prevent viewcode page generation for `epub` under the specified conditions, but for some reason, this logic is not functioning as expected in practice.\n\nThe absence of a method named `make_epub` and specific code snippets related to \"viewcode page generation\" suggests that the generation of viewcode pages might be handled more generically, without a dedicated method for `epub` or explicit references to page generation that we could identify with the provided search terms.\n\nTo move forward, we need to investigate why the conditional logic in `doctree_read` is not effectively preventing the generation of viewcode pages for `epub` despite seemingly being correctly set up to do so. This might involve a deeper dive into how the `doctree_read` function interacts with the rest of the Sphinx build process for `epub` formats and whether any other parts of the codebase might be influencing this behavior."
