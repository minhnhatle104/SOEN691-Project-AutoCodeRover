        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some valuable context to analyze the issue:\n\n1. **`method_decorator` Implementation**:\n   - Located in `django/utils/decorators.py`.\n   - Designed to convert a function decorator into a method decorator.\n   - It checks if the object passed is a class or a function. If it's a class, it requires a `name` argument to identify the method to be decorated.\n   - It uses `_multi_decorate` for the actual decoration process and `update_wrapper` to update wrapper attributes.\n   - The decorator's name is modified for debugging purposes.\n\n2. **`logger` Method**:\n   - The search did not find a method named `logger` in the codebase. This suggests that the `logger` function might be defined locally within a file or dynamically generated, making it harder to locate without more specific context.\n\n3. **`Test` Class**:\n   - There are multiple classes named `Test` across different test files in the codebase. Without more specific information, it's challenging to pinpoint which `Test` class the issue refers to. However, the presence of multiple `Test` classes in `tests/decorators/tests.py` and other test-related files suggests that the issue might be related to testing decorators or similar functionalities.\n\nGiven this context, the core of the issue seems to revolve around the `method_decorator` function's inability to handle partial objects correctly, which do not have function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. The absence of the `logger` method in the search results indicates that we might need to focus on how `method_decorator` is designed to work with function decorators and how it could be enhanced to handle partial objects or ensure that wrapper assignments are preserved.\n\nA potential approach to solving this issue could involve modifying the `method_decorator` function to better handle partial objects, possibly by checking if the object is a partial and then appropriately handling its attributes. However, without specific details on how `logger` is implemented or how it's supposed to interact with `method_decorator`, any solution would need to be general enough to handle similar cases where function attributes are missing from the object being decorated."

Since the `logger` method was not found in the codebase, it's challenging to understand exactly how it interacts with `method_decorator` and why it leads to the AttributeError. A more detailed understanding of how `logger` is supposed to work or its implementation details could be crucial. However, without a direct reference to it in the codebase, it's difficult to construct a specific API call without additional information. If `logger` is defined within a specific test file or is part of external libraries or dynamically generated, we might need direct access to those parts of the code or further descriptions.\n    \n- **where are bug locations**:\n    - **Buggy File**: `django/utils/decorators.py`\n    - **Buggy Method**: `method_decorator`\n\nThe analysis points to the `method_decorator` function in `django/utils/decorators.py` as the location where the issue arises. The problem seems to be related to how `method_decorator` handles objects that do not have the typical attributes of a function, such as `__name__` and `__module__`, which are missing in partial objects. The solution would likely involve modifying `method_decorator` to either correctly handle partial objects or ensure that the necessary attributes are preserved or appropriately emulated."
