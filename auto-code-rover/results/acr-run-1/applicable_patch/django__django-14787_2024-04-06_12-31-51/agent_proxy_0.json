Additionally, understanding the `logger` decorator and the `Test` class might provide insights into how decorators are generally used within this codebase. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"method_decorator\")`: This will help understand how `method_decorator` is implemented and might give clues on why it doesn't preserve wrapper assignments like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc.\n\n2. `search_method(\"logger\")`: Since the issue arises when using the `logger` decorator, understanding its implementation might reveal why it's not compatible with `method_decorator` or partial objects.\n\n3. `search_class(\"Test\")`: To see how the `Test` class is defined and how methods within it are being decorated. This could provide context on the usage pattern and potential areas of conflict with the `method_decorator`.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the issue and how they interact with each other."
