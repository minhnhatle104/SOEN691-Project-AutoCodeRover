Specifically, we should look into the `Point2D` class and the `evaluate` context manager to understand how they are supposed to work and where the issue might be arising from. Additionally, understanding how `sympify` is implemented could provide insights into why the error occurs when `evaluate(False)` is used.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `Point2D` class and the `evaluate` context manager to get an overview of their implementations and usage within the codebase. We will also look into the `sympify` function, as it is directly involved in the error.\n\n1. `search_class(\"Point2D\")`: This will help us understand the implementation details of the `Point2D` class, including its constructor and any relevant methods that might be involved in the issue.\n2. `search_method(\"evaluate\")`: Since `evaluate` is used as a context manager here, we need to find its implementation to understand how it affects the evaluation of expressions and why it might be causing an issue with `Point2D`.\n3. `search_method(\"sympify\")`: This will provide insights into how expressions are parsed and evaluated, which is crucial for understanding the root cause of the error message.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point for diagnosing the problem and formulating a solution."
