In the following,\n    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n    interpreted as the :class:`~.Order` object (used with series) and it raises\n    an error when used improperly:\n\n    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    bitcount(42)\n    >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\n    O(x)\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    TypeError: unbound method...\n\n    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\n    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n\n    >>> ns = {}\n    >>> exec('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)\n    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n    6\n\n    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\n    >>> exec('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: ``_clash1`` (single-letter variables),\n    ``_clash2`` (the multi-letter Greek names) or ``_clash`` (both single and\n    multi-letter names that are defined in ``abc``).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> set(_clash1)\n    {'E', 'I', 'N', 'O', 'Q', 'S'}\n    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted.

Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If\n    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated\n    before being passed to sympify, so adding ``evaluate=False`` will still\n    return the evaluated result of expression.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=True)\n    9\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=False)\n    4/2 + 7\n    >>> sympify(4/2+7, evaluate=False)\n    9.00000000000000\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    convert_xor\n    -----------\n\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n    x**y\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n    x ^ y\n\n    rational\n    --------\n\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n    0.1\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n    1/10\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    $-1$ by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    a :\n        - any object defined in SymPy\n        - standard numeric Python types: ``int``, ``long``, ``float``, ``Decimal``\n        - strings (like ``\"0.09\"``, ``\"2e-19\"`` or ``'sin(x)'``)\n        - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)\n        - dicts, lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above\n\n    convert_xor : bool, optional\n        If true, treats ``^`` as exponentiation.\n        If False, treats ``^`` as XOR itself.\n        Used only when input is a string.\n\n    locals : any object defined in SymPy, optional\n        In order to have strings be recognized it can be imported\n        into a namespace dictionary and passed as locals.\n\n    strict : bool, optional\n        If the option strict is set to ``True``, only the types for which\n        an explicit conversion has been defined are converted.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `Point2D` class, the `evaluate` context manager, and the `sympify` function, we can start to piece together what might be causing the issue reported.\n\n### Point2D Class\nThe `Point2D` class is a subclass of `Point` with an ambient dimension of 2, meaning it is intended to represent points in a two-dimensional space. The constructor (`__new__` method) allows for creating instances of `Point2D` with specific coordinates. The error message \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.\" suggests that the issue arises when the constructor is somehow passed an argument that leads it to believe imaginary coordinates are being used, which is not allowed.\n\n### evaluate Context Manager\nThe `evaluate` context manager from `sympy/core/parameters.py` is designed to control whether SymPy functions evaluate by default. When used with `evaluate(False)`, it should prevent automatic evaluation of expressions. This is intended for cases where one might want to keep expressions in their unevaluated form. The context manager works by setting a global parameter `global_parameters.evaluate` to the desired state (`True` or `False`) and then restoring it to its original state afterward.\n\n### sympify Function\nThe `sympify` function converts Python objects to SymPy objects, allowing for symbolic computation. It has an `evaluate` parameter that, when set to `False`, should prevent the automatic evaluation of expressions during the conversion process. This function is crucial in understanding the issue because it's directly involved in the error traceback and is responsible for parsing and converting the string representation of `Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))` into a SymPy object.\n\n### Analysis\nGiven the error occurs when `with evaluate(False)` is used, but not when `evaluate=False` is directly passed to `sympify` or omitted, the issue likely lies in how the `evaluate` context manager interacts with the creation of `Point2D` objects, particularly in the parsing and conversion process handled by `sympify`.\n\nThe error suggests that during the parsing or conversion process, when automatic evaluation is turned off globally by the `evaluate` context manager, the coordinates are somehow being misinterpreted or mishandled, leading to the mistaken belief that they are imaginary or otherwise invalid.\n\nThe next step in solving this issue would involve looking more closely at how `Point2D` objects are instantiated within the `sympify` process when global evaluation is disabled, and how the arguments (coordinates) are processed and validated in this context. A patch might involve ensuring that the `evaluate` context manager does not interfere with the proper handling of numeric arguments for geometric objects like `Point2D`."
