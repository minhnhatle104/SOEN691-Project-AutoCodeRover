Given the context and the nature of the issue, a hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that the `evaluate` parameter is correctly handled within the `sympify` function and that the instantiation of `Point2D` objects respects the global evaluation state. However, without specific details on the root cause of the issue, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate how one might address potential problems in the interaction between evaluation control and geometric object instantiation.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/sympify.py</file>
<original>
if evaluate is None:
    evaluate = global_parameters.evaluate
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure that the evaluate parameter explicitly passed to sympify takes precedence
# over the global evaluation state, providing more predictable control over evaluation.
if evaluate is None:
    evaluate = global_parameters.evaluate
else:
    global_parameters.evaluate = evaluate
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/geometry/point.py</file>
<original>
if evaluate:
    coords = coords.xreplace({
        f: simplify(nsimplify(f, rational=True))
         for f in coords.atoms(Float)})
</original>
<patched>
# Adjust the condition to explicitly check the global evaluation state
# This ensures that the coordinates are simplified based on the current evaluation context
if evaluate and global_parameters.evaluate:
    coords = coords.xreplace({
        f: simplify(nsimplify(f, rational=True))
         for f in coords.atoms(Float)})
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/core/parameters.py</file>
<original>
try:
    global_parameters.evaluate = x
    yield
finally:
    global_parameters.evaluate = old
</original>
<patched>
# Add a mechanism to ensure that the evaluate context manager does not override
# the evaluation state if it has been explicitly set within the context
try:
    if not hasattr(global_parameters, '_explicit_evaluate'):
        global_parameters.evaluate = x
    yield
finally:
    if not hasattr(global_parameters, '_explicit_evaluate'):
        global_parameters.evaluate = old
    if hasattr(global_parameters, '_explicit_evaluate'):
        delattr(global_parameters, '_explicit_evaluate')
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are speculative and aim to illustrate potential approaches to resolving the issue based on the provided context. Actual implementation may require a deeper understanding of the issue and testing to ensure the changes address the problem without introducing new issues.
