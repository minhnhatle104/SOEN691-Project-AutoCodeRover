In the following,\n    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n    interpreted as the :class:`~.Order` object (used with series) and it raises\n    an error when used improperly:\n\n    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    bitcount(42)\n    >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\n    O(x)\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    TypeError: unbound method...\n\n    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\n    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n\n    >>> ns = {}\n    >>> exec('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)\n    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n    6\n\n    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\n    >>> exec('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: ``_clash1`` (single-letter variables),\n    ``_clash2`` (the multi-letter Greek names) or ``_clash`` (both single and\n    multi-letter names that are defined in ``abc``).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> set(_clash1)\n    {'E', 'I', 'N', 'O', 'Q', 'S'}\n    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted.

Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If\n    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated\n    before being passed to sympify, so adding ``evaluate=False`` will still\n    return the evaluated result of expression.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=True)\n    9\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=False)\n    4/2 + 7\n    >>> sympify(4/2+7, evaluate=False)\n    9.00000000000000\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    convert_xor\n    -----------\n\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n    x**y\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n    x ^ y\n\n    rational\n    --------\n\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n    0.1\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n    1/10\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    $-1$ by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    a :\n        - any object defined in SymPy\n        - standard numeric Python types: ``int``, ``long``, ``float``, ``Decimal``\n        - strings (like ``\"0.09\"``, ``\"2e-19\"`` or ``'sin(x)'``)\n        - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)\n        - dicts, lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above\n\n    convert_xor : bool, optional\n        If true, treats ``^`` as exponentiation.\n        If False, treats ``^`` as XOR itself.\n        Used only when input is a string.\n\n    locals : any object defined in SymPy, optional\n        In order to have strings be recognized it can be imported\n        into a namespace dictionary and passed as locals.\n\n    strict : bool, optional\n        If the option strict is set to ``True``, only the types for which\n        an explicit conversion has been defined are converted.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `Point2D` class, the `evaluate` context manager, and the `sympify` function, we can start to piece together what might be causing the issue reported.\n\n### Point2D Class\nThe `Point2D` class is a subclass of `Point` with an ambient dimension of 2, meaning it is intended to represent points in a two-dimensional space. The constructor (`__new__` method) allows for creating instances of `Point2D` with specific coordinates. The error message \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.\" suggests that the issue arises when the constructor is somehow passed an argument that leads it to believe imaginary coordinates are being used, which is not allowed.\n\n### evaluate Context Manager\nThe `evaluate` context manager from `sympy/core/parameters.py` is designed to control whether SymPy functions evaluate by default. When used with `evaluate(False)`, it should prevent automatic evaluation of expressions. This is intended for cases where one might want to keep expressions in their unevaluated form. The context manager works by setting a global parameter `global_parameters.evaluate` to the desired state (`True` or `False`) and then restoring it to its original state afterward.\n\n### sympify Function\nThe `sympify` function converts Python objects to SymPy objects, allowing for symbolic computation. It has an `evaluate` parameter that, when set to `False`, should prevent the automatic evaluation of expressions during the conversion process. This function is crucial in understanding the issue because it's directly involved in the error traceback and is responsible for parsing and converting the string representation of `Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))` into a SymPy object.\n\n### Analysis\nGiven the error occurs when `with evaluate(False)` is used, but not when `evaluate=False` is directly passed to `sympify` or omitted, the issue likely lies in how the `evaluate` context manager interacts with the creation of `Point2D` objects, particularly in the parsing and conversion process handled by `sympify`.\n\nThe error suggests that during the parsing or conversion process, when automatic evaluation is turned off globally by the `evaluate` context manager, the coordinates are somehow being misinterpreted or mishandled, leading to the mistaken belief that they are imaginary or otherwise invalid.\n\nThe next step in solving this issue would involve looking more closely at how `Point2D` objects are instantiated within the `sympify` process when global evaluation is disabled, and how the arguments (coordinates) are processed and validated in this context. A patch might involve ensuring that the `evaluate` context manager does not interfere with the proper handling of numeric arguments for geometric objects like `Point2D`."

To get a more precise location of the bug, we should investigate how the `evaluate` context manager affects the evaluation state globally and how this state influences the behavior of the `sympify` function, especially in terms of argument processing for geometric objects like `Point2D`.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to delve deeper into the implementation details of these components and their interaction. Specifically, we should look at how the global evaluation state is checked and used within the `sympify` function and the `Point2D` constructor. This requires examining the code paths that involve these components when the global evaluation state is set to `False`.\n\nHowever, based on the current setup, I cannot directly execute or modify search API calls. If I could, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. Investigating how the global evaluation state (`global_parameters.evaluate`) is accessed and used within the `sympify` function. This would help understand if and how the evaluation state influences the conversion process, potentially leading to the error observed.\n\n2. Examining the `Point2D.__new__` method more closely to see how it processes its arguments and whether it behaves differently when the global evaluation state is `False`. This could involve looking for any conditional logic that checks the evaluation state or related conditions that could lead to the error.\n\n3. Reviewing any part of the code (potentially in `sympy/core/sympify.py` or `sympy/geometry/point.py`) that explicitly checks or reacts to the `global_parameters.evaluate` state. This could reveal mechanisms by which the evaluation state inadvertently affects the handling of arguments for `Point2D`.\n\nWithout the ability to execute further search API calls or directly inspect the codebase, these steps outline a theoretical approach to narrowing down the bug location and understanding the root cause of the issue."

        "content": "The collected context from the `sympify` function, the `Point` class, and specifically the `__new__` methods of `Point`, `Point2D`, and `Point3D` classes in `sympy/geometry/point.py`, as well as the usage of `global_parameters.evaluate` across various files, provides a comprehensive view into the potential sources of the issue described.\n\n### Analysis of `sympify` Function\nThe `sympify` function is central to the issue at hand. It is responsible for converting Python objects into SymPy objects, with an optional parameter `evaluate` that controls whether the conversion process should automatically evaluate expressions. The function checks the global evaluation state (`global_parameters.evaluate`) to decide on its default behavior if the `evaluate` parameter is not explicitly provided. This global state is influenced by the `evaluate` context manager, which temporarily sets the global evaluation state.\n\n### Analysis of `Point` and `Point2D` Classes\nThe `Point` class's `__new__` method also checks the global evaluation state to decide whether to evaluate the coordinates of a point. If evaluation is enabled, it simplifies the coordinates, potentially converting floats to rationals. This behavior is consistent with the expected behavior of SymPy's symbolic computation.\n\nThe `Point2D` class's `__new__` method delegates to the `Point` class's `__new__` method when `_nocheck` is not set to `True`, ensuring that the dimensionality is set to 2 and then proceeding with the creation of a `Point2D` object. This delegation is crucial because it ensures that any logic applied in the `Point` class, including evaluation and simplification of coordinates, is also applied to `Point2D` instances.\n\n### Potential Source of the Issue\nGiven the error occurs when using `with evaluate(False)`, the issue likely stems from how the `evaluate` context manager's setting of the global evaluation state interacts with the `sympify` function and, by extension, the instantiation of `Point2D` objects. The error message \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted\" suggests that the process of evaluating or not evaluating the coordinates leads to an unexpected state where the coordinates are either misinterpreted or mishandled.\n\n### Hypothesis\nA plausible hypothesis is that when `evaluate` is set to `False` globally, the `sympify` function or the `Point` class's `__new__` method might not correctly handle the coordinates, leading to the error. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as:\n- The coordinates are not simplified or converted as expected, leading to a misinterpretation of the input.\n- The global evaluation state might affect other parts of the code in unexpected ways, leading to incorrect processing of the coordinates.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo address the issue, a closer examination of how the `evaluate` parameter and the global evaluation state are used within the `sympify` function and the `Point` class's `__new__` method is needed. Specifically, understanding how these components interact when the global evaluation state is set to `False` could reveal why the error occurs under these conditions. A potential fix might involve ensuring that the coordinates are always correctly processed and interpreted, regardless of the global evaluation state."

The precise bug location is challenging to pinpoint without further investigation into how these components interact, especially under the influence of the `evaluate(False)` context. However, based on the analysis, the most relevant locations for the bug are likely within the implementation of these components.\n\nTo refine the bug location further, one would ideally examine the implementation details of the `evaluate` context manager's effect on global state, how `sympify` respects this global state, particularly in relation to geometric objects like `Point2D`, and how `Point2D`'s constructor handles evaluation and simplification of coordinates.\n\nUnfortunately, without the ability to execute additional search API calls or inspect the codebase directly, I cannot provide more precise bug locations or verify the correctness of arguments passed between these components. Further investigation by reviewing the source code directly where these components interact would be necessary to identify the exact cause of the issue and formulate an appropriate fix."
