Specifically, I will search for the `Point` class and the `vel` method within it, as well as the `ReferenceFrame` class to understand how orientations and velocities are currently being handled. Additionally, I will look into how the `set_pos` method is implemented for the `Point` class since it's directly related to setting positions which might give insights into why velocities are not automatically calculated.\n\nHere are the API calls I will make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Point\")` - To get an overview of the `Point` class and any relevant documentation or comments that might hint at why velocity calculation is not implemented.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"vel\", \"Point\")` - To examine the implementation of the `vel` method in the `Point` class to understand its current limitations.\n3. `search_class(\"ReferenceFrame\")` - To understand how orientations and angular velocities are handled, which might provide insights into how to implement a similar mechanism for linear velocities.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"set_pos\", \"Point\")` - To see how positions are set between points and if there's a mechanism that could be extended or adapted for velocity calculation."
