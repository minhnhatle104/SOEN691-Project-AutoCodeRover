This modification attempts to calculate the velocity of a point in a given reference frame dynamically if it has not been explicitly defined. It iterates through the `_pos_dict` of the point, which contains position vectors relative to other points, and checks if the time derivative of any of these position vectors in the specified frame is non-zero. If a non-zero derivative is found, it sets this derivative as the velocity of the point in the frame and returns it. If no such derivative can be calculated, it raises the original `ValueError`. This approach assumes that `pos_vector.dt(frame)` correctly calculates the time derivative of the position vector in the given frame, and that `Vector(0)` represents a zero vector in the system.
