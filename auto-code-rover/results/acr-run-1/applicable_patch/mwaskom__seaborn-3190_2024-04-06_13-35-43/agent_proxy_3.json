            "content": "I understand the need for more precise identification of the bug locations. However, based on the information provided and the constraints of our interaction, I've identified the most relevant parts of the code that are directly involved in the issue as described. The analysis points to a problem with handling boolean data in the context of setting up scales for plotting, specifically within the seaborn library's `ContinuousBase._setup` method and the process that leads to it in `Plotter._setup_scales`.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information available from the search results, further refinement in identifying the bug locations would require additional context or access to the codebase that isn't directly available through our current interaction mode.\n\nTo proceed with addressing the issue based on the current understanding, the recommended approach involves:\n\n1. **Reviewing the handling of boolean data in scale setup**: This involves examining how boolean values are passed to and processed by the `ContinuousBase._setup` method. The error suggests that boolean values are not expected in this context, indicating a need for either converting these values to a numerical scale or implementing a check to handle boolean data differently.\n\n2. **Implementing a fix in the identified methods**: Based on the analysis, the fix would likely involve modifying the `ContinuousBase._setup` method to handle boolean data appropriately or adjusting the `Plotter._setup_scales` method to convert boolean values to a format compatible with the continuous scale setup.\n\nWithout the ability to perform additional searches or directly access more detailed information from the codebase, the next steps would involve manually reviewing the identified methods and implementing a solution that addresses the handling of boolean data in the context of scale setup for plotting."
