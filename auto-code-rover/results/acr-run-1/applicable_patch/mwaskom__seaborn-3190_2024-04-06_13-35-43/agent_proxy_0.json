            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the color mapping is handled within the seaborn library, specifically within the context of boolean data. The traceback points to a problem in the `_setup_scales` method of the `Plotter` class and the `_setup` method of the `ContinuousBase` scale class. Let's gather more information about these components and the related code paths.\n\nGiven the information from the issue, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"Plot._plot\", \"Plot\")` - To understand how plotting is initiated and how it leads to the error.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_setup_scales\", \"Plotter\")` - To get more context on how scales are set up for different types of data.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_setup\", \"ContinuousBase\")` - To understand how continuous scales are specifically handled, which seems to be where the error occurs with boolean data.\n4. `search_code(\"self._scales[var] = scale._setup(var_df[var], prop)\")` - To find where scales are being setup and potentially mishandling boolean data.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of the code paths involved in the issue, allowing for a targeted approach to patching the bug."
