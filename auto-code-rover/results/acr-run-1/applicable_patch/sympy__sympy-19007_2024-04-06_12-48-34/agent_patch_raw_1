This patch modifies the `_entry` method in the `BlockMatrix` class to handle symbolic indices more gracefully. Instead of immediately breaking the loop when encountering a symbolic index (which could potentially belong to any block), it now assigns the current block to the symbolic index and continues. This approach aims to address the issue where the method incorrectly simplifies `C[i, 0]` to `(A)[i, 0]` by ensuring that symbolic indices are considered more carefully. Additionally, it adds a check to raise an `IndexError` if the calculated block indices are out of range, improving the method's robustness.
