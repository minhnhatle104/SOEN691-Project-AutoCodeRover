Given the context and the nature of the issue, a precise patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of Django's migration system and the specific conditions that lead to the error. However, I can propose a general direction for a patch based on the information provided.

The error message `the "." operator prohibited in index expressions` suggests that there's an issue with how expressions involving columns are being handled, particularly in the context of unique constraints during the `_remake_table` process. This could be related to the way column names or expressions are quoted or referenced in the SQL statement generated for copying data from the old table to the new table or when recreating constraints.

A potential patch might involve ensuring that column references in expressions related to unique constraints are correctly formatted and do not use operators or syntax that SQLite does not support in the context where they are used. However, without a specific line or expression that causes the error, this is speculative.

Here's a speculative patch that aims to ensure expressions in the mapping for the `INSERT INTO` operation are correctly handled. This is purely illustrative:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py</file>
<original>self.execute("INSERT INTO %s (%s) SELECT %s FROM %s" % (
    self.quote_name(new_model._meta.db_table),
    ', '.join(self.quote_name(x) for x in mapping),
    ', '.join(mapping.values()),
    self.quote_name(model._meta.db_table),
))</original>
<patched>self.execute("INSERT INTO %s (%s) SELECT %s FROM %s" % (
    self.quote_name(new_model._meta.db_table),
    ', '.join(self.quote_name(x) for x in mapping.keys()),
    ', '.join(mapping.values()),
    self.quote_name(model._meta.db_table),
))</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the `INSERT INTO` statement uses the keys from the `mapping` dictionary for the column names in the SQL statement, which should already be the case. The speculative nature of this patch means it might not address the specific cause of the error if the issue lies elsewhere, such as in the generation of the `mapping` dictionary values or how unique constraints are handled during the table remake process.

For a real-world solution, one would need to debug the migration process, identify the exact SQL statement causing the error, and understand how Django's SQLite backend constructs expressions for unique constraints during schema alterations. This would likely involve adding logging or breakpoints in the `_remake_table` method and closely examining the values of variables like `mapping` and `constraints` to see how they are constructed and used.
