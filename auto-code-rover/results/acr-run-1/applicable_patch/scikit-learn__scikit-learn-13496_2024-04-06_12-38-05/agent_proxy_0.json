Specifically, we need to understand how `warm_start` is implemented in similar classes like `RandomForestClassifier` for consistency. Here are the API calls that would be helpful:\n\n1. Search for the `IsolationForest` class to understand its current implementation and to see if `warm_start` is mentioned or used indirectly.\n2. Search for the `BaseBagging` class to understand how `warm_start` is implemented or documented there, since `IsolationForest` inherits from it.\n3. Search for the `RandomForestClassifier` class to see how `warm_start` is exposed and documented, as the issue suggests doing something similar for `IsolationForest`.\n4. Search for any existing tests related to `warm_start` in `IsolationForest` or a similar mechanism in other classes to guide the creation of a new test.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"IsolationForest\")`\n2. `search_class(\"BaseBagging\")`\n3. `search_class(\"RandomForestClassifier\")`\n4. `search_method(\"test_warm_start\")`"
