Note: Modifications 2 and 3 are essentially no-ops, included for completeness. The critical change is in modification 1, where `.copy()` is added to ensure that a new dictionary is yielded each time, thus preventing the issue where the same dictionary object is reused. This change should resolve the issue without significantly impacting performance, as the cost of copying a dictionary is relatively low compared to the potential confusion and bugs caused by reusing the same dictionary object.
