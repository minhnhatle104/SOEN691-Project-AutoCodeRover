Specifically, we need to understand the mechanism that leads to a chunked `DataArray` being eagerly evaluated and losing its chunked nature upon updating the dataset. \n\nGiven the information in the issue, the following API calls would be necessary to get more context and potentially identify the source of the problem:\n\n1. Search for the `DataSet` class to understand its structure and methods:\n   - `search_class(\"DataSet\")`\n\n2. Search for the `update` method within the `DataSet` class to see how it is implemented and how it handles `DataArray` objects:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"update\", \"DataSet\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the creation of a `Dataset` with a `DataArray` and dimension names causing computation of the variable, it would be useful to also look into the `Dataset` constructor to see if there's any relevant handling there:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"DataSet\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and formulating a solution."
