<patched>            elif e == -1 and b.is_zero:
                return S.ComplexInfinity
            elif b.is_zero and e.is_negative and e.is_infinite:
                return S.ComplexInfinity</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by explicitly checking if the base `b` is zero and the exponent `e` is both negative and infinite, which matches the condition for `0**-oo`. The original condition `not b` is replaced with `b.is_zero` for clarity and to ensure that the check is specifically for the base being zero. The added condition then correctly returns `ComplexInfinity` (`S.ComplexInfinity`) for the case of `0**-oo`.
