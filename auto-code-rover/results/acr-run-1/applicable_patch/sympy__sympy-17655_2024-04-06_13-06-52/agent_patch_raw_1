        >>> from sympy.geometry.point import Point

        When sequences of coordinates are passed to Point methods, they
        are converted to a Point internally. This __add__ method does
        not do that so if floating point values are used, a floating
        point result (in terms of SymPy Floats) will be returned.

        >>> Point(1, 2) + (.1, .2)
        Point2D(1.1, 2.2)

        If this is not desired, the `translate` method can be used or
        another Point can be added:

        >>> Point(1, 2).translate(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
        >>> Point(1, 2) + Point(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)

```

This patch adds a check at the beginning of the `__add__` method to return `NotImplemented` if the `other` operand is a `Mul` object containing a `Point`. This allows Python's method resolution order to attempt to call the `__radd__` method of the `Mul` object, if it exists, which may correctly handle the addition. This approach avoids modifying the behavior of existing operations while providing a way to handle the specific case described in the issue.
