```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>        method = builtin_str(method)</original>
<patched>        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('utf-8')
        else:
            method = builtin_str(method)</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by first checking if the `method` variable is an instance of `bytes`. If it is, it decodes the `method` using UTF-8 to convert it into a string. This approach ensures that binary strings (e.g., `b'GET'`) are correctly handled and converted into a regular string (`'GET'`) before proceeding with the request preparation. If the `method` is not a binary string, it falls back to the original behavior of using `builtin_str(method)` to ensure compatibility with other types or string representations. This patch aims to maintain compatibility across different Python versions and use cases within the `requests` library.
