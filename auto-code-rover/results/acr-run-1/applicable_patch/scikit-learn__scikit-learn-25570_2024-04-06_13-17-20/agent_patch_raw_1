# modification 2
```python

<original>elif _is_empty_column_selection(columns):
                    continue</original>
<patched># Adjusted to ensure transformers with no features are handled correctly
                # This change ensures that transformers with no features do not disrupt the flow
                elif _is_empty_column_selection(columns):
                    # Instead of continuing, we yield a placeholder with empty array to maintain the structure
                    yield (name, trans, np.array([]), get_weight(name))</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that transformers with no features do not cause errors when the output is set to "pandas". The first modification ensures that the column names are correctly set in the output DataFrame, even when `verbose_feature_names_out` is False or when there's a potential mismatch in the expected names due to transformers with no features. The second modification adjusts the `_iter` method to handle transformers with no features more gracefully, ensuring that the structure of the output is maintained without causing errors.
