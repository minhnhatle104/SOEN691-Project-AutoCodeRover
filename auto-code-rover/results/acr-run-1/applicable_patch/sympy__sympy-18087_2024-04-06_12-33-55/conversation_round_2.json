This function aims to reduce expressions by using known trig identities. It supports different methods for simplification, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. The default method is 'matching'.\n   - The function documentation provides examples of how `trigsimp` simplifies expressions and mentions that using `method=\"groebner\"` or `\"combined\"` might lead to greater simplification.\n   - The function uses a variety of sub-functions and methods to achieve simplification, including a special case for expressions that have their own `_eval_trigsimp` method.\n\n2. **`trigsimp` in Other Contexts:**\n   - The `trigsimp` method is also implemented in `sympy/vector/basisdependent.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`, indicating that the simplification functionality is integrated across different parts of the SymPy library. These implementations seem to delegate to the primary `trigsimp` function or adapt its functionality to specific contexts (e.g., vector components).\n\n3. **Search for Specific Expressions:**\n   - The search for the specific expression `cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2)` did not yield any results, suggesting that there might not be direct handling or test cases for this exact expression in the codebase.\n   - The search for `cos(x)+sin(x)` led to a snippet in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` within a function `L`, but the context provided is limited. It's unclear how this directly relates to the issue, but it indicates that expressions involving `cos` and `sin` are indeed manipulated in various parts of the library.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how `trigsimp` simplifies trigonometric expressions, particularly for complex numbers. The absence of direct handling or test cases for the expression `cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2)` might be a contributing factor. To address the issue, we may need to:\n\n- Review and potentially enhance the simplification logic in `trigsimp`, especially for complex numbers.\n- Consider adding handling or special cases for expressions like `cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2)` if they are not adequately covered by the current implementation.\n- Add test cases for such expressions to ensure correct simplification behavior across different scenarios, including for complex numbers.\n\nFurther steps could involve diving deeper into the specific methods (`'matching'`, `'groebner'`, `'combined'`, and `'fu'`) used by `trigsimp` to identify where the logic might be failing for the given expression."
