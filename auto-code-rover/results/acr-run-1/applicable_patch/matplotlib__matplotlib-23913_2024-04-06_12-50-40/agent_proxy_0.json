Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Legend\")`: This will help understand the structure of the `Legend` class, including its `__init__` method and any existing methods related to making the legend draggable.\n2. `search_method(\"draggable\")`: Since the issue mentions a desire to have a `draggable=True` keyword argument in the `Legend` class's `__init__` method, this search will help find where and how the draggable functionality is currently implemented across the codebase. It's possible that the draggable functionality is a method in the `Legend` class or elsewhere."
