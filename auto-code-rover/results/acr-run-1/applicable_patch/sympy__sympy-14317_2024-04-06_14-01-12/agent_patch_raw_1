<patched># Ensure consistent monomial ordering by default
if 'order' not in settings:
    settings['order'] = 'lex'
return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)</patched>
```

This patch ensures that if the `order` setting is not explicitly provided when calling the `latex` function, it defaults to `'lex'` (lexicographical order), which aligns with the logical order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees used by the `pretty` and `str` printers. This change aims to make the default behavior of the `latex` function consistent with the other printers, addressing the issue of inconsistent monomial ordering.
