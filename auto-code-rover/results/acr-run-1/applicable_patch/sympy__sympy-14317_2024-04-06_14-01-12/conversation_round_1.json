        "content": "Based on the search results, we have found the `Poly` class within the `sympy/polys/polytools.py` file, which provides a comprehensive overview of the methods and properties available for polynomial manipulation in SymPy. However, the specific methods for `latex`, `pretty`, and `__str__` were not found directly within the `Poly` class. This suggests that the functionality for converting a `Poly` object into its LaTeX, pretty, or string representation might be implemented elsewhere, possibly through a more generic mechanism that handles various types of SymPy objects, not just polynomials.\n\nGiven that the `latex`, `pretty`, and `__str__` methods are not directly part of the `Poly` class, there are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Inheritance**: The `Poly` class might inherit these methods from a parent class. However, without information on the parent classes from the search results, this path requires further investigation.\n\n2. **External Functions or Dispatch Mechanism**: SymPy often uses external functions or a dispatch mechanism for rendering objects in different formats. For example, there might be a separate function or system responsible for converting objects to LaTeX, which is called with a `Poly` object as an argument. This system might use a different ordering logic for monomials when rendering LaTeX compared to the logic used for `pretty` or `str` representations.\n\n3. **Visitor Pattern or Similar**: SymPy could employ a visitor pattern or a similar design pattern where objects like `Poly` are passed to a renderer that determines how to convert them into different formats. This would mean that the logic for rendering in LaTeX or other formats is encapsulated in the renderer rather than in the `Poly` class itself.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the next steps for resolving the issue would involve:\n\n- Investigating how SymPy generally handles conversions to LaTeX, pretty, and string formats for various objects. This might involve searching for functions or classes responsible for rendering or a dispatch system that manages these conversions.\n- Understanding the logic used for ordering monomials in these different formats and identifying where the discrepancy arises for the LaTeX representation.\n\nWithout direct access to the methods within the `Poly` class, we might need to look for external mechanisms or utilities in SymPy that handle these representations. This could involve searching for functions like `latex()`, `pretty()`, or utilities related to string representations that work with SymPy objects in general."
