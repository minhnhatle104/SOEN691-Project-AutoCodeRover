This patch assumes there's a relationship (like a ForeignKey or OneToOneField) from `Question` to `Choice` named `related_choice`. The method `display_choice` is added to `QuestionAdmin` to safely access the `choice` field from the related `Choice` model. This method is then included in `list_display` to display the choice in the admin list view. The actual relationship name (`related_choice` in this example) should be replaced with the correct field name that links `Question` to `Choice`. If the relationship is of a different nature (e.g., ManyToManyField or reverse ForeignKey), the method `display_choice` will need to be adapted accordingly.
