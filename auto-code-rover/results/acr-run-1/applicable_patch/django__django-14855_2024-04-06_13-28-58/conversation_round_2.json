(See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)\nI have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:\nurl = reverse(\nurl_name,\nargs=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\ncurrent_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n)\nHowever, I don't know if there are any side effects and I have not yet run the full suite of tests on this.

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered significant context regarding the issue and the proposed solution. Here's an analysis of the findings:\n\n1. **`get_admin_url` in `AdminReadonlyField`**:\n   - The method generates a URL for a ForeignKey field in the admin interface. The issue arises here because the URL is hardcoded to use the default admin site's URL pattern (`admin:`), which does not account for custom admin sites.\n   - The proposed solution modifies this method to include the `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name` argument in the `reverse` function call, aiming to generate the correct URL for custom admin sites.\n\n2. **Usage of `reverse` in `django.contrib.admin.helpers.py`**:\n   - The search results confirm that the `reverse` function is indeed used in the manner described in the issue, without considering the `current_app` parameter. This aligns with the problem statement provided.\n\n3. **`response_add` in `ModelAdmin`**:\n   - This method provides an example of correctly using the `current_app` parameter with the `reverse` function to generate URLs that respect the current admin site. It demonstrates a pattern of including the admin site's name (`self.admin_site.name`) as the `current_app` argument, which ensures that the generated URL is appropriate for the admin site being used.\n   - This pattern supports the proposed solution's approach, suggesting that including the `current_app` parameter is a consistent and established practice for handling similar situations within Django's admin framework.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe analysis indicates that the proposed solution is on the right track. By adding the `current_app` parameter to the `reverse` call in the `get_admin_url` method of the `AdminReadonlyField` class, we align with established patterns in Django's admin for handling custom admin site URLs. This change should allow the correct generation of URLs for ForeignKey fields in readonly mode within custom admin sites, addressing the reported issue.\n\nHowever, before finalizing the solution, it's crucial to consider potential side effects, especially regarding backward compatibility and the behavior in projects that use multiple admin sites. Testing the change across different configurations and use cases will be essential to ensure that it does not introduce new issues."
