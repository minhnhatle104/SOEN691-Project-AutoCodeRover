Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem lies in how the nested fractions are being converted into SymPy expressions, specifically in the handling of parentheses around the denominator in complex fractions. The provided code snippet does not directly show the implementation of `convert_relation`, which is likely where the logic for handling the conversion of parsed LaTeX fractions into SymPy expressions resides. However, based on the issue description and common practices in handling mathematical expressions, a general approach to patching this issue can be suggested.

Since the direct implementation details of `convert_relation` are not provided, I'll propose a conceptual patch that should be adapted to the specific implementation details of the `convert_relation` function or wherever the fraction conversion is handled.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py</file>
<original>expr = convert_relation(relation)</original>
<patched># Assuming convert_relation or a similar function is responsible for handling the conversion
# The patch should ensure that fractions, especially nested ones, are correctly handled.
# This is a conceptual patch and needs to be adapted to the actual implementation.

# Modify the convert_relation function or the relevant part of the code to ensure
# that nested fractions are enclosed in parentheses appropriately.

def convert_relation(relation):
    # Pseudocode for handling nested fractions
    # This should be adapted to the actual logic of convert_relation or wherever fractions are handled
    if isinstance(relation, Fraction):
        numerator = handle_relation(relation.numerator)
        denominator = handle_relation(relation.denominator)
        # Ensure parentheses around the denominator if it's a complex expression
        if isinstance(denominator, ComplexExpression):
            return f"({numerator})/({denominator})"
        else:
            return f"({numerator})/{denominator}"
    else:
        # Handle other types of relations
        pass

# Note: The actual implementation will depend on how the relations and expressions are represented
# and handled in the code. The key is to ensure that denominators of fractions, especially in nested fractions,
# are correctly enclosed in parentheses to maintain the correct mathematical precedence.
</patched>
```

This modification is conceptual and assumes that the handling of fractions and their conversion into SymPy expressions occurs in or around the `convert_relation` function. The actual implementation will depend on the specific details of how LaTeX expressions are parsed and converted in the codebase. The core idea is to ensure that when converting fractions, especially nested ones, the denominator is correctly enclosed in parentheses to maintain the proper mathematical precedence and representation.
