        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the classes and methods involved in the error. From the issue description and traceback, we can identify several key components that are likely related to the bug:\n\n1. The `LogNorm` class, which is being set as the new norm and seems to be at the center of the issue.\n2. The `update_scalarmappable` method in the `collections.py` file, which is part of the traceback and might be directly involved in handling the norm update.\n3. The `__call__` method in the `colors.py` file for the `LogNorm` class, as the error is raised during its execution indicating an invalid `vmin` or `vmax`.\n4. The `pcolormesh` method might also be relevant, as it is used to create the plot to which the `LogNorm` is applied.\n\nGiven these components, the following API calls would be useful to get more context and possibly identify the source of the bug:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LogNorm\")`: This will provide information on the `LogNorm` class, including its implementation and any recent changes that might have introduced the bug.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"update_scalarmappable\", \"matplotlib/collections.py\")`: Since the traceback points to this method as part of the error process, examining its code could reveal how it interacts with the norm and why it might fail with the new `LogNorm`.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__call__\", \"LogNorm\")`: This will help us understand the conditions under which the `ValueError` is raised for invalid `vmin` or `vmax` values.\n4. `search_method(\"pcolormesh\")`: Understanding how `pcolormesh` sets up the plot and interacts with the norm could provide insights into why changing the norm post-creation of the colorbar leads to an error.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."

If ``C[i, j]`` is masked, the corresponding\n        quadrilateral will be transparent. Masking of *X* and *Y* is not\n        supported. Use `~.Axes.pcolor` if you need this functionality.\n\n        .. _axes-pcolormesh-grid-orientation:\n\n        **Grid orientation**\n\n        The grid orientation follows the standard matrix convention: An array\n        *C* with shape (nrows, ncolumns) is plotted with the column number as\n        *X* and the row number as *Y*.\n\n        .. _differences-pcolor-pcolormesh:\n\n        **Differences between pcolor() and pcolormesh()**\n\n        Both methods are used to create a pseudocolor plot of a 2D array\n        using quadrilaterals.\n\n        The main difference lies in the created object and internal data\n        handling:\n        While `~.Axes.pcolor` returns a `.PolyCollection`, `~.Axes.pcolormesh`\n        returns a `.QuadMesh`. The latter is more specialized for the given\n        purpose and thus is faster. It should almost always be preferred.\n\n        There is also a slight difference in the handling of masked arrays.\n        Both `~.Axes.pcolor` and `~.Axes.pcolormesh` support masked arrays\n        for *C*. However, only `~.Axes.pcolor` supports masked arrays for *X*\n        and *Y*. The reason lies in the internal handling of the masked values.\n        `~.Axes.pcolor` leaves out the respective polygons from the\n        PolyCollection. `~.Axes.pcolormesh` sets the facecolor of the masked\n        elements to transparent. You can see the difference when using\n        edgecolors. While all edges are drawn irrespective of masking in a\n        QuadMesh, the edge between two adjacent masked quadrilaterals in\n        `~.Axes.pcolor` is not drawn as the corresponding polygons do not\n        exist in the PolyCollection.\n\n        Another difference is the support of Gouraud shading in\n        `~.Axes.pcolormesh`, which is not available with `~.Axes.pcolor`.\n\n        \"\"\"\n        if shading is None:\n            shading = mpl.rcParams['pcolor.shading']\n        shading = shading.lower()\n        kwargs.setdefault('edgecolors', 'none')\n\n        X, Y, C, shading = self._pcolorargs('pcolormesh', *args,\n                                            shading=shading, kwargs=kwargs)\n        coords = np.stack([X, Y], axis=-1)\n        # convert to one dimensional array, except for 3D RGB(A) arrays\n        if C.ndim != 3:\n            C = C.ravel()\n\n        kwargs.setdefault('snap', mpl.rcParams['pcolormesh.snap'])\n\n        collection = mcoll.QuadMesh(\n            coords, antialiased=antialiased, shading=shading,\n            array=C, cmap=cmap, norm=norm, alpha=alpha, **kwargs)\n        collection._scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)\n\n        coords = coords.reshape(-1, 2)  # flatten the grid structure; keep x, y\n\n        # Transform from native to data coordinates?\n        t = collection._transform\n        if (not isinstance(t, mtransforms.Transform) and\n                hasattr(t, '_as_mpl_transform')):\n            t = t._as_mpl_transform(self.axes)\n\n        if t and any(t.contains_branch_seperately(self.transData)):\n            trans_to_data = t - self.transData\n            coords = trans_to_data.transform(coords)\n\n        self.add_collection(collection, autolim=False)\n\n        minx, miny = np.min(coords, axis=0)\n        maxx, maxy = np.max(coords, axis=0)\n        collection.sticky_edges.x[:] = [minx, maxx]\n        collection.sticky_edges.y[:] = [miny, maxy]\n        corners = (minx, miny), (maxx, maxy)\n        self.update_datalim(corners)\n        self._request_autoscale_view()\n        return collection\n</code>\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, let's analyze the context and how it might relate to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **`LogNorm` Class Not Found**: The search for the `LogNorm` class returned no results. This could imply that the issue might not be directly with the `LogNorm` class itself but how it's being used or integrated with other components. Since `LogNorm` is a part of Matplotlib, it's possible that the search didn't cover external libraries or there was an issue with the search query.\n\n2. **`update_scalarmappable` Method in `matplotlib/collections.py`**: The `update_scalarmappable` method is responsible for updating colors from the scalar mappable array. This method checks if the scalar mappable flags are set and processes the array `_A` to update mapped colors and face/edge colors based on the array and/or directly set colors. The method also handles cases where `_A` is a multidimensional array and where `_alpha` is iterable, adjusting shapes and validating compatibility. This method is crucial for updating the plot with new norms and could be a key area where the issue arises, especially in handling the transition to `LogNorm`.\n\n3. **`pcolormesh` Method in `matplotlib/pyplot.py` and `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`**: The `pcolormesh` method is used for creating a pseudocolor plot with a non-regular rectangular grid. It supports various parameters including `norm`, `cmap`, `vmin`, and `vmax`, which are relevant to the issue. The method in `axes/_axes.py` details the process of creating the mesh, handling shading, and integrating with the `QuadMesh` collection. It also mentions how the `norm`, `vmin`, and `vmax` parameters are scaled and applied to the collection. This could be another critical point where the issue might occur, particularly in how the `norm` is applied or updated after the colorbar has been created.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around how the `LogNorm` is applied to the plot after the colorbar has been created, potentially involving the `update_scalarmappable` method's handling of the norm update and how `pcolormesh` applies the `norm` to the plot. The error message \"Invalid vmin or vmax\" suggests that the problem could be related to how these values are validated or used in the context of `LogNorm`.\n\nTo proceed with diagnosing and fixing the issue, the next steps would involve:\n\n- Reviewing the integration and usage of `LogNorm` with `pcolormesh` and the colorbar, especially any changes between Matplotlib versions 3.6.2 and 3.6.3 that could have affected this functionality.\n- Investigating how `vmin` and `vmax` are validated and applied within the `update_scalarmappable` method and during the norm update process, to identify any potential mismatches or incorrect assumptions that could lead to the \"Invalid vmin or vmax\" error.\n- Considering the absence of direct information on `LogNorm`, looking into the Matplotlib documentation or source code directly might provide additional insights into potential issues or changes in behavior."
