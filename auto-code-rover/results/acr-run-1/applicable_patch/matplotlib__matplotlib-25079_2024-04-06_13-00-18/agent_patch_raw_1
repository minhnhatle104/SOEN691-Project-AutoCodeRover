Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem might not be directly visible in the provided code snippets. The issue described involves an `Invalid vmin or vmax` error when setting the `LogNorm` after the colorbar has been created, which suggests a problem with how the norm's limits are validated or applied. Since the direct cause of the issue isn't immediately apparent from the snippets or the traceback, the patch will focus on ensuring that `vmin` and `vmax` are properly handled when updating the norm for a plot.

However, without a clear indication of a bug in the provided snippets and without direct access to the `LogNorm` implementation (as the search for it returned no results), the following patch is speculative. It aims to add a check or update mechanism for `vmin` and `vmax` when the norm is updated. This approach is based on the assumption that the issue might be related to the norm update not properly re-evaluating or applying `vmin` and `vmax`.

This modification attempts to ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are within the valid range of the data (`_A`) when the norm is updated. It's a speculative fix and assumes that the norm (`LogNorm` in this case) has `vmin` and `vmax` attributes that can be updated directly. This might not be the best or only way to address the issue, especially without more detailed insight into the `LogNorm` class and its interaction with the plotting mechanisms. Further investigation and testing would be necessary to validate this approach and ensure it doesn't introduce other issues.
