### Explanation:
- **Modification 1**: The `__getattribute__` method is patched to demonstrate a more controlled approach to raising exceptions. In practice, raising exceptions unconditionally in `__getattribute__` can cause significant issues, as this method is called for virtually every attribute access. The patched version includes a conditional raise to illustrate handling specific attributes differently, while allowing normal attribute access for others by falling back to `object.__getattribute__`.
  
- **Modification 2**: The `__repr__` method is patched to avoid raising an exception. Since `__repr__` is often called in contexts where exceptions are not expected (e.g., logging, debugging tools), raising an exception here can obscure the real issue and complicate debugging. The patched version provides a safe representation that includes the object's memory address, which can be useful for debugging while avoiding the pitfalls of the original implementation.
