Given the traceback, it's also important to understand how pytest and its plugins might interact with the exception handling in `SomeClass`.\n\nLet's start by searching for `SomeClass` and the `test` function to see if we can get more context about their definitions and usage:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SomeClass\")`: This will help us find the definition of `SomeClass` and possibly other methods within it that were not mentioned in the issue.\n2. `search_method(\"test\")`: Since the function name `test` is quite generic and could be defined in multiple places, searching for it across the entire codebase will help us identify all its occurrences and the specific one that might be causing the issue."
