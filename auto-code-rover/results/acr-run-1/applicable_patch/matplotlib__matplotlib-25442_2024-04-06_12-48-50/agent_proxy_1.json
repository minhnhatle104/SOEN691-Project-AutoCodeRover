            "content": "- do we need more context:\n  - Since the `disconnect` and `on_release` methods were not found directly within the `OffsetBox` class, it's likely they are part of a subclass or a related class that interacts with `OffsetBox`. To get more context, we should look for these methods in the broader codebase or specifically within subclasses or related classes. However, without direct access to subclass names or specific interactions, broad searches might be necessary:\n    - `search_method(\"disconnect\")`\n    - `search_method(\"on_release\")`\n  - Additionally, understanding how `OffsetBox` instances are tied to the canvas and their lifecycle management could provide valuable insights. This might require looking into how `OffsetBox` instances are created and managed, but without specific method names or classes to target, this becomes a more challenging task without further context.\n\n- where are bug locations:\n  - The bug seems to be related to the lifecycle management of objects that interact with the `canvas` attribute. Specifically, the error occurs in the context of calling `mpl_disconnect` on an object that is expected to have a `canvas` attribute but is `None` at the time of the call. This suggests that the bug could be located in the parts of the code that manage these objects' lifecycles, particularly how they are connected to and disconnected from the canvas.\n  - Buggy files and methods:\n    - **File**: `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py`\n      - **Method**: `mpl_disconnect` (This method itself is not buggy, but the way it is called or the state of the object at the time of the call seems to be part of the issue.)\n    - **File**: `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`\n      - The `OffsetBox` class is involved in the issue, but the specific buggy methods or interactions (`disconnect`, `on_release`) were not found in the provided context. They might be in this file as part of subclasses or related mechanisms.\n    - Without direct evidence of where `disconnect` and `on_release` are implemented or called in relation to `OffsetBox`, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact locations beyond these clues."
