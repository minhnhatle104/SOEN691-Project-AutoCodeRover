Henceforth, selecting a new data point will trigger the same traceback. Otherwise, it works fine.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport mplcursors as mpl\nx = np.arange(1, 11)\ny1 = x\nplt.scatter(x,y1)\nmpl.cursor()\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cbook\\__init__.py\", line 304, in process\nfunc(*args, **kwargs)\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1550, in on_release\nif self._check_still_parented() and self.got_artist:\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1560, in _check_still_parented\nself.disconnect()\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1568, in disconnect\nself.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)\nFile \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1517, in <lambda>\ncanvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'\n```\n### Expected outcome\nNo terminal output\n### Additional information\nUsing matplotlib 3.7.0 or lower works fine.

Analyzing its implementation could provide insights into why the `canvas` attribute is being accessed from a `NoneType` object.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"disconnect\", \"OffsetBox\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `mpl_disconnect` method usage**: Since the error occurs when attempting to call `mpl_disconnect` on what appears to be a `NoneType` object, understanding where and how `mpl_disconnect` is used in relation to the `canvas` attribute could be key.\n   - `search_method(\"mpl_disconnect\")`\n\n4. **Search for the `on_release` method in the `OffsetBox` class**: The `on_release` method is part of the traceback, indicating its involvement in the error scenario. Analyzing this method could reveal how the `canvas` attribute is expected to be accessed and why it might be `None`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"on_release\", \"OffsetBox\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the codebase, allowing us to understand the bug's context and guide the development of a patch."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered some crucial information that can help us understand the context of the issue and guide us towards a solution:\n\n1. **OffsetBox Class**: We found the `OffsetBox` class within `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`. This class inherits from `martist.Artist` and contains various methods related to the graphical representation and interaction of offset boxes in matplotlib plots. However, the specific methods `disconnect` and `on_release` that were mentioned in the traceback were not found directly within this class. This suggests that these methods might be indirectly related or part of a subclass or a different mechanism that interacts with `OffsetBox`.\n\n2. **mpl_disconnect Method**: The `mpl_disconnect` method is found in `FigureCanvasBase` class within `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py`. This method is responsible for disconnecting callbacks, identified by a connection id (`cid`), from the canvas. The error in the issue occurs when attempting to call `mpl_disconnect` on what appears to be a `NoneType` object, indicating that the canvas or the object expected to have a canvas attribute is `None` at the time of the call.\n\n3. **Missing Methods in OffsetBox**: The methods `disconnect` and `on_release` were not found in the `OffsetBox` class. This could mean several things:\n   - These methods might be defined in a subclass of `OffsetBox` or in a different class that interacts with `OffsetBox` instances.\n   - The error might be due to a mismanagement of object lifecycle, where an object is expected to be alive (and have a valid `canvas` attribute) but is not.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around the lifecycle management of certain objects within matplotlib, specifically how and when the `canvas` attribute is accessed and expected to be available. The absence of the `canvas` attribute suggests that either the object has been prematurely disposed of or not properly initialized.\n\nTo further diagnose and propose a solution, we might need to:\n- Investigate how `OffsetBox` instances are managed within the matplotlib ecosystem, focusing on their lifecycle and interactions with the canvas.\n- Understand the flow that leads to the `mpl_disconnect` call and why it expects a `canvas` attribute to be present at that time.\n- Look into the subclasses of `OffsetBox` or related classes where `disconnect` and `on_release` might be implemented or used.\n\nGiven the current information, we need to explore the relationship between `OffsetBox` and the canvas more deeply, possibly by examining subclasses of `OffsetBox` or other classes that manage its lifecycle and interactions with the canvas."
