Given the context and the issue at hand, a potential patch could involve ensuring that the `add_select_related` and `add_immediate_loading` methods work together more effectively, particularly when `only()` is used in conjunction with `select_related()` on a reverse `OneToOneField` relation. The goal is to ensure that only the specified fields from both the main model and the related model are included in the SQL query.

However, without a clear indication of a specific bug in the provided methods or a detailed understanding of the internal workings of the Django ORM's compiler, proposing a precise patch is challenging. A general approach to address the issue might involve enhancing the `add_immediate_loading` method to better handle fields from related models specified via `select_related`. This is speculative and should be validated and tested thoroughly.

This modification introduces a speculative approach to handling fields from related models specified via `select_related` within the `add_immediate_loading` method. It attempts to parse out related model fields and adjust the `select_related` structure accordingly. This is a simplified approach and assumes that `select_related` can be modified to include an 'only' directive for related fields, which is not currently part of Django's ORM design. Actual implementation may require a more nuanced approach, including changes in other parts of the ORM to support this functionality.

Please note, this patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential direction for addressing the issue. It should not be applied without thorough testing and validation within the context of Django's ORM behavior and the specific issue at hand.
