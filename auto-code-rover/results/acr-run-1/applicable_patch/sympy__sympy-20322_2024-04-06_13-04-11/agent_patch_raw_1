Given the context and the issue described, it seems that the inconsistency arises due to how expressions involving the `ceiling` function are simplified when `evaluate=False` is passed to `sympify`. The `simplify` function does not directly handle the `evaluate` parameter, but its behavior can be influenced by how the expression is constructed and represented internally after being processed by `sympify`.

The core of the issue might not be directly visible in the provided code snippets for `sympify` and `simplify`, as it could be related to the internal handling and simplification logic that is applied to expressions involving functions like `ceiling`. However, based on the understanding of the issue, a hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that the `evaluate` parameter's intention is preserved throughout the simplification process, especially for functions like `ceiling`.

Since the exact cause and location within the codebase where the behavior change occurs are not pinpointed without a deeper dive into the internal logic and possibly related functions, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to address the issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/sympify.py</file>
<original>expr = parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)</original>
<patched># Ensure that the evaluate parameter is explicitly passed to parse_expr
# and its intention is preserved for further processing.
expr = parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate if evaluate is not None else global_parameters.evaluate)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>expr = sympify(expr)</original>
<patched># Pass through the evaluate parameter to sympify to ensure consistency in expression evaluation
# This requires modifying the simplify function signature to accept an evaluate parameter.
# Note: This is a speculative patch and the actual implementation may require additional changes.
evaluate_param = kwargs.get('evaluate', True)
expr = sympify(expr, evaluate=evaluate_param)</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are speculative and based on the assumption that ensuring the `evaluate` parameter's intention is preserved through the simplification process could address the inconsistency. Actual implementation might require a more in-depth analysis and could involve additional changes in the functions that handle the simplification of expressions involving the `ceiling` function and similar cases.
