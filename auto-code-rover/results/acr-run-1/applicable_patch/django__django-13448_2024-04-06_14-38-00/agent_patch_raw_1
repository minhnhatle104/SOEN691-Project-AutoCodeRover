These modifications ensure that the Django test runner respects the `MIGRATE: False` setting by adjusting the serialization behavior accordingly. The first modification explicitly checks the `MIGRATE` setting before running migrations. The second modification prevents serialization if migrations are skipped, addressing the issue of missing tables. The third modification ensures that the `serialize` parameter passed to `create_test_db` is set to `False` when migrations are disabled, further aligning the test database setup process with the user's configuration.
