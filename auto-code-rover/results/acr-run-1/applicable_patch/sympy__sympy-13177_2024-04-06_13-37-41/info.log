This could mean several things:\n\n1. **The `Mod` function might not be a standalone method** in the codebase.

Here are a few steps we can take next:\n\n1. **Search for a class that could contain the `Mod` function**: Since `Mod` is a mathematical operation, it might be part of a class that deals with mathematical expressions or symbols. Classes like `Expression`, `Symbol`, or similar could be a good starting point.\n\n2. **Broaden the search for the code snippet**: The issue description mentions logic that checks if one operand is a power of another, among other conditions.

Since the exact lines of code and their structure in `sympy/core/mod.py` were not directly provided, the following patch is conceptual and based on the description of the problem.

It corrects the logic by explicitly checking if `q` is not an integer and then applying the correct modulus operation. This approach assumes that the rest of the `Mod` function's logic is capable of handling the more general case correctly and that `p.base ** p.exp % q` is a valid operation within the context of SymPy's handling of expressions.\n\nPlease note, this patch is conceptual and based on the information provided.
