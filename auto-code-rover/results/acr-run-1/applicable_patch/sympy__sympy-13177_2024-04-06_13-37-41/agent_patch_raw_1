Given the context around the issue with the `Mod` function in SymPy, particularly with handling cases where the base is not an integer, let's propose a patch. Since the exact lines of code and their structure in `sympy/core/mod.py` were not directly provided, the following patch is conceptual and based on the description of the problem. The goal is to ensure that `Mod(x**2, x)` correctly handles cases where `x` is not an integer.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/mod.py</file>
<original>
if (p == q or p == -q or
    p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q or
    p.is_integer and q == 1):
    return S.Zero
</original>
<patched>
if (p == q or p == -q or
    (p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q) or
    (p.is_integer and q == 1) or
    (p.is_Pow and p.base == q and q.is_integer)):
    return S.Zero
else:
    # Handle non-integer base case
    if p.is_Pow and not q.is_integer:
        return p.base ** p.exp % q
</patched>
```

This patch adds an additional condition to handle cases where the base (`q`) is not an integer. It corrects the logic by explicitly checking if `q` is not an integer and then applying the correct modulus operation. This approach assumes that the rest of the `Mod` function's logic is capable of handling the more general case correctly and that `p.base ** p.exp % q` is a valid operation within the context of SymPy's handling of expressions.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and based on the information provided. The actual implementation may require adjustments based on the full context of the `Mod` function's implementation in `sympy/core/mod.py`.
