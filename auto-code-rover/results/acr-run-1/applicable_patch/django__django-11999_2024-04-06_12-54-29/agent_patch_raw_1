</patched>
```

Explanation:
The patch modifies the `get_foo_bar_display` method in the `FooBar` class to properly override the method generated by Django for fields with choices. The original method simply returned a hardcoded string `'something'`, which did not account for changes in Django 2.2+ that might affect method resolution or the method signature.

The patched version uses `super()` to call the original `get_foo_bar_display` method provided by Django, ensuring that any logic for handling the display of choice fields is preserved. This approach also adds `*args` and `**kwargs` to the method signature to ensure compatibility with any changes in the parameters expected by the Django-generated method.

This solution assumes that the issue was caused by a change in Django's handling of these automatically generated methods, such as a change in the method signature or in the method resolution order. If the goal is still to return a custom value like `'something'`, the developer can adjust the patched method to include custom logic before or after calling `super().get_foo_bar_display(*args, **kwargs)`.
