        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered the following context about the issue:\n\n1. **Class Definitions**:\n   - There are two classes named `FooBar` within the codebase. One is located in `tests/migrations/test_state.py` and seems to be a simple inheritance example, combining `Foo` and `Bar`. This class is likely not directly related to the issue at hand.\n   - The other `FooBar` class is defined in `tests/model_fields/tests.py`. This class includes a `foo_bar` field defined as an `IntegerField` with choices, which is more aligned with the issue description. Notably, this class attempts to override the `get_foo_bar_display` method.\n\n2. **Method Override**:\n   - The `get_foo_bar_display` method override is found within the `FooBar` class in `tests/model_fields/tests.py`. The method simply returns the string `'something'`, which matches the issue's description. This is the method that is not behaving as expected in Django 2.2+, whereas it worked in Django 2.1.\n\n3. **Method Search**:\n   - The search for a method named `get_FOO_display` returned no results, which suggests that the method name `get_FOO_display` is likely a placeholder or a pattern rather than a specific method name. This aligns with Django's dynamic generation of `get_FOO_display` methods for fields with choices.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around a change in behavior in Django 2.2+ that affects the ability to override dynamically generated methods like `get_foo_bar_display`. Since Django automatically generates these methods for fields with choices to return the human-readable name for the field's current value, the issue likely stems from changes in how Django handles these dynamically generated methods or how it prioritizes method resolution.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to investigate further into Django's release notes or documentation for versions 2.2 and above to understand any changes made to the model fields, particularly regarding methods related to fields with choices. Additionally, reviewing Django's source code for the model field implementation in versions 2.1 and 2.2+ could provide insights into the changes that might have affected the ability to override `get_FOO_display` methods.\n\nA potential workaround might involve explicitly defining the desired behavior in another method and using that method instead of relying on overriding the automatically generated `get_foo_bar_display` method. However, a more precise solution would depend on the specifics of the changes made in Django 2.2+."
