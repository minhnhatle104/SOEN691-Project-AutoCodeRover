            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `simplify` method works, especially in the context of trigonometric functions involving `Rational` numbers. Additionally, understanding the implementation of trigonometric functions like `sin` and `cos` when they are applied to `Rational` numbers could provide insights into why the simplification does not occur as expected. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"simplify\")`: This will help us understand how the `simplify` method is implemented and might give us clues on why it doesn't simplify trigonometric expressions involving `Rational` numbers as expected.\n\n2. `search_class(\"Rational\")`: By looking into the `Rational` class, we can understand how rational numbers are represented and possibly manipulated, which might affect their interaction with trigonometric functions.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"sin\", \"Rational\")`: This call will help us understand if there's a specific implementation of the `sin` function for `Rational` numbers.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"cos\", \"Rational\")`: Similarly, this call will help us understand if there's a specific implementation of the `cos` function for `Rational` numbers.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how the `simplify` method works with trigonometric functions and `Rational` numbers, and why the issue described might be occurring."
