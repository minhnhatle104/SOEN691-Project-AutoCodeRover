        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we can draw several conclusions and outline potential steps for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Simplify Method**: The `simplify` method is found in multiple files across the codebase, with one occurrence in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` being the most relevant to our issue. This suggests that the simplification logic is centralized, but its application might vary depending on the type of expression it is applied to (e.g., boolean algebra, vectors, matrices, etc.).\n\n2. **Rational Class**: The `Rational` class is defined in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and includes a wide range of methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and conversions. Notably, there are no direct implementations of trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`) within the `Rational` class, which implies that the trigonometric simplification for rational numbers might rely on more general mechanisms rather than specialized ones.\n\n3. **Absence of Trigonometric Methods in Rational**: The fact that there are no specific `sin` or `cos` methods for `Rational` instances suggests that when trigonometric functions are applied to `Rational` numbers, they are handled by the general implementations of these functions. This could mean that any limitations in simplifying expressions involving `sin` and `cos` of `Rational` numbers are not due to the handling of `Rational` numbers per se but rather how the trigonometric functions and the `simplify` method interact with these types of expressions.\n\nGiven these insights, the issue seems to stem from how the `simplify` method processes expressions involving trigonometric functions of `Rational` numbers. The `simplify` method might not have specific rules or optimizations for trigonometric expressions involving `Rational` numbers, leading to the observed behavior where such expressions are not simplified as one might expect.\n\nTo address the issue, a potential patch could involve enhancing the `simplify` method (particularly in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`) to include additional rules or heuristics for simplifying trigonometric expressions involving `Rational` numbers. This could involve identifying common trigonometric identities or patterns that apply when the arguments are rational and implementing logic to recognize and apply these simplifications.\n\nBefore proceeding with a patch, it would be prudent to review the existing simplification rules for trigonometric functions in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` to understand the current limitations and identify where enhancements could be made. Additionally, considering the broad impact of changes to the `simplify` method, thorough testing with a variety of expressions would be necessary to ensure that the patch does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior."

If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n\n    If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n    x belongs to the set where this relation is true.
