To address the issue with Sphinx 3.2 complaining about the `.. option:: [enable=]PATTERN` syntax, we need to modify the regular expression (`option_desc_re`) used for validating option descriptions to be more inclusive of different syntaxes. The goal is to allow the `[enable=]PATTERN` syntax while still maintaining the integrity of the validation process.

Given the context retrieved, here is the proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/domains/std.py</file>
<original># RE for option descriptions
option_desc_re = re.compile(r'((?:/|--|-|\+)?[^\s=[]+)(=?\s*.*)')</original>
<patched># RE for option descriptions, updated to allow [enable=]PATTERN syntax
option_desc_re = re.compile(r'((?:/|--|-|\+)?\[?[^\s=\]]+\]?)(=?\s*.*)')</patched>
```

This modification updates the `option_desc_re` regular expression to allow an optional opening bracket `[` at the beginning of the option and a corresponding closing bracket `]` at the end, before the `=` sign if present. This change aims to accommodate the `[enable=]PATTERN` syntax without significantly altering the validation logic for other option formats.

Please note, while this patch aims to resolve the specific issue reported, it's essential to thoroughly test this change to ensure it does not introduce regressions or inadvertently allow invalid option formats.
