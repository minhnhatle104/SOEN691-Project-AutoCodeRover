Given the constraints and the need to include a non-whitespace original code snippet for the edit to be considered valid, I'll adjust the format to include a relevant portion of the existing class definition as the "original" code snippet. This should align with the requirement for modification submissions.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/exceptions.py</file>
<original>    def __repr__(self):
        return 'ValidationError(%s)' % self</original>
<patched>    def __repr__(self):
        return 'ValidationError(%s)' % self

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, ValidationError):
            return NotImplemented

        # Normalize self and other to compare dicts or lists directly
        self_normalized = self.message_dict if hasattr(self, 'error_dict') else self.messages
        other_normalized = other.message_dict if hasattr(other, 'error_dict') else other.messages

        # Direct comparison if both are dicts
        if isinstance(self_normalized, dict) and isinstance(other_normalized, dict):
            return self_normalized == other_normalized

        # Sort lists for comparison if both are lists, ensuring order does not affect equality
        if isinstance(self_normalized, list) and isinstance(other_normalized, list):
            return sorted(self_normalized, key=str) == sorted(other_normalized, key=str)

        # Fallback for direct comparison
        return self_normalized == other_normalized</patched>
```

This modification appends the `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class right after the `__repr__` method. The `__eq__` method enables comparison between two `ValidationError` instances, taking into account both dictionary and list structures of error messages. This approach ensures that `ValidationError` instances with identical messages are considered equal, regardless of the order of those messages, addressing the issue described.
