Please add an __eq__ method that allows two ValidationErrors to be compared.\nIdeally, this would be more than just a simple self.messages == other.messages. It would be most helpful if the comparison were independent of the order in which errors were raised in a field or in non_field_errors.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we have a clearer picture of the `ValidationError` class in Django and its current capabilities regarding the issue at hand. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n1. **Location and Structure of `ValidationError`**:\n   - The `ValidationError` class is found in `django/core/exceptions.py`.\n   - It inherits from `Exception` and includes several methods, such as `__init__`, `message_dict`, `messages`, `update_error_dict`, `__iter__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`. Notably, there's no `__eq__` method, which means instances of `ValidationError` currently do not have a custom way to be compared for equality.\n\n2. **Absence of `__eq__` Method**:\n   - As confirmed by the search, there is no `__eq__` method within the `ValidationError` class. This aligns with the issue description, which requests the addition of such a method to allow for intuitive comparison of `ValidationError` instances.\n\n3. **Handling of Messages**:\n   - The `messages` method provides a way to access the error messages. If the `ValidationError` instance has an `error_dict`, it aggregates all messages from the dictionary into a list; otherwise, it simply returns the list of messages. This method is crucial for understanding how messages are stored and accessed, which is essential for implementing a comparison method that is independent of the order of messages.\n\nGiven these findings, the next steps involve designing and implementing an `__eq__` method for the `ValidationError` class. This method should:\n- Allow two `ValidationError` instances to be considered equal if they contain identical messages, regardless of the order of those messages.\n- Take into account both simple message lists and more complex structures like `error_dict`.\n\nThe absence of an `add` method in the search results suggests that messages are likely added to `ValidationError` instances through other means, possibly during initialization or by directly manipulating the underlying data structures. This detail is less critical for implementing the `__eq__` method but is worth noting for a comprehensive understanding of how `ValidationError` instances are constructed and modified."
