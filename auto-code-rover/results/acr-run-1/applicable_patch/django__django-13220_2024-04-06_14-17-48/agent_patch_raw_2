I apologize for the confusion earlier. Since there was no original code snippet specified for modification (as the task was to add a new method rather than modify an existing one), I'll provide the patch format without specifying an original code block to be replaced, as the addition does not replace but rather appends to the existing code.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/exceptions.py</file>
<original></original>
<patched>class ValidationError(Exception):
    """An error while validating data."""
    ...
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, ValidationError):
            return NotImplemented

        # Normalize self and other to compare dicts or lists directly
        self_normalized = self.message_dict if hasattr(self, 'error_dict') else self.messages
        other_normalized = other.message_dict if hasattr(other, 'error_dict') else other.messages

        # Direct comparison if both are dicts
        if isinstance(self_normalized, dict) and isinstance(other_normalized, dict):
            return self_normalized == other_normalized

        # Sort lists for comparison if both are lists, ensuring order does not affect equality
        if isinstance(self_normalized, list) and isinstance(other_normalized, list):
            return sorted(self_normalized, key=str) == sorted(other_normalized, key=str)

        # Fallback for direct comparison
        return self_normalized == other_normalized
</patched>
```

This modification adds an `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class in `django/core/exceptions.py`. The method enables comparison between two `ValidationError` instances, considering both the cases where errors are stored as dictionaries (`error_dict`) or lists (`error_list`). For dictionary comparisons, it directly compares the `message_dict` properties. For list comparisons, it sorts the lists to ensure that the order of errors does not affect the comparison outcome. This approach addresses the issue by allowing `ValidationError` instances with identical messages to be considered equal, regardless of the order of those messages.
