        "content": "Based on the search result, the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable is defined in the file `src/_pytest/logging.py`. This file seems to be part of the logging configuration, specifically for the pytest framework, given the naming convention and the directory structure. The snippet provided does not show the usage of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`, but its presence in a file named `logging.py` suggests it's centrally used for configuring log messages format throughout the pytest framework or a similar testing setup.\n\nThe issue requests the inclusion of the module name (`name`) in the log format and considers adding the relative path, potentially with substitutions for elements like `$VIRTUAL_ENV`. The current format includes the filename, line number, log level, and the log message itself. The proposed format aims to enhance the utility of the logs by making it easier to identify not just where (filename and line number) but also in which module (`name`) the log was generated. This can significantly improve the debugging process, especially in larger projects with multiple modules that might have files with the same name.\n\nGiven the context and the location of the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. **Understanding how `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is used**: This would involve looking at how this variable is utilized within `src/_pytest/logging.py` and potentially other files if it's imported elsewhere. This can help us understand the scope of the change and if there are any constraints to consider.\n\n2. **Evaluating the feasibility of including the module name and relative path**: Before making changes, it's important to consider how the module name and relative path can be included in the log format. For the module name, the proposed format seems straightforward. However, including the relative path might require additional logic, especially for handling substitutions like `$VIRTUAL_ENV`.\n\n3. **Assessing the impact on existing logs**: Changing the log format can affect how existing logs are parsed and understood. It's important to consider backward compatibility and whether any documentation or tooling that relies on the current format needs to be updated.\n\nGiven the current information, the next step would be to look into how `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is utilized within `src/_pytest/logging.py` to get a clearer picture of the implementation and potential impact of the proposed changes."

        "content": "The search results provide valuable context for understanding how `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is utilized within the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file. Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n1. **Definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`**: The variable is defined at the beginning of the file, setting a specific format for log messages. This format includes the filename, line number, log level, and the message itself.\n\n2. **Usage in `pytest_addoption` function**: The `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is used as the default value for two command-line options:\n   - `--log-format`: This option allows users to specify the log format for output displayed to the console or terminal.\n   - `--log-file-format`: Similarly, this option allows users to specify the log format for output written to a log file.\n\nGiven this context, we can deduce the following:\n\n- **Bug Locations**: The \"bug\" or rather the enhancement request is located in the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file. Specifically, it involves the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable and potentially the `pytest_addoption` function where this variable is used as a default value for logging format options.\n\n- **Enhancement Scope**: The enhancement involves modifying the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` to include the module name (`name`) and possibly the relative path. This change aims to make the logs more informative by providing clearer context about where log messages are coming from.\n\n- **Considerations for Implementation**:\n  - **Compatibility**: Changing the default log format could affect users who rely on the current format for parsing or reading logs. It's important to consider how this change might impact existing workflows or tools.\n  - **Documentation**: Any change to the default logging behavior should be accompanied by updates to the documentation, especially regarding the usage of `--log-format` and `--log-file-format` options.\n  - **Testing**: It's crucial to test the new log format in various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected, including checking how the inclusion of the module name and relative path affects the log output's readability and utility.\n\nBased on this analysis, the next step would be to draft a patch that updates the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable to include the module name and evaluates the feasibility and impact of including the relative path. Additionally, it would be prudent to review and update any relevant documentation and test the changes thoroughly."
