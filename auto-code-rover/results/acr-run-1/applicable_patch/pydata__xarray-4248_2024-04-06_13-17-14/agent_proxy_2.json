Since direct search for `dataset_repr` did not yield results, we could attempt to search for the module or files where this function is likely defined or used. Therefore, a broader search might be necessary:\n    - `search_code(\"formatting\")`\n  - This approach aims to locate the `formatting` module or any references to formatting functions related to the `Dataset` class, which could lead us to the implementation details needed to address the feature request.\n\n- **Where are bug locations:**\n  - Without direct access to the specific implementation details of `dataset_repr`, we cannot precisely pinpoint the exact file and method that need modification. However, based on the analysis, it's clear that the modifications would be related to:\n    - **Potential File:** A file within the `formatting` module or a similar location where dataset representation logic is defined.\n    - **Potential Method/Function:** `dataset_repr` or a similar function responsible for generating the string representation of `Dataset` objects, including formatting of dimensions, coordinates, and data variables."
