Given the constraints and the instructions provided, it seems there was a misunderstanding in my attempt to proceed without further search API calls. However, based on your request for a reevaluation, let's correct the approach:\n\n- **Do we need more context:** Yes, to address the feature request effectively, more context about the implementation of formatting in `xarray` is necessary. Since direct searches for `dataset_repr` and specific tests did not yield detailed results, and considering the guidance for reevaluation, here are revised search API calls that could potentially provide more context:\n\n1. To explore the implementation details within the formatting module, which is crucial for understanding how to include units in the dataset overview, a more general search in the specific file might help:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"def\", \"xarray/core/formatting.py\")`\n\n2. Given the lack of results from the previous attempt to find tests related to formatting, adjusting the approach to search for any tests that involve the dataset's string representation might offer insights:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"repr\", \"xarray/tests/test_formatting.py\")`\n\nThese adjusted search API calls are designed to provide a broader view of the functions defined within the `xarray/core/formatting.py` file and to identify tests related to the dataset's representation in `xarray/tests/test_formatting.py`, which could indirectly lead us to the handling of units in the dataset overview."
