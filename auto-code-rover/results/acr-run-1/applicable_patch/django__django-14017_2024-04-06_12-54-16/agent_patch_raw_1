This patch adds a `__rand__` method to the `Exists` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`. This method is necessary for handling cases where an `Exists` instance is on the right-hand side of an `&` operation with a `Q` instance. The method checks if the other operand is an instance of `Q` and, if so, delegates the combination operation to the `Q` instance's `_combine` method, ensuring commutativity of the `&` operation between `Q` and `Exists` instances. This solution assumes the presence of a `_combine` method in the `Q` class that can handle an `Exists` instance as the other operand, as indicated by the existing context.
