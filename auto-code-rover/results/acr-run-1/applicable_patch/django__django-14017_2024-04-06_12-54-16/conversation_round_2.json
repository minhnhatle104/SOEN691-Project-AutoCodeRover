The error message suggests that the `__and__` method in the `Q` class does not handle instances of `Exists` properly, hinting at a possible missing implementation of `__rand__` in the `Exists` class or a similar issue. Let's start by examining the relevant classes and methods:\n\n1. **Q class implementation**: We need to look into the `Q` class to understand how it handles the `&` operation with other objects.\n2. **Exists class implementation**: Since the issue arises when `Exists` is on the right side of `&`, understanding its implementation will be crucial.\n3. **__and__ method in Q**: The traceback points to this method, so examining its implementation will provide insights into how it processes operands.\n4. **Possible __rand__ method in Exists**: The issue description suggests a missing `__rand__` implementation in `Exists` might be the root cause.\n\nBased on these points, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Q\")`: To get an overview of the `Q` class implementation.\n- `search_class(\"Exists\")`: To understand the `Exists` class and its interaction with bitwise operators.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__and__\", \"Q\")`: To examine the implementation of the `__and__` method in the `Q` class.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__rand__\", \"Exists\")`: To check if the `__rand__` method exists in the `Exists` class and how it's implemented if it exists."

Specifically, when `Exists` is on the right-hand side of the `&` operation, Python attempts to call `__rand__` on the `Exists` instance, which does not exist.\n\n**Solution Approach**:\nTo resolve this issue, we should implement the `__rand__` method in the `Exists` class to handle the case where it is combined with a `Q` object using the `&` operator. This method should properly delegate the operation to ensure that the combination of `Exists` and `Q` instances behaves as expected, regardless of their order.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to implement this solution."
