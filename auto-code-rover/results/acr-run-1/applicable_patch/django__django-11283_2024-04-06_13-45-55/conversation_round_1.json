When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on \u200bdjango-users and was asked to report this here.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the Django migration process, specifically the migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` and how permissions are handled for proxy models. Given the error message relates to the `auth_permission` table and a unique constraint violation, it's crucial to understand how Django creates and updates permissions for proxy models during migrations.\n\nLet's start by searching for the migration file and the method that handles permission updates for proxy models. Since the issue mentions a specific migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions`, we should look for this migration file and any relevant methods that could be involved in updating proxy permissions. Additionally, understanding how Django interacts with the `auth_permission` table during this migration could provide insights into the cause of the unique constraint violation.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the migration file that contains `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` to understand its operations.\n2. Search for methods that are likely involved in updating permissions for proxy models, as these could be part of the migration process or called by it.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can start with the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions\")`: This will help us find the migration file or any references to this specific migration.\n- `search_method(\"update_proxy_permissions\")`: Since the issue mentions a migration named `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions`, it's likely there's a method that specifically handles the update of proxy permissions. This call will help us find such a method if it exists.\n\nThese searches are aimed at gathering more context about the migration process and identifying potential areas in the code that could lead to the described issue."

        "content": "Given the results from the search API calls, it appears that direct references to `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` and a method explicitly named `update_proxy_permissions` are not found within the codebase. This could imply several things:\n\n1. **Migration Naming Convention**: The migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` might not be directly accessible or searchable by its name due to how Django's migration files are structured or named within the project's codebase. Django migrations are typically stored in an app's `migrations` directory with an auto-generated name, making it challenging to search for a migration by its operational name without knowing its file name.\n\n2. **Method Naming or Location**: The absence of a method named `update_proxy_permissions` suggests that the operation to update proxy permissions might not be encapsulated in a single, easily identifiable method. Instead, it could be part of a larger set of operations within the migration process, possibly spread across multiple methods or even handled implicitly by Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system during the migration.\n\nGiven these possibilities, we need to adjust our approach to gather more context and pinpoint the source of the issue. Here are a few steps we can take:\n\n1. **Investigate Django's Migration System**: Since direct references to the migration and method were not found, understanding how Django handles migrations and permissions for proxy models in general could provide insights. This involves looking into Django's source code or documentation related to migrations and proxy models.\n\n2. **Search for Related Code and Concepts**: Instead of searching for the specific migration name or method, we can look for code related to the concepts mentioned in the issue:\n   - Proxy models and their handling during migrations.\n   - The process of permission creation and updates in Django, especially concerning unique constraints in the `auth_permission` table.\n\n3. **Review Django's Auth System**: Given that the issue involves the `auth_permission` table, exploring how Django's authentication system manages permissions, especially in relation to content types and codenames, could be beneficial.\n\nBased on these steps, here are some refined search queries we could consider:\n\n- `search_class(\"ProxyModel\")`: To understand how proxy models are defined and handled.\n- `search_method(\"create_permissions\")`: Assuming permissions are created during migrations, this method (if it exists) could be involved in the process.\n- `search_code(\"auth_permission\")`: To find references to the `auth_permission` table and how it's manipulated during migrations.\n\nLet's proceed with these adjusted strategies to gather more context on the issue."
