**Explanation**: The first modification comments out the pass statement under the `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` condition. This is to ensure that the subsequent conditions, which include the logic for adjusting the skip location reporting, are evaluated even when `--runxfail` is used. The second modification adjusts the condition that changes the location of the failure to ensure it's applied correctly when `--runxfail` is active. This aims to address the issue where the skip location reporting is incorrect when `--runxfail` is used.
