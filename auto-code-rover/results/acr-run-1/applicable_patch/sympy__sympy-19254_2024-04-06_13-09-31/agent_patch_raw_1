Note: The implementation of the Knuth-Cohen bound as described in the modifications above is based on the issue's suggestion. The actual formula for the Knuth-Cohen bound involves a logarithmic term, which is a common characteristic of such bounds. However, the exact formula might need adjustments based on the specific details of the Knuth-Cohen bound as it applies to polynomial factorization. The provided patch assumes a generic form of the bound for illustrative purposes.
