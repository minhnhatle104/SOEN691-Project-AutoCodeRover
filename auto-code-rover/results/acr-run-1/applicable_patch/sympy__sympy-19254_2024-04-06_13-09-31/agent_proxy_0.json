This will help in understanding how to best integrate the proposed Knuth-Cohen bound replacement. Here are the API calls I would like to make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"dup_zz_mignotte_bound\")`: This will help in finding where the `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` method is defined and used across the project.\n2. `search_method(\"dmp_zz_mignotte_bound\")`: This will provide information on the `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` method's definition and usage, which is crucial for understanding its implementation for multi-variant polynomials.\n3. `search_code(\"mignotte_bound\")`: This call is to find any additional references or usage of the term \"mignotte_bound\" which might not be captured by the method-specific searches, including possibly related functions or comments that could provide further insights."
