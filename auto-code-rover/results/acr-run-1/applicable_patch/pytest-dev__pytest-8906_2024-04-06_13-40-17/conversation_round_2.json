To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.\nThe proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).\nThe correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.\nThis area feels a bit unpolished.\nA few ideas to improve:\n1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.\n2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module(\"reason\")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, let's analyze the current state of the project regarding the handling of test skipping, especially at the module level, and how it might be improved according to the issue submitted.\n\n1. **Usage of `skip` Method**:\n   - The `skip` method is defined in `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` and supports an `allow_module_level` parameter, which allows the function to be called at the module level to skip the rest of the module. This aligns with the issue's description, suggesting that the correct solution involves using `skip` with `allow_module_level=True`, though it's noted that this approach is \"actively discouraged by the error message.\"\n\n2. **Occurrences of `allow_module_level=True`**:\n   - The search for `allow_module_level=True` returned 9 snippets across various testing files, indicating that this feature is indeed used within the project. This suggests that there is some precedent for using `allow_module_level=True` to control test execution based on conditions like Python version compatibility.\n\n3. **Absence of `skip_module` Method**:\n   - The search did not find a `skip_module` method in the codebase, which means that the suggestion to introduce a new API like `skip_module(\"reason\")` could be a novel addition to the project, potentially simplifying the process of skipping entire modules under certain conditions.\n\n4. **Usage of `pytestmark` for Skipping**:\n   - The searches for `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip` and `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif` found several instances in the codebase. This indicates that the current recommended approach for skipping tests at the module level involves using these markers. However, as noted in the issue, this approach does not work when the module contains syntax or features that are incompatible with the Python version under which the tests are running, since pytest continues to process the file and fails upon encountering the incompatible syntax.\n\nGiven this context, the issue's suggestions seem to target real limitations within the current test skipping mechanisms provided by pytest, especially when dealing with Python version-specific features at the module level. The idea to either improve the error message related to `allow_module_level=True` to encourage its correct use or to introduce a new, more intuitive API like `skip_module` could help address these limitations. Additionally, enhancing documentation to clearly guide users on how to effectively skip entire modules under certain conditions (e.g., Python version incompatibility) could also be beneficial."

Therefore, there are no specific \"buggy\" files or methods. However, the areas of interest for implementing the suggested improvements would be:\n\n1. **File**: `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`\n   - **Method**: `skip`\n   - This method is directly related to the issue as it contains the implementation of the `skip` function, which supports the `allow_module_level` parameter. Enhancements to its documentation or functionality, as suggested in the issue, would likely be made here.\n\n2. **Documentation and Error Messages**:\n   - While not a specific file or method, improving the documentation and error messages related to the use of `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` and the use of `pytestmark` for module-level skipping would be crucial. This might involve changes to documentation files and possibly adjustments to how error messages are generated when misuse of test skipping features is detected.\n\nThese areas would be the focal points for addressing the suggestions made in the issue to improve the project's handling of test skipping for Python version-specific features at the module level."
