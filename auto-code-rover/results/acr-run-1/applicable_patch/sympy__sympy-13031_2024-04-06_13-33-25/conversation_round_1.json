The issue points to a change in behavior between `sympy` versions 1.0 and 1.1 when handling matrices with zero rows. Let's start by looking into the `Matrix` class and the `hstack` method.\n\nI will use the following search API calls:\n- search_class(\"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"hstack\", \"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"vstack\", \"Matrix\")"

In the context of `sympy`, the `Matrix` class is a fundamental part of the library, used for representing matrices and performing matrix operations. The inability to find the `Matrix` class or the `hstack` and `vstack` methods within it suggests a couple of possibilities:\n\n1. **Misnamed Class or Methods**: It's possible that the class or methods have been renamed or refactored in the version of the codebase being searched. This could happen for a variety of reasons, including optimization or to better reflect the functionality.\n\n2. **Search Limitation**: There might be limitations or issues with the search API being used, leading to false negatives in the search results.\n\nGiven this situation, a more generic approach to gather context might be necessary. Instead of searching directly for the class or methods, which has not yielded results, it might be beneficial to search for the code snippets provided in the issue description. This could help identify the file or the part of the codebase where the relevant logic is implemented, even if the class or method names have changed or were incorrectly specified.\n\nHowever, since the task requires analyzing the collected context before proceeding, and the collected context indicates no direct findings, the next step would involve re-strategizing the approach to gather relevant information. This could involve:\n\n- Broadening the search to include method names or code snippets related to matrix operations in general.\n- Considering alternative names or structures that might be used in the `sympy` codebase for representing and manipulating matrices.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information at hand, a revised approach to gather more context would be necessary to address the issue effectively."
