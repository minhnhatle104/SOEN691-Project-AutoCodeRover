The error message suggests that the check is not correctly identifying subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid. This implies there might be an issue in the implementation of the subclass check, possibly in the `AutoFieldMeta` class or in the method that validates the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting.\n\nGiven this context, we should look into the following areas of the Django codebase:\n\n1. The `AutoFieldMeta` class, to understand how the `__subclasscheck__` method is implemented.\n2. The method that raises the error when the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` does not subclass `AutoField`, which is likely part of the model's options processing (`_get_default_pk_class` method in `options.py` based on the traceback).\n3. The definitions of `AutoField`, `BigAutoField`, and `SmallAutoField` to see how they are related and if they share a common metaclass that could be involved in this issue.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AutoFieldMeta\")` - To find the definition and implementation details of `AutoFieldMeta`.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_get_default_pk_class\", \"options\")` - To inspect the method that validates the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting and raises the error.\n3. `search_class(\"AutoField\")` - To understand the base class's implementation.\n4. `search_class(\"BigAutoField\")` - To check how `BigAutoField` is defined and if it properly subclasses `AutoField`.\n5. `search_class(\"SmallAutoField\")` - Similarly, to check the definition of `SmallAutoField`.\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue and help in identifying the root cause."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered significant information about the components involved in the issue. Let's analyze the context:\n\n1. **AutoFieldMeta**: This is a metaclass used by `AutoField`. The search results show it has properties and methods like `_subclasses`, `__instancecheck__`, and `__subclasscheck__`. The presence of `__subclasscheck__` suggests this metaclass is responsible for determining if a class is considered a subclass of `AutoField`, which is central to the issue at hand. However, the search results do not provide the implementation details of these methods, which are crucial for understanding how the subclass check is performed.\n\n2. **_get_default_pk_class**: The search did not find this method in the class `options`, which suggests there might have been a mistake in the search query, or the method might be located in a different class or module than initially assumed based on the traceback. This method is responsible for validating the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting and raising the error, so its implementation details are key to understanding why the subclass check fails.\n\n3. **AutoField, BigAutoField, and SmallAutoField**: All three fields are found in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. `AutoField` uses `AutoFieldMeta` as its metaclass, which is likely where the subclass check logic is implemented. Both `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are subclasses of `AutoFieldMixin` and their respective field types (`BigIntegerField` and `SmallIntegerField`), but they do not directly subclass `AutoField`. This inheritance structure is important because it suggests that while they are intended to behave similarly to `AutoField` (likely through shared functionality in `AutoFieldMixin`), they might not be recognized as subclasses of `AutoField` by the current implementation of `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the issue seems to stem from how `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` determines subclassing, especially regarding `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. Since these fields do not directly inherit from `AutoField` but are conceptually similar (and likely intended to be used interchangeably in contexts like `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`), the subclass check needs to be adjusted to recognize them as valid subclasses.\n\nTo proceed, we would need to see the implementation details of `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` to understand its current logic and then propose a patch that allows it to recognize `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid subclasses of `AutoField`. Additionally, locating the `_get_default_pk_class` method or the actual method responsible for raising the error about the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting would provide insight into how the check is invoked and what criteria it uses."

        "content": "With the additional context provided by the search results, we can now analyze the implementation details relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **`AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` Implementation**:\n   - Located in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `__subclasscheck__` method in the `AutoFieldMeta` class uses a simple logic to determine if a class is considered a subclass of `AutoField`. It checks if the subclass is present in the `_subclasses` attribute or defers to the superclass's `__subclasscheck__` method.\n   - This implementation suggests that for a custom field class (like `MyBigAutoField`) to be recognized as a subclass of `AutoField`, it must either be explicitly listed in `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses` or be a direct subclass in the traditional inheritance sense. This could be the root of the issue, as `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` might not be recognized as subclasses if they are not included in `_subclasses`.\n\n2. **`_get_default_pk_class` Method**:\n   - Found in `django/db/models/options.py` within the `Options` class, this method is responsible for determining the default primary key class based on the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting. The snippet provided does not show the complete logic, especially how it validates the primary key class against `AutoField`. However, knowing its location and context is crucial because this method is where the validation of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` occurs and where the error is raised if the validation fails.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The issue likely arises because `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` does not recognize `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid subclasses of `AutoField` for the purposes of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`. This is because these fields, despite being conceptually similar to `AutoField`, do not directly inherit from it and are not listed in `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses`.\n- The error is raised in the `_get_default_pk_class` method within the `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py`, which checks the validity of the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting.\n\n**Solution Approach**:\n- To resolve the issue, we could modify `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` to explicitly recognize `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid subclasses. This could involve adding a check to see if the `subclass` argument is either `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField` or any of their subclasses.\n- Alternatively, ensuring that `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are included in `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses` might also resolve the issue, but this approach would require a deeper understanding of how `_subclasses` is populated and managed.\n\nGiven this analysis, we have identified the bug locations and have a clear direction on how to approach fixing the issue."
