Since the issue mentions that an error should be raised when a blueprint name contains a dot, it's likely related to the creation or registration of blueprints. I'll start by searching for methods or classes that might be involved in blueprint handling.\n\n1. `search_class(class_name: \"Blueprint\")`: This will help to find the class definition of Blueprint, which is likely where we need to add validation for the name.\n\n2. `search_method(method_name: \"register_blueprint\")`: Since the issue involves blueprints, there's a good chance that a method like `register_blueprint` is involved in adding them to the application. This method might be where we need to add the error check.\n\n3. `search_code(code_str: \"endpoint names\")`: The issue mentions that an error was added for endpoint names in version 1.0. Searching for this phrase might lead us to the relevant code that handles endpoint name validation, which could provide a template for how to implement the blueprint name validation."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered significant context about how blueprints are handled within the project. Here's a summary of the findings and how they relate to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Blueprint Class**: Found in `src/flask/blueprints.py`, the `Blueprint` class is a crucial part of the blueprint system, providing functionalities like registering URLs, error handlers, and more. The constructor of the `Blueprint` class (`__init__`) takes a `name` parameter among others, which is likely where we need to introduce validation to ensure blueprint names do not contain dots.\n\n2. **Blueprint Registration**:\n    - In `src/flask/app.py`, the `Flask` class has a method `register_blueprint` that registers a `Blueprint` instance with the Flask application. This method delegates to the blueprint's `register` method after performing some setup.\n    - In `src/flask/blueprints.py`, the `Blueprint` class itself also has a `register_blueprint` method, allowing blueprints to register other blueprints. This method could be another place where validation is necessary since it directly deals with blueprint registration.\n\n3. **Endpoint Names Context**: The search for \"endpoint names\" led us to `src/flask/scaffold.py`, where endpoint names are mentioned in the context of mapping them to view functions. This doesn't directly address our issue but provides insight into how endpoint names are handled, which might be similar to how blueprint names should be validated.\n\nGiven these findings, the next steps involve:\n- Adding validation to the `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class to raise an error if the `name` contains a dot. This ensures that when a blueprint is created, its name adheres to the new constraints.\n- Considering whether similar validation should be added to the `register_blueprint` methods in both `Flask` and `Blueprint` classes, to catch any cases where a blueprint might be created or modified dynamically after initialization.\n\nThe primary focus should be on modifying the `Blueprint` class's `__init__` method, as this is the most direct point where the blueprint name is set and can be validated."

This is where the blueprint name is set, and thus, a validation check for dots in the blueprint name should be added.\n    - **Buggy File and Method 2**: While not necessarily buggy, it might be prudent to also consider the `register_blueprint` method in both `src/flask/app.py` (within the `Flask` class) and `src/flask/blueprints.py` (within the `Blueprint` class) for additional validation to ensure robustness against dynamic modifications or registrations that bypass the initial validation."
