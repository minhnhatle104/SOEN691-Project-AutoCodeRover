            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to understand where and how blueprints are handled within the project. Since the issue mentions that an error should be raised when a blueprint name contains a dot, it's likely related to the creation or registration of blueprints. I'll start by searching for methods or classes that might be involved in blueprint handling.\n\n1. `search_class(class_name: \"Blueprint\")`: This will help to find the class definition of Blueprint, which is likely where we need to add validation for the name.\n\n2. `search_method(method_name: \"register_blueprint\")`: Since the issue involves blueprints, there's a good chance that a method like `register_blueprint` is involved in adding them to the application. This method might be where we need to add the error check.\n\n3. `search_code(code_str: \"endpoint names\")`: The issue mentions that an error was added for endpoint names in version 1.0. Searching for this phrase might lead us to the relevant code that handles endpoint name validation, which could provide a template for how to implement the blueprint name validation."
