Specifically, we need to look into the implementation of the `mathml` function, the `MathMLPrinter` class, and how it handles `Indexed` objects. Let's start by gathering more information about these components and the error encountered.\n\n1. **Search for the `Indexed` class**: This will help us understand the structure of an `Indexed` object and why it's not iterable.\n   \n2. **Search for the `MathMLPrinter` class**: Since the error occurs in the `MathMLPrinter` class, understanding its implementation will be crucial.\n\n3. **Search for the `mathml` method**: This method is directly involved in the issue, so we need to see its implementation and how it calls `MathMLPrinter`.\n\n4. **Search for the `_print_Basic` method in the `MathMLPrinter` class**: The traceback shows that the error occurs in this method when it tries to iterate over an `Indexed` object.\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue and how they interact, allowing us to identify the root cause and develop a solution.\n\n- `search_class(\"Indexed\")`\n- `search_class(\"MathMLPrinter\")`\n- `search_method(\"mathml\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Basic\", \"MathMLPrinter\")`"
