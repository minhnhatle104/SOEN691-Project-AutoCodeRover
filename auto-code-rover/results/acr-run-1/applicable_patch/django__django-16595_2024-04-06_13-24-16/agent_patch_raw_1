Based on the context retrieved and the issue described, here is a proposed patch to address the optimization problem with multiple `AlterField` operations in Django migrations. This patch aims to enhance the `AlterField.reduce` method to consider cases where it encounters another `AlterField` operation on the same field, allowing them to be combined into a single operation.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and should be thoroughly tested within the Django framework's existing testing suite to ensure it does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior.

            # Combine the attributes of the two AlterField operations
            new_attributes = {**self.field.deconstruct()[3], **operation.field.deconstruct()[3]}
            # Create a new field with combined attributes
            new_field = self.field.__class__(**new_attributes)
            return [AlterField(
                model_name=self.model_name,
                name=self.name,
                field=new_field,
            )]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)</patched>
```

This modification introduces a new `elif` block within the `AlterField.reduce` method to handle the case when the operation being reduced is another `AlterField` operation on the same field. It combines the attributes of both fields into a new field instance, which is then used to create a single `AlterField` operation. This approach aims to consolidate multiple alterations into a single migration operation, potentially reducing the number of operations and simplifying the migration path.

Remember, this patch is a starting point and might require adjustments based on Django's internal mechanisms and testing outcomes.
