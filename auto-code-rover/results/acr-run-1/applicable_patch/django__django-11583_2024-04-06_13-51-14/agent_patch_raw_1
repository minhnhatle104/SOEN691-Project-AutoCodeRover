Given the nature of the issue, which involves intermittent failures due to an "embedded null byte" error potentially when resolving file paths, a direct patch might involve adding a safeguard in the methods that handle file paths. Since the issue seems to stem from the interaction with Python's `pathlib` and the auto-reloading mechanism, we can attempt to sanitize the paths or handle the specific `ValueError` to prevent the auto-reloader from crashing.

                if isinstance(e, ValueError) and 'embedded null byte' in str(e):

            yield file, mtime</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by filtering out paths that contain null bytes before they can cause errors and by explicitly handling the `ValueError` related to "embedded null byte" in the `snapshot_files` method. This approach should mitigate the issue without requiring significant changes to the underlying logic of file monitoring and auto-reloading.
