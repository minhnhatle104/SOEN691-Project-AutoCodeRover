        "content": "The issue describes a problem with the `uniq` function, which is located in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file. The `uniq` function is designed to yield unique elements from a given sequence (`seq`) as an iterator. The implementation tries to maintain a set of seen elements and yields elements that haven't been seen before. If a `TypeError` is encountered (which can happen if the elements of the sequence are unhashable and cannot be added to a set), it falls back to using a list (`result`) to keep track of seen elements and recursively calls itself to handle the rest of the sequence.\n\nThe reported issue is that when `uniq` is used with a list that is being modified during iteration (specifically, elements are being removed), it can lead to incorrect behavior because the function does not account for the possibility that the sequence (`seq`) might change size during iteration. The user suggests that a similar approach to what Python does with dictionaries and sets (raising a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration) should be adopted for `uniq` to prevent silent incorrect results.\n\nGiven this context, the key points to address in a patch would be:\n\n1. Detecting changes to the size of the input sequence during iteration.\n2. Raising an appropriate error if such a change is detected, to alert the user that modifying the sequence during iteration is not supported.\n\nThis approach would align with the behavior of built-in Python structures like dictionaries and sets, making it more intuitive and safer for users. Let's proceed to draft a solution based on this analysis."
