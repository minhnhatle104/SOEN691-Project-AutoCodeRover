Specifically, we need to understand the current implementation to identify where the validation for `n_neighbors` should be added or improved. \n\nGiven the information in the issue, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `NearestNeighbors` class**: This will help us understand the class structure and potentially find where `n_neighbors` is initially processed.\n   \n2. **Search for the `kneighbors` method in the `NearestNeighbors` class**: Since the issue mentions that the `kneighbors` method should also work with a float value for `n_neighbors`, we need to see its current implementation to understand where the type check and conversion should occur.\n\nHence, the API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"NearestNeighbors\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"kneighbors\", \"NearestNeighbors\")`"
