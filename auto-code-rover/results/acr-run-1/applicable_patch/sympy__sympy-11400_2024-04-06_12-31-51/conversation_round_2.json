Can be a string, ``Symbol``,\n        ``MatrixSymbol``, or ``Indexed`` type. This is helpful in case of\n        line-wrapping, or for expressions that generate multi-line statements.\n    precision : integer, optional\n        The precision for numbers such as pi [default=15].\n    user_functions : dict, optional\n        A dictionary where the keys are string representations of either\n        ``FunctionClass`` or ``UndefinedFunction`` instances and the values\n        are their desired C string representations. Alternatively, the\n        dictionary value can be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test,\n        cfunction_string)].  See below for examples.\n    dereference : iterable, optional\n        An iterable of symbols that should be dereferenced in the printed code\n        expression.

If an\n    ``assign_to`` variable is provided an if statement is created, otherwise\n    the ternary operator is used. Note that if the ``Piecewise`` lacks a\n    default term, represented by ``(expr, True)`` then an error will be thrown.\n    This is to prevent generating an expression that may not evaluate to\n    anything.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Piecewise\n    >>> expr = Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True))\n    >>> print(ccode(expr, tau))\n    if (x > 0) {\n    tau = x + 1;\n    }\n    else {\n    tau = x;\n    }\n\n    Support for loops is provided through ``Indexed`` types. With\n    ``contract=True`` these expressions will be turned into loops, whereas\n    ``contract=False`` will just print the assignment expression that should be\n    looped over:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Eq, IndexedBase, Idx\n    >>> len_y = 5\n    >>> y = IndexedBase('y', shape=(len_y,))\n    >>> t = IndexedBase('t', shape=(len_y,))\n    >>> Dy = IndexedBase('Dy', shape=(len_y-1,))\n    >>> i = Idx('i', len_y-1)\n    >>> e=Eq(Dy[i], (y[i+1]-y[i])/(t[i+1]-t[i]))\n    >>> ccode(e.rhs, assign_to=e.lhs, contract=False)\n    'Dy[i] = (y[i + 1] - y[i])/(t[i + 1] - t[i]);'\n\n    Matrices are also supported, but a ``MatrixSymbol`` of the same dimensions\n    must be provided to ``assign_to``. Note that any expression that can be\n    generated normally can also exist inside a Matrix:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix, MatrixSymbol\n    >>> mat = Matrix([x**2, Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True)), sin(x)])\n    >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 3, 1)\n    >>> print(ccode(mat, A))\n    A[0] = pow(x, 2);\n    if (x > 0) {\n       A[1] = x + 1;\n    }\n    else {\n       A[1] = x;\n    }\n    A[2] = sin(x);\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return CCodePrinter(settings).doprint(expr, assign_to)\n</code>\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the `ccode` method in the `sympy/printing/ccode.py` file, we can understand how the `ccode` function operates and its capabilities. The `ccode` function is designed to convert a SymPy expression into a string of C code. It supports a wide range of features, including:\n\n- Conversion of mathematical expressions and functions to C code.\n- Assignment of expressions to variables.\n- Custom printing definitions for certain types through the `user_functions` parameter.\n- Handling of `Piecewise` expressions by converting them into conditional statements.\n- Support for loops through `Indexed` types, with control over tensor contraction rules.\n- Support for matrices, requiring a `MatrixSymbol` of matching dimensions for assignments.\n\nThe issue reported is specifically about the `sinc` function not being supported directly by `ccode`. The `sinc` function, which is defined as `sin(x)/x` for `x != 0` and `1` for `x = 0`, does not have a direct equivalent in C's `math.h` library, and thus, `ccode` does not automatically convert it to C code. Instead, it outputs a comment indicating that `sinc` is not supported.\n\nGiven this context, the solution to the issue would involve implementing a workaround for the `sinc` function. This could be done by manually converting the `sinc` function into a `Piecewise` expression that matches its definition, as suggested by the issue submitter. This approach is supported by `ccode`, as it can convert `Piecewise` expressions into conditional statements in C code.\n\nTo proceed with fixing the issue, we would need to:\n1. Identify where in the `ccode` function or its related components the `sinc` function is handled or could be intercepted.\n2. Implement a mechanism to detect the `sinc` function and convert it into an equivalent `Piecewise` expression before the conversion to C code takes place.\n3. Ensure that this conversion does not negatively impact other functionalities or the handling of other expressions by `ccode`.\n\nGiven the current context, the next steps would involve examining the implementation details of the `CCodePrinter` class and any related functions or methods that handle the conversion of functions like `sinc`. This would help in identifying the appropriate place to implement the workaround for the `sinc` function."

The `CCodePrinter` class inherits from `CodePrinter` and is tailored specifically for C code generation, with methods dedicated to handling various types of expressions and constructs in C.\n\nKey points about the `CCodePrinter` class include:\n- It has a set of default settings that can be customized, including precision, user-defined functions, and handling of reserved words.\n- It contains numerous specialized print methods (e.g., `_print_Pow`, `_print_Rational`, `_print_Piecewise`, etc.) for converting SymPy expressions to their C code equivalents.\n- The class supports printing of complex constructs such as matrices, indexed elements, and piecewise expressions, among others.\n\nGiven the issue with the `sinc` function not being directly supported in C code generation, the `CCodePrinter` class is indeed the right place to implement a solution. Specifically, the class lacks a dedicated method for handling the `sinc` function, which is why it defaults to indicating that `sinc` is not supported.\n\nTo address the issue, we can propose the following steps:\n1. **Implement a new method in `CCodePrinter` for handling `sinc` expressions**: This method would detect expressions involving the `sinc` function and convert them into an equivalent `Piecewise` expression that defines `sinc(x)` as `sin(x)/x` for `x != 0` and `1` for `x = 0`.\n2. **Integrate this method with the existing printing mechanism**: Ensure that when the `CCodePrinter` encounters a `sinc` function, it utilizes this new method to generate the appropriate C code.\n3. **Test the implementation**: It's crucial to verify that the new method correctly handles various cases, including when `sinc` is part of more complex expressions, to ensure it doesn't introduce errors or regressions in the code generation process.\n\nThis approach would enable `ccode` to support the `sinc` function by leveraging the existing infrastructure for handling `Piecewise` expressions, which is already well-supported in C code generation."
