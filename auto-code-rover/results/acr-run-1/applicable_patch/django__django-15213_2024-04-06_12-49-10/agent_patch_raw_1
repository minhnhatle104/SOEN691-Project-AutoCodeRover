Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential patch could involve ensuring that the SQL compilation process correctly handles the case of negated `Q` objects, especially when they are wrapped in an `ExpressionWrapper`. Since the issue seems to arise from the interaction between `ExpressionWrapper`'s `as_sql` method and the negation process in `Q.__invert__`, we need to ensure that the negated condition results in valid SQL.

However, without direct access to the SQL compiler logic and how it interprets different expressions, we can hypothesize a patch that might involve adjusting the `ExpressionWrapper` to handle negated `Q` objects more explicitly. This is a speculative solution based on the provided context.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query_utils.py</file>
<original>    def __invert__(self):
        obj = type(self)()
        obj.add(self, self.AND)
        obj.negate()
        return obj
</original>
<patched>    def __invert__(self):
        obj = type(self)()
        obj.add(self, self.AND)
        obj.negate()
        # Ensure the negated Q object is correctly interpreted as a condition that can be compiled into SQL.
        obj.condition = 'NOT' if not hasattr(obj, 'condition') else obj.condition
        return obj
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        return compiler.compile(self.expression)
</original>
<patched>    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        # Check if the expression is a negated Q object and adjust the compilation process accordingly.
        if hasattr(self.expression, 'condition') and self.expression.condition == 'NOT':
            compiled_expression, params = compiler.compile(self.expression)
            return f"NOT ({compiled_expression})", params
        return compiler.compile(self.expression)
</patched>
```

These modifications are speculative and aim to address the issue by ensuring that negated `Q` objects are explicitly handled during the SQL compilation process. The first modification adds a `condition` attribute to negated `Q` objects to mark them as negated. The second modification adjusts the `ExpressionWrapper`'s `as_sql` method to check for this `condition` attribute and modify the SQL compilation process accordingly.

It's important to note that these patches are hypothetical and would need to be tested thoroughly in the context of the Django project to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new ones.
