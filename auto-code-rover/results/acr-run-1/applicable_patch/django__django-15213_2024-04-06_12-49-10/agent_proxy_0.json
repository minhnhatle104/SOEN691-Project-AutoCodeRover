Specifically, we need to understand how `ExpressionWrapper`, `Q`, and possibly the `annotate` method work within the project's codebase. Given the information in the issue, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of the `ExpressionWrapper` class, which seems to be central to the issue.\n2. `search_class(\"Q\")`: Since the issue involves the use of `Q` objects, understanding its implementation will be crucial.\n3. `search_method(\"annotate\")`: The `annotate` method is mentioned as part of the workflow that leads to the issue, so we need to understand how it interacts with `ExpressionWrapper` and `Q` objects.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the problem."
