Modifications here are necessary to explicitly remove duplicates at the outset and to potentially incorporate logic for handling intersections involving symbolic elements in a manner consistent with the issue description.\n2. `_handle_finite_sets`: This method deals with the handling of finite sets within intersections. Enhancements here could improve the evaluation of intersections involving symbolic elements, possibly incorporating the expected `Piecewise` behavior or leaving expressions unevaluated under certain conditions."
