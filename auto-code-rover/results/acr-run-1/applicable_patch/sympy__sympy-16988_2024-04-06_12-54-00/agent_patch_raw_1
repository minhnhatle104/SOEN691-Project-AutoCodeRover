# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/sets/sets.py</file>
<original>        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))

        obj = Basic.__new__(cls, *args)
        obj._argset = frozenset(args)
        return obj</original>
<patched>        # Ensure args are unique and ordered for canonical processing
        unique_args = list(ordered(frozenset(args), Set._infimum_key))

        obj = Basic.__new__(cls, *unique_args)
        obj._argset = frozenset(unique_args)
        return obj</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by first ensuring duplicates are removed and handling symbolic elements in a way that checks for equality conditions, potentially returning a `Piecewise` expression as described in the issue. The second modification ensures that the arguments are both unique and ordered before the `Intersection` object is created, reinforcing the removal of duplicates and canonical processing.
