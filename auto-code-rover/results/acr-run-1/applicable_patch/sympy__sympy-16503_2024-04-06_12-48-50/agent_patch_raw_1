```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2</original>
<patched>prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2 - 1 if ascii_mode else max_upper + sign_height//2</patched>
```

This patch adjusts the baseline for the pretty-printed output of the `Sum` function, taking into account whether ASCII mode is enabled. The adjustment aims to align the `x` and the `+ 3` correctly by slightly modifying the baseline when in ASCII mode. This change is based on the observation that the misalignment might be due to differences in how characters are rendered in ASCII versus Unicode mode. By conditionally adjusting the baseline when ASCII mode is active, we aim to achieve better alignment across both rendering modes.
