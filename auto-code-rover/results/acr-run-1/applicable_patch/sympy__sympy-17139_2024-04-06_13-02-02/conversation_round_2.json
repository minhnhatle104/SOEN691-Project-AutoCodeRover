If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(1 - log(a)))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n\n    If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n    x belongs to the set where this relation is true. The default is\n    False.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    expr = sympify(expr)\n    kwargs = dict(ratio=ratio, measure=measure,\n        rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n\n    # no routine for Expr needs to check for is_zero\n    if isinstance(expr, Expr) and expr.is_zero and expr*0 is S.Zero:\n        return S.Zero\n\n    _eval_simplify = getattr(expr, '_eval_simplify', None)\n    if _eval_simplify is not None:\n        return _eval_simplify(ratio=ratio, measure=measure, rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n\n    original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n\n    from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n    from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n    from sympy import Sum, Product, Integral\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n        return expr\n\n    if inverse and expr.has(Function):\n        expr = inversecombine(expr)\n        if not expr.args:  # simplified to atomic\n            return expr\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n        return expr.func(*[simplify(x, **kwargs) for x in expr.args])\n\n    if not expr.is_commutative:\n        expr = nc_simplify(expr)\n\n    # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n    # is it a purely rational function?

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we can start piecing together how the issue might be occurring and where we might need to apply a fix. The issue reported is a `TypeError` raised due to an invalid comparison of the complex number `I` in the `__lt__` method within `sympy/core/expr.py`. This error emerges when simplifying an expression involving `cos(x)**I` using the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.\n\n### Key Points from the Context:\n\n1. **Simplify Function:**\n   - The `simplify` function attempts to apply various heuristics to make the input expression simpler. It's a high-level function that delegates to more specific simplification functions based on the nature of the expression.\n   - It uses the `bottom_up` function to apply transformations to all expressions in an expression tree from the bottom up.\n\n2. **Trigsimp Function:**\n   - The `trigsimp` function is one of the specific simplification functions called by `simplify`. It reduces expressions by using known trig identities.\n   - It can use different methods for simplification, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. The traceback does not specify which method led to the error, but it's involved in the process.\n\n3. **_futrig Function:**\n   - This function is a helper for `futrig` and is involved in the trigonometric simplification process. It applies a series of transformations to trigonometric functions within the expression.\n   - The error might be related to how expressions involving complex numbers are handled or transformed in this function or one of the transformations it applies.\n\n4. **__lt__ Method:**\n   - This method performs less-than comparisons but raises a `TypeError` if the comparison involves complex numbers that are not extended real numbers. This is where the actual error is raised.\n   - The error suggests that somewhere in the simplification process, an invalid comparison involving the complex number `I` is attempted.\n\n5. **Bottom_up Function:**\n   - This function applies a given transformation `F` to all expressions in an expression tree from the bottom up. It's used within the `simplify` function to apply simplifications.\n   - The issue might be related to how this function handles expressions involving complex numbers or how it applies transformations that lead to invalid comparisons.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven the nature of the error and the functions involved, the issue likely arises from how expressions involving the complex number `I` are handled during the simplification process, particularly in trigonometric simplification. A transformation applied to `cos(x)**I` might result in an expression that leads to an invalid comparison when further simplifications or transformations are attempted.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo address the issue, we need to:\n- Investigate how complex numbers, especially expressions involving `I`, are handled in the trigonometric simplification process (`_futrig` and related transformations).\n- Review the logic in the `__lt__` method to understand under what circumstances it raises a `TypeError` for complex numbers and if there's a way to avoid reaching this state through earlier simplification steps.\n- Consider if a check or transformation needs to be added either in the `simplify` function or one of the trigonometric simplification functions to handle expressions like `cos(x)**I` more gracefully.\n\nA patch would likely involve modifying how expressions involving complex numbers are simplified or adding checks to prevent invalid comparisons from being attempted."

This is inferred from the traceback indicating an issue during trigonometric simplification.\n  - **Buggy File and Method 2:** `sympy/core/expr.py`, in the `__lt__` method. This is where the TypeError is explicitly raised due to an invalid comparison of complex `I`. However, the root cause likely lies in how expressions are simplified or transformed before reaching this comparison, rather than a bug in the comparison logic itself."
