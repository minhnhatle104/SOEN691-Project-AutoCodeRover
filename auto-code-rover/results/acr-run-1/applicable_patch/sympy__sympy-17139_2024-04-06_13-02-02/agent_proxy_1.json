This is inferred from the traceback indicating an issue during trigonometric simplification.\n  - **Buggy File and Method 2:** `sympy/core/expr.py`, in the `__lt__` method. This is where the TypeError is explicitly raised due to an invalid comparison of complex `I`. However, the root cause likely lies in how expressions are simplified or transformed before reaching this comparison, rather than a bug in the comparison logic itself."
