Given the context and the nature of the issue described, a plausible patch would involve ensuring that the `show_hidden_initial` property is correctly utilized in the form field definitions, particularly for `ArrayField` or similar fields that might be causing the issue. Since the specific locations of `RelatedModelForm` and `RelatedModelInline` were not found, and based on the information provided, we can't directly modify those. However, we can suggest a generic approach to address the issue described, which involves ensuring that `show_hidden_initial` is set to `False` where necessary to prevent the default values from being incorrectly propagated or validated.

Assuming the issue is with how `ArrayField` or similar fields handle their default values in conjunction with `show_hidden_initial`, a patch could be applied to the form field definition to explicitly set `show_hidden_initial=False`. This approach is speculative, as we don't have direct access to the `RelatedModelForm` or the specific form field definitions causing the issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/fields.py</file>
<original>show_hidden_initial=False,</original>
<patched>show_hidden_initial=True,</patched>
```
This modification reverses the default behavior of `show_hidden_initial` for all form fields, which is not recommended as a permanent solution but could be used for testing if this change affects the issue. It's a broad change affecting all form fields, so it should be tested thoroughly.

# modification 2
Since we don't have the exact location or definition of the `ArrayField` or the form where the issue occurs, a more targeted patch cannot be provided without speculating on the code structure. However, for fields that are causing issues, setting `show_hidden_initial` explicitly when defining the form field might resolve the problem.

For a hypothetical `ArrayField` in a form (assuming `ArrayField` is causing the issue and is used within a form directly or indirectly):

```python
<file>path/to/your/forms.py</file>
<original>your_array_field = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=42), default=list)</original>
<patched>your_array_field = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=42), default=list, show_hidden_initial=False)</patched>
```

Please note, the above modification assumes that `ArrayField` accepts `show_hidden_initial` as a parameter, which might not be the case. The actual implementation would depend on how `ArrayField` is defined and used within your project. If `ArrayField` is a Django model field and not a form field, the approach would need to be adjusted accordingly, potentially by modifying the form field that corresponds to this model field in the admin form or formset where it's used.

Given the limitations of the information provided and the speculative nature of these patches, it's crucial to review the actual implementation details of your project's forms and admin configurations related to `Thing` and `RelatedModel`.
