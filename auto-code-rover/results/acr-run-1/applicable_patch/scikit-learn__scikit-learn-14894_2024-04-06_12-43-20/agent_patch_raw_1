This patch addresses the potential division by zero in the calculation of `dual_coef_indptr` by checking if `n_class` is greater than 0 before performing the division. Additionally, it ensures that if either `n_class` or `n_SV` (number of support vectors) is 0, resulting in an empty `support_vectors_`, a sparse matrix of appropriate shape is created without attempting to use possibly invalid indices or indptr, thus avoiding the `ZeroDivisionError`.
