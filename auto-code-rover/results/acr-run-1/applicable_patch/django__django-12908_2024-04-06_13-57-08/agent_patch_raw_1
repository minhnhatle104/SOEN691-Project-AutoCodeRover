Given the context and the issue at hand, the problem seems to be that the `distinct` method's behavior when applied after a `union` operation, especially with field names specified, does not work as expected. The expected behavior, based on the issue description, is to apply `DISTINCT ON (field)` to the combined queryset resulting from the `union`. However, the current implementation does not seem to support this directly.

To address this issue, we can enhance the `union` method to ensure that it correctly handles the scenario where `distinct` with specific field names is called on the result of a `union`. This involves modifying the `_combinator_query` method used by `union` to preserve information about distinct fields so that it can be applied correctly.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and might require adjustments based on the full context of the Django ORM's internal workings and compatibility considerations.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>def distinct(self, *field_names):
    """
    Return a new QuerySet instance that will select only distinct results.
    """
    assert not self.query.is_sliced, \
        "Cannot create distinct fields once a slice has been taken."
    obj = self._chain()
    obj.query.add_distinct_fields(*field_names)
    return obj</original>
<patched>def distinct(self, *field_names):
    """
    Return a new QuerySet instance that will select only distinct results.
    """
    assert not self.query.is_sliced, \
        "Cannot create distinct fields once a slice has been taken."
    obj = self._chain()
    obj.query.add_distinct_fields(*field_names)
    # Mark the queryset to preserve distinct fields after union
    obj._preserve_distinct_fields = True
    return obj</patched>
```

This patch attempts to address the issue by marking the queryset to preserve distinct fields when `distinct` is called, and modifying the `union` method to respect this marking. It's a conceptual solution and would need thorough testing, especially for edge cases and to ensure it doesn't introduce regressions or performance issues.
