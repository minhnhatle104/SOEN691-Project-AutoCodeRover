Specifically, I will search for the `Sample` class to understand its structure and any custom methods it might have that are relevant to the issue. Additionally, I will look into the `union` and `distinct` methods as they are directly related to the problem described. Since the issue mentions the use of `.annotate()`, `.union()`, and `.distinct()` in a chain, it's crucial to understand how these methods are implemented or overridden in the project's codebase.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Sample\")`: This will help understand the structure of the `Sample` class and any custom behavior that might be affecting the issue.\n\n2. `search_method(\"union\")`: Since the issue involves the `.union()` method not working as expected with `.distinct()`, it's important to see how `union` is implemented or used across the codebase.\n\n3. `search_method(\"distinct\")`: This will provide insight into how the `distinct` method is implemented or overridden, which is crucial for understanding why it's not working as expected after a `.union()` call.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue and formulating a solution."
