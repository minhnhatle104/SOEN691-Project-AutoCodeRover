**Note**: This patch assumes that the `Q` object has a `kwargs` attribute that stores the query parameters. The function `convert_to_pickleable` is introduced to convert non-pickleable types like `dict_keys` to a pickleable type (e.g., list) before the `Q` objects are combined. This approach ensures that serialization does not fail when such types are included. However, since the original code snippet does not show the complete implementation of the `Q` class, including how its attributes are defined and managed, you might need to adjust the patch to fit the actual structure of the `Q` class in Django.
