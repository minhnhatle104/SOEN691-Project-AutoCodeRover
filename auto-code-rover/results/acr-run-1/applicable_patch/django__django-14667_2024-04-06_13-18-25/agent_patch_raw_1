**Explanation**:
These modifications aim to address the issue where chaining `defer()` and `only()` methods does not behave as expected. The core of the problem lies in how deferred and immediate loading fields are managed when these methods are used together.

- **Modification 1** adjusts the behavior of the `defer()` method to check if `only()` has been called previously and ensure that fields specified in `only()` are not deferred unnecessarily. It does this by calculating the difference between existing deferred fields and the fields specified in `only()`, then updating the deferred fields accordingly.

- **Modification 2** changes the `only()` method to consider any fields that have been deferred by a previous call to `defer()`. It ensures that fields specified in `defer()` are not marked for immediate loading by `only()`, maintaining the integrity of deferred loading while allowing `only()` to function as intended.

These patches aim to ensure that the `defer()` and `only()` methods can be chained together in any order while behaving as expected, respecting the intentions behind deferring and immediately loading specific fields.
