            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `defer()` and `only()` methods are implemented within the Django ORM (assuming this is a Django project based on the terminology used). Specifically, we need to look into how these methods interact when chained together and why the expected behavior of limiting selected fields is not achieved when `defer()` follows an `only()` call.\n\nGiven this context, let's proceed with the following API calls to gather more information about the implementation:\n\n1. **Search for the `QuerySet` class**: Since the issue is related to the behavior of `QuerySet` methods, we need to find where this class is defined in the codebase.\n   - `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `defer` method within the `QuerySet` class**: Understanding the implementation of `defer()` will help us identify why it doesn't clear deferred fields when chained with `only()`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"defer\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `only` method within the `QuerySet` class**: Similarly, we need to understand how `only()` is implemented to see how it interacts with `defer()`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"only\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\nThese searches should provide sufficient context to begin diagnosing the issue and formulating a patch."
