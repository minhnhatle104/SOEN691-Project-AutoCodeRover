            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method works within the `SI` class, and how it interacts with expressions, especially those involving the exponential function `exp`. Given the information in the issue, we will start by looking into the `SI` class and the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. Additionally, we'll look into how the `exp` function is handled in the context of units and dimensions.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SI\")`: This will help us find where the `SI` class is defined within the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_collect_factor_and_dimension\", \"SI\")`: This will provide us with the implementation details of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within the `SI` class.\n3. `search_code(\"exp(expr)\")`: Since the issue arises when the `exp` function is used with an expression involving units, searching for how `exp(expr)` is handled in the context of units might give us additional insights."
