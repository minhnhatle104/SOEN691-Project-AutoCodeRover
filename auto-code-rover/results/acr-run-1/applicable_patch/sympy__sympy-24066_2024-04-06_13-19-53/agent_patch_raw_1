**Explanation**: The patch addresses the issue where the exponent in a `Pow` expression with dimensions causes a `ValueError` due to incorrect handling of dimensionality. The original code attempted to apply the exponent's dimensions directly in the operation, which is mathematically incorrect when the exponent is not dimensionless. The patched version checks if the exponent's dimensions are dimensionless; if so, it proceeds with the operation using only the scale factor of the exponent (`exp_factor`). If the exponent has dimensions, it raises a `ValueError`, explicitly stating that the exponent is not dimensionless. This approach ensures that the operation adheres to the mathematical rules regarding dimensions in exponents, preventing the application of dimensions in contexts where they are not mathematically valid.
