Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential cause could be the handling of `Piecewise` expressions during substitution, especially when combined with symbolic assumptions and operations like division and application of functions like `exp`. The error message "PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense" suggests that the issue might arise from how these `Piecewise` expressions are transformed or evaluated during the substitution process.

However, without a clear indication of a specific bug or misbehavior in the provided code snippets, proposing a precise patch is challenging. The code for `subs` in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `_eval_subs` in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` does not exhibit an obvious flaw that could lead to the described error. The problem might be more subtle, possibly involving the interaction between different parts of the SymPy library or specific edge cases not handled by the current implementation.

Given this, a hypothetical patch might involve adding additional checks or handling for `Piecewise` expressions in the substitution process, ensuring that operations like division and function application do not lead to invalid states or errors. However, without a deeper investigation and understanding of the root cause, any specific code changes would be speculative.

For educational purposes, here's an example of how one might approach writing a patch if a specific issue had been identified:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py</file>
<original>
def _eval_subs(self, old, new):
    # this is strictly not necessary, but we can keep track
    # of whether True or False conditions arise and be
    # somewhat more efficient by avoiding other substitutions
    # and avoiding invalid conditions that appear after a
    # True condition
    args = list(self.args)
    args_exist = False
    for i, (e, c) in enumerate(args):
        c = c._subs(old, new)
        if c != False:
            args_exist = True
            e = e._subs(old, new)
        args[i] = (e, c)
        if c == True:
            break
    if not args_exist:
        args = ((Undefined, True),)
    return self.func(*args)
</original>
<patched>
def _eval_subs(self, old, new):
    # Enhanced handling for Piecewise expressions during substitution
    args = list(self.args)
    args_exist = False
    for i, (e, c) in enumerate(args):
        c = c._subs(old, new)
        if c != False:
            args_exist = True
            e = e._subs(old, new)
        args[i] = (e, c)
        if c == True:
            break
    # Check for and handle specific cases that could lead to errors
    # This is a placeholder for additional logic to prevent errors
    # like the PolynomialError in specific substitution scenarios
    if some_specific_condition_not_handled_properly(args):
        handle_the_condition(args)
    if not args_exist:
        args = ((Undefined, True),)
    return self.func(*args)
</patched>
```

This example is purely illustrative and does not represent a real solution to the issue without further analysis and understanding of the underlying problem. In practice, fixing such an issue would require identifying the exact conditions under which the error occurs and implementing a targeted solution to handle those cases correctly.
