Given the context and the nature of the issue, a precise patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of how pytest's internal mechanisms handle path resolution in relation to the current working directory. However, I can propose a conceptual approach to address the issue based on the provided code snippets and the problem description.

The issue arises when the working directory is changed within a fixture, causing paths in error messages to be relative to the new directory, not the original project directory. A potential solution involves ensuring that paths in error messages are always reported relative to the project root or the original working directory before any fixture-induced changes.

Since the provided code snippets do not directly show where the paths in error messages are constructed, the patch will focus on conceptual changes that could be applied to ensure correct path handling.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>def rewrite_asserts(mod, source, module_path=None, config=None):
    """Rewrite the assert statements in mod."""
    AssertionRewriter(module_path, config, source).run(mod)
</original>
<patched>import os
from pathlib import Path

def rewrite_asserts(mod, source, module_path=None, config=None):
    """Rewrite the assert statements in mod."""
    # Ensure module_path is always relative to the original working directory
    original_cwd = Path(config.rootdir) if config else Path(os.getcwd())
    if module_path is not None:
        module_path = original_cwd / Path(module_path).relative_to(Path(module_path).anchor)
    AssertionRewriter(module_path, config, source).run(mod)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>def _should_rewrite(self, name, fn, state):
    # always rewrite conftest files
    if os.path.basename(fn) == "conftest.py":
        state.trace("rewriting conftest file: {!r}".format(fn))
        return True
</original>
<patched>import os
from pathlib import Path

def _should_rewrite(self, name, fn, state):
    # Convert fn to be relative to the original working directory
    original_cwd = Path(self.config.rootdir) if self.config else Path(os.getcwd())
    fn = original_cwd / Path(fn).relative_to(Path(fn).anchor)
    
    # always rewrite conftest files
    if os.path.basename(str(fn)) == "conftest.py":
        state.trace("rewriting conftest file: {!r}".format(fn))
        return True
</patched>
```

These modifications are conceptual and aim to ensure that paths are handled relative to a consistent base directory, mitigating the issue of incorrect path reporting when the working directory is changed. Further testing and refinement would be necessary to ensure compatibility and effectiveness across different pytest configurations and use cases.
