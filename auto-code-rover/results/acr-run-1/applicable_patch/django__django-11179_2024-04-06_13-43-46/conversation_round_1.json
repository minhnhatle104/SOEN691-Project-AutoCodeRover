The reference \"Django.db.models.deletion:276-281\" seems to be intended to point towards lines 276 to 281 in a file related to model deletion within Django's framework, specifically in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. However, the search did not yield results, possibly due to an incorrect file path or an issue with the search query format.\n\nTo proceed with gathering context and understanding the issue better, we need to adjust our approach. The issue at hand is related to the behavior of the `.delete()` method on Django model instances that do not have any dependencies. Specifically, the primary key (PK) of the model instance is not being cleared (set to `None`) after the `.delete()` method is called, which is not the expected behavior.\n\nGiven this information, a more effective strategy would be to directly search for the `.delete()` method within the context of Django models to understand how it's currently implemented and to identify where the adjustment needs to be made. Since the exact location within the codebase was not successfully identified in the initial search, we can try a broader search to find the `.delete()` method implementation in Django models.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather more context:\n1. Search for the `.delete()` method within the Django model class to understand its current implementation.\n2. Search for any code or comments that might reference the behavior of setting the PK to `None` after deletion, as this is the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_method_in_class(\"delete\", \"Model\")\n- search_code(\"self.pk = None\")"
