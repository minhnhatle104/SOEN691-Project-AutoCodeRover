The reference \"Django.db.models.deletion:276-281\" seems to be intended to point towards lines 276 to 281 in a file related to model deletion within Django's framework, specifically in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. However, the search did not yield results, possibly due to an incorrect file path or an issue with the search query format.\n\nTo proceed with gathering context and understanding the issue better, we need to adjust our approach. The issue at hand is related to the behavior of the `.delete()` method on Django model instances that do not have any dependencies. Specifically, the primary key (PK) of the model instance is not being cleared (set to `None`) after the `.delete()` method is called, which is not the expected behavior.\n\nGiven this information, a more effective strategy would be to directly search for the `.delete()` method within the context of Django models to understand how it's currently implemented and to identify where the adjustment needs to be made. Since the exact location within the codebase was not successfully identified in the initial search, we can try a broader search to find the `.delete()` method implementation in Django models.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather more context:\n1. Search for the `.delete()` method within the Django model class to understand its current implementation.\n2. Search for any code or comments that might reference the behavior of setting the PK to `None` after deletion, as this is the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_method_in_class(\"delete\", \"Model\")\n- search_code(\"self.pk = None\")"

        "content": "The collected context provides valuable insights into the issue and its potential location within the Django codebase.\n\n### Analysis of the `delete` Method in `Model` Class\n\nThe `delete` method found in `django/db/models/base.py` within the `Model` class does not include any operation that sets the primary key (`self.pk`) to `None` after a model instance is deleted. This method's primary responsibility is to ensure that the model instance can be deleted (i.e., its primary key is not `None`), collect related objects using a `Collector`, and then proceed with the deletion. However, it lacks the functionality to reset the primary key of the instance once the deletion is complete.\n\n### Analysis of the `self.pk = None` Search\n\nThe search for `self.pk = None` led us to a snippet in `django/db/models/options.py` within the `Options` class `__init__` method. This code snippet is unrelated to the deletion process; instead, it's part of the initialization of model options, setting default values for various attributes, including `self.pk`.\n\n### Conclusion and Bug Location\n\nBased on the analysis, the bug is located in the `delete` method of the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`. The method currently does not include functionality to set the model instance's primary key to `None` after deletion, which is the expected behavior described in the issue.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo resolve the issue, a patch needs to be applied to the `delete` method in the `Model` class. This patch should include setting the primary key of the model instance to `None` after the deletion process has successfully completed. This change will ensure that the model instance reflects its new state accurately, indicating that it no longer exists in the database.\n\n- **where are bug locations**: The bug is located in the file `django/db/models/base.py`, specifically within the `delete` method of the `Model` class."
