Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\nparser = CommandParser(\nprog=self.prog_name,\nusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\nadd_help=False,\nallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we can analyze the context surrounding the issue:\n\n1. **ManagementUtility Class**: The `ManagementUtility` class is defined in `django/core/management/__init__.py`. It contains several methods, including `__init__`, `main_help_text`, `fetch_command`, `autocomplete`, and `execute`. The `__init__` method is particularly relevant to the issue, as it initializes the `argv` parameter and sets `self.prog_name` based on it. This class is central to the issue described.\n\n2. **execute_from_command_line Method**: This method is also located in `django/core/management/__init__.py`. It creates an instance of `ManagementUtility` by passing `argv` to it and then calls the `execute` method on this instance. This method is the entry point mentioned in the issue, which indirectly leads to the problem when `sys.argv[0]` is `None`.\n\n3. **CommandParser Instantiation**: The instantiation of `CommandParser` that needs modification is found within the `execute` method of the `ManagementUtility` class, also in `django/core/management/__init__.py`. The current instantiation does not pass the `prog` argument, which should be `self.prog_name` according to the issue description. Instead, it relies on the default behavior, which uses `sys.argv[0]`.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\n- All parts of the issue are located within the same file: `django/core/management/__init__.py`.\n- The issue arises because `CommandParser` is instantiated without explicitly setting the `prog` argument to `self.prog_name`, which leads to incorrect behavior in environments where `sys.argv[0]` is not set correctly.\n- To address the issue, the instantiation of `CommandParser` within the `execute` method of the `ManagementUtility` class needs to be modified to include `prog=self.prog_name`.\n\nThe next step would be to draft a patch that includes this modification to ensure that `ManagementUtility` uses the correctly computed `prog_name` when instantiating `CommandParser`."
