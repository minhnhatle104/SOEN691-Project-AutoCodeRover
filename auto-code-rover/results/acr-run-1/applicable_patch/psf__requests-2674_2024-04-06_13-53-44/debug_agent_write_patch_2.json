        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides us with insights into how the `requests` library handles exceptions, especially those originating from `urllib3`, and how it might be failing to wrap `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` exceptions properly.\n\n1. **RequestException Class**: The `RequestException` class is found in `requests/exceptions.py` and is a subclass of `IOError`. This is likely the base class for all exceptions raised by the `requests` library. The presence of this class in `exceptions.py` suggests that this file is where we might expect to find or add wrappers for `urllib3` exceptions.\n\n2. **Usage of `urllib3.exceptions`**: The search for `urllib3.exceptions` shows that these exceptions are referenced in three files: `requests/exceptions.py`, `requests/adapters.py`, and `requests/models.py`. The presence in `requests/exceptions.py` indicates there might already be some handling or re-raising of `urllib3` exceptions. The multiple matches in `requests/adapters.py` suggest this file could be a key integration point with `urllib3`, where exceptions might be caught and potentially need to be wrapped. The match in `requests/models.py` also indicates usage that might be relevant to the issue.\n\n3. **Handling of `DecodeError`**: The `DecodeError` from `urllib3` is explicitly caught in `requests/models.py` within the `Response` class's `iter_content` and `json` methods. In the `iter_content` method, it's re-raised as a `ContentDecodingError`, which suggests that at least for this specific case, there is an attempt to wrap `urllib3` exceptions with `requests`-specific exceptions. However, this wrapping might not be comprehensive or consistent across the library.\n\n4. **References to `TimeoutError`**: The `TimeoutError` is mentioned in both `requests/adapters.py` and `requests/models.py`, indicating that this exception is handled in multiple places. The presence in `adapters.py` suggests that timeout-related exceptions from `urllib3` might be caught and processed here, which is relevant to the issue reported about proxy timeouts not being properly wrapped.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that while there is some mechanism in place to catch and re-raise `urllib3` exceptions as `requests` exceptions, it might not be consistently applied across all cases, particularly for `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`. The next step would involve reviewing the specific code snippets where these exceptions are handled to identify gaps in the wrapping logic and propose appropriate patches."

This inconsistency can lead to confusion for users of the `requests` library, who might expect all exceptions thrown by the library to be of types defined within `requests.exceptions`.\n\n2. **Identified Bug Locations**:\n   - **`requests/models.py`**: This file contains references to handling `DecodeError`, where it is caught and re-raised as a `ContentDecodingError`, a `requests`-specific exception. This indicates an attempt to wrap `urllib3` exceptions but suggests that the approach might not be uniformly applied across the library.\n   - **`requests/adapters.py`**: This file is mentioned to contain multiple references to handling `TimeoutError`. While specific methods were not pinpointed, it's a key area for investigating how `TimeoutError`, especially in the context of proxy timeouts, is handled within the `requests` library.\n\n3. **Proposed Solution**:\n   - Review and potentially refactor exception handling in **`requests/adapters.py`** and **`requests/models.py`** to ensure that all `urllib3` exceptions are caught and re-raised as appropriate `requests` exceptions. This might involve adding new exception classes to `requests.exceptions` if necessary, to cover all cases of `urllib3` exceptions.\n   - Ensure consistency in how exceptions are wrapped across the library. This could involve creating a utility function or a context manager within `requests` that standardizes the process of catching `urllib3` exceptions and re-raising them as `requests` exceptions.\n   - Add comprehensive tests to verify that `urllib3` exceptions are correctly wrapped by `requests` exceptions in all scenarios, including when proxies are involved and when decoding errors occur.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - Implement the proposed changes in a development branch of the `requests` library.\n   - Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests and integration tests, to ensure that the changes do not introduce regressions and that all `urllib3` exceptions are now properly wrapped.\n   - Review the changes with the `requests` library maintainers and the community for feedback.\n   - Once approved, merge the changes into the main branch and prepare for a new release of the `requests` library.\n\nI hope this approach provides a clear path forward in addressing the issue.

This assumes there's a direct catch of `TimeoutError` that needs to be wrapped.\n\n```python\n<file>requests/adapters.py</file>\n<original>\n                except TimeoutError as e:\n                    raise e\n</original>\n<patched>\n                from requests.exceptions import Timeout\n                except TimeoutError as e:\n                    raise Timeout(\"The request timed out.\", e)\n</patched>\n```\n\n### Modification 3: Ensure `requests/exceptions.py` includes a generic wrapper for `urllib3` exceptions\n\nThis modification ensures that there's a generic way to catch and wrap `urllib3` exceptions that might not have specific handling in `requests`.\n\n```python\n<file>requests/exceptions.py</file>\n<original>\n# Assuming there's a section where urllib3 exceptions are imported or referenced\nfrom urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError\n</original>\n<patched>\n# Import all urllib3 exceptions and create a generic wrapper function\nfrom urllib3.exceptions import *\n\ndef wrap_urllib3_exception(e):\n    \"\"\"Wrap urllib3 exceptions in a Requests exception.\"\"\"\n    # This is a simplified example. A more comprehensive implementation would map specific urllib3 exceptions to specific requests exceptions.\n    if isinstance(e, DecodeError):\n        return ContentDecodingError(\"A decoding error occurred.\", e)\n    elif isinstance(e, TimeoutError):\n        return Timeout(\"The request timed out.\", e)\n    else:\n        return RequestException(\"An error occurred.\", e)\n</patched>\n```\n\nPlease note, these modifications are hypothetical and aim to illustrate the approach to solving the reported issue. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full context of the `requests` library's codebase, including existing exception handling mechanisms and the structure of both `requests` and `urllib3` exception classes."

        "content": "Given the constraints and the inability to directly view or interact with the actual codebase, I'll provide a conceptual patch based on standard practices for wrapping exceptions in Python. This conceptual approach should guide the necessary modifications in the `requests` library to address the issue of `urllib3` exceptions not being properly wrapped.\n\n### Conceptual Patch for Wrapping `urllib3` Exceptions\n\n#### Modification 1: Enhancing `DecodeError` Handling in `requests/models.py`\n\n```python\n<file>requests/models.py</file>\n<original>\nfrom .packages.urllib3.exceptions import (\n    DecodeError, ReadTimeoutError, ProtocolError, LocationParseError)\n</original>\n<patched>\nfrom .packages.urllib3.exceptions import (\n    DecodeError, ReadTimeoutError, ProtocolError, LocationParseError)\nfrom .exceptions import (\n    RequestException, ContentDecodingError, ReadTimeout, ProtocolError as RequestsProtocolError, LocationParseError as RequestsLocationParseError)\n</patched>\n```\n\nIn the `Response.iter_content` and `Response.json` methods, ensure `DecodeError` is wrapped into a `requests` specific exception, such as `ContentDecodingError`. If this is already the case, ensure consistency and completeness of this pattern across all methods.\n\n#### Modification 2: General Approach to Wrapping Exceptions in `requests/adapters.py`\n\nSince the specific code snippets were not matched, I'll provide a conceptual approach to handling `TimeoutError` and potentially other `urllib3` exceptions in a generic way.\n\n```python\n<file>requests/adapters.py</file>\n<original>\n# Hypothetical original handling of TimeoutError without proper wrapping\n</original>\n<patched>\nfrom requests.exceptions import Timeout, RequestException\nfrom urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError\n\ntry:\n    # Code that might raise a TimeoutError from urllib3\nexcept TimeoutError as e:\n    raise Timeout(e)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise RequestException(e)\n</patched>\n```\n\n#### Modification 3: Creating a Wrapper Function for `urllib3` Exceptions\n\nThis modification suggests adding a utility function to wrap `urllib3` exceptions. This function could be used across the `requests` library wherever `urllib3` exceptions need to be caught and wrapped.\n\n```python\n<file>requests/utils.py</file>  # Assuming utils.py is an appropriate place for utility functions\n<original>\n# This is a new addition, so there's no original code to replace.\n</original>\n<patched>\nfrom urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError, DecodeError, TimeoutError\nfrom requests.exceptions import HTTPError as RequestsHTTPError, ContentDecodingError, Timeout\n\ndef wrap_urllib3_exception(err):\n    if isinstance(err, DecodeError):\n        return ContentDecodingError(err)\n    elif isinstance(err, TimeoutError):\n        return Timeout(err)\n    elif isinstance(err, HTTPError):\n        return RequestsHTTPError(err)\n    else:\n        return RequestException(err)\n</patched>\n```\n\nPlease note, these modifications are conceptual and aim to illustrate the approach to solving the reported issue. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full context of the `requests` library's codebase, including existing exception handling mechanisms and the structure of both `requests` and `urllib3` exception classes."
