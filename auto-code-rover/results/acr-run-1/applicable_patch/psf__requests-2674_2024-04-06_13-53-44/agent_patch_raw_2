Given the constraints and the inability to directly view or interact with the actual codebase, I'll provide a conceptual patch based on standard practices for wrapping exceptions in Python. This conceptual approach should guide the necessary modifications in the `requests` library to address the issue of `urllib3` exceptions not being properly wrapped.

### Conceptual Patch for Wrapping `urllib3` Exceptions

#### Modification 1: Enhancing `DecodeError` Handling in `requests/models.py`

```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import (
    DecodeError, ReadTimeoutError, ProtocolError, LocationParseError)
</original>
<patched>
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import (
    DecodeError, ReadTimeoutError, ProtocolError, LocationParseError)
from .exceptions import (
    RequestException, ContentDecodingError, ReadTimeout, ProtocolError as RequestsProtocolError, LocationParseError as RequestsLocationParseError)
</patched>
```

In the `Response.iter_content` and `Response.json` methods, ensure `DecodeError` is wrapped into a `requests` specific exception, such as `ContentDecodingError`. If this is already the case, ensure consistency and completeness of this pattern across all methods.

#### Modification 2: General Approach to Wrapping Exceptions in `requests/adapters.py`

Since the specific code snippets were not matched, I'll provide a conceptual approach to handling `TimeoutError` and potentially other `urllib3` exceptions in a generic way.

```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original handling of TimeoutError without proper wrapping
</original>
<patched>
from requests.exceptions import Timeout, RequestException
from urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError

try:
    # Code that might raise a TimeoutError from urllib3
except TimeoutError as e:
    raise Timeout(e)
except Exception as e:
    raise RequestException(e)
</patched>
```

#### Modification 3: Creating a Wrapper Function for `urllib3` Exceptions

This modification suggests adding a utility function to wrap `urllib3` exceptions. This function could be used across the `requests` library wherever `urllib3` exceptions need to be caught and wrapped.

```python
<file>requests/utils.py</file>  # Assuming utils.py is an appropriate place for utility functions
<original>
# This is a new addition, so there's no original code to replace.
</original>
<patched>
from urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError, DecodeError, TimeoutError
from requests.exceptions import HTTPError as RequestsHTTPError, ContentDecodingError, Timeout

def wrap_urllib3_exception(err):
    if isinstance(err, DecodeError):
        return ContentDecodingError(err)
    elif isinstance(err, TimeoutError):
        return Timeout(err)
    elif isinstance(err, HTTPError):
        return RequestsHTTPError(err)
    else:
        return RequestException(err)
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are conceptual and aim to illustrate the approach to solving the reported issue. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full context of the `requests` library's codebase, including existing exception handling mechanisms and the structure of both `requests` and `urllib3` exception classes.
