This will help understand how the form submission is processed.\n5. `search_code(\"ModelMultipleChoiceField\")`: To find all occurrences of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` usage which might give additional context on how querysets are being manipulated across the project.\n6. `search_method(\"union\")`: To understand how the `union()` method is implemented or overridden within the project, which might be causing the unexpected behavior.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of how the models, form, and queryset manipulations are implemented, which is crucial for diagnosing the reported issue."
