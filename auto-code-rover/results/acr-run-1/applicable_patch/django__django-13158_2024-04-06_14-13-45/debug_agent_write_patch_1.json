However, changing the ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset to use union() breaks things.\npublications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\nPublication.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(\nPublication.objects.filter(id__gt=5)\n),\nrequired=False,\n)\nThe form correctly shows only the matching objects. However, if you submit this form while empty (i.e. you didn't select any publications), ALL objects matching the queryset will be added.

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, we can start analyzing the issue related to the `QuerySet.none()` behavior on combined queries, specifically when using `union()`. Here's a summary of the relevant findings:\n\n1. **Publication Model**: The `Publication` model is defined in multiple files but generally contains a `title` field and possibly a `date_published` field. This model is straightforward and doesn't seem to contain custom methods that could directly affect the issue.\n\n2. **Article Model**: The `Article` model is mentioned across various files, but the specific implementation related to the issue wasn't directly retrieved. However, it's clear that it has a `ManyToManyField` to `Publication`, which is central to the issue.\n\n3. **ArticleForm Class**: There are multiple `ArticleForm` classes across the codebase, but the specific one related to the issue wasn't identified in the search results. The absence of a custom `clean` method in the `ArticleForm` class means the handling of form submissions and empty fields likely follows Django's default behavior, which is crucial for understanding the issue.\n\n4. **ModelMultipleChoiceField Usage**: The `ModelMultipleChoiceField` is used across various parts of the codebase, including in forms and model forms. This field type is key to the issue, as it's used to present and process the selection of related `Publication` instances in the `ArticleForm`.\n\n5. **Union Method**: The `union()` method is implemented in Django's `QuerySet` class and is designed to combine querysets. The specific behavior when used with `EmptyQuerySet` is to combine all non-empty querysets, which might be relevant to understanding the issue when the form is submitted empty.\n\nThe issue described involves unexpected behavior when submitting an `ArticleForm` with a `publications` field defined as a `ModelMultipleChoiceField` using a queryset combined with `union()`. When the form is submitted empty, instead of adding no `Publication` objects to an `Article`, all objects matching the queryset are added. This contrasts with the expected behavior, where no objects should be added, similar to when using the `|` operator for queryset combination.\n\nGiven this context, the problem might lie in how Django's form handling and queryset combination with `union()` interact, especially in the context of `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. The behavior of `union()` in handling `EmptyQuerySet` instances, as described in the search results, suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or a bug in how empty form submissions are processed and how they interact with combined querysets using `union()`.\n\nTo proceed with solving the issue, we would need to:\n- Review Django's documentation and source code related to `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and `union()` to understand their intended behavior in this context.\n- Examine the form handling logic in Django to see how empty `ModelMultipleChoiceField` submissions are processed.\n- Consider creating a minimal reproducible example to test the behavior and see if it deviates from the expected behavior as defined by Django's documentation or if there's a specific edge case caused by the project's implementation.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for identifying whether the issue is a bug in Django, a misunderstanding of Django's intended behavior, or an issue with how the project's code is written."

However, none of these tests directly mention the use of `union()`, which is central to the issue at hand. The tests cover various aspects of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` usage, including validation, query efficiency, handling of initial data, and deduplication of values. This suggests that the standard behaviors of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` are well-tested, but there might not be tests that specifically address the scenario described in the issue.\n\n2. **Absence of union in tests/model_forms/tests.py**: The search did not find any usage of `union()` within `tests/model_forms/tests.py`. This absence could mean that the specific combination of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` with a queryset using `union()` has not been tested or considered in the project's test suite. This gap could be why the issue was not previously identified.\n\n3. **Article Model's save Method**: The `save` method in the `Article` model does not appear to contain custom logic that would directly affect the handling of the `publications` field beyond setting a `created` date when the article is first saved. This suggests that the issue is unlikely to be within the custom `save` method of the `Article` model.\n\nGiven this analysis, the issue seems to lie in the interaction between `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and querysets combined using `union()`, specifically in scenarios where the form is submitted with no selections made. The absence of tests covering this specific scenario means that the behavior observed might not have been intentionally designed or considered, leading to unexpected results.\n\nTo address the issue, the following steps could be considered:\n\n- **Write a Test**: Given the absence of tests covering the use of `union()` with `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, the first step would be to write a test that replicates the issue. This test would involve creating a form with a `ModelMultipleChoiceField` using a queryset combined with `union()`, submitting the form without selections, and asserting that no objects are added.\n\n- **Investigate Django's Handling of Empty Submissions**: Since the issue involves form submissions where no selections are made, it's crucial to understand how Django handles empty submissions for `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and how this might interact differently with querysets combined using `union()` compared to other methods like the `|` operator.\n\n- **Review QuerySet Combination Logic**: The `union()` method's handling of empty or null querysets should be reviewed to ensure that it behaves as expected in the context of form fields like `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. This might involve diving into Django's source code or documentation to understand the intended behavior and whether the issue observed is a bug or a misuse of the API.\n\nThis analysis points towards a need for further investigation into Django's form handling and queryset combination logic, as well as the addition of tests to cover this specific scenario."

However, the analysis suggests areas for further investigation:\n\n1. **Django's Form Handling System**: Specifically, how `ModelMultipleChoiceField` processes and validates empty submissions. While not a specific file or method, this area in Django's source code related to form fields and their handling of querysets could be where the unexpected behavior originates.\n\n2. **QuerySet `union()` Method**: Located in `django/db/models/query.py`, the `union()` method's handling of empty or null querysets when used in conjunction with form fields like `ModelMultipleChoiceField` could be contributing to the issue. This method's interaction with form submissions, especially empty ones, might not align with expectations or could be missing specific handling for this scenario.\n\nWithout more context or the ability to directly inspect and debug the project's codebase, pinpointing a more specific bug location is challenging.

        "content": "Given the need for more precise identification of the bug's location and the complex nature of the issue involving Django's form and queryset handling, further investigation is indeed necessary. However, based on the information and analysis provided so far, we can refine our approach and seek more targeted context about Django's handling of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` with `union()` querysets and form submissions. Since direct access to more detailed project code or Django's internal handling is not available in this format, a precise bug location cannot be pinpointed without speculation.\n\nTo move forward in a real-world scenario, the following steps would be recommended:\n\n1. **Review Django Documentation and Source Code**: Specifically, look into the implementation of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and the `union()` method in querysets. The Django documentation might provide insights into expected behaviors or known limitations. The source code, especially around form field validation and queryset combination logic, would be the next place to check for nuances in handling empty submissions or combined querysets.\n\n2. **Debugging and Local Testing**: Implementing a minimal reproducible example that mirrors the issue can be invaluable. By submitting the form with different configurations (using `union()`, using the `|` operator, with and without selections) and debugging the submission process, insights into where the behavior diverges from expectations might be found. This process could involve stepping through Django's form handling and queryset evaluation logic.\n\n3. **Community Resources and Reporting**: If the behavior is indeed unexpected and not documented, searching through Django's issue tracker for similar reports or asking for insights on platforms like Django Users Google Group or Stack Overflow could clarify whether this is a known issue or expected behavior. If it appears to be a bug or undocumented behavior, reporting it to the Django project with a detailed issue description and a minimal reproducible example would be the next step.\n\nWithout the ability to perform these actions directly in this format, and based on the information provided, further speculation on the precise bug location within Django's codebase would not be productive. The steps outlined above are recommended for anyone facing similar issues in their projects."

        "content": "With the additional context provided by the search results for `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and the `union` method, we can delve deeper into the analysis of the issue at hand.\n\n### ModelMultipleChoiceField Analysis\nThe `ModelMultipleChoiceField` class, found in `django/forms/models.py`, inherits from `ModelChoiceField` and is designed to handle multiple selections for model instances. It includes several key methods that could be relevant to the issue:\n\n- `__init__`: Initializes the field with a queryset among other parameters.\n- `to_python`: Converts the input value to a Python datatype.\n- `clean`: Validates the input form data, returning the cleaned data or raising a ValidationError if the data is invalid.\n- `prepare_value`: Prepares the value for widget rendering.\n- `has_changed`: Determines if the field's data has changed.\n\nGiven the issue description, the `clean` method stands out as particularly relevant. This method is responsible for ensuring that the submitted values are valid selections according to the provided queryset. However, the description of the issue suggests that when the form is submitted with no selections (an empty submission), the behavior diverges based on whether the queryset is combined using `union` or the `|` operator.\n\n### Union Method Analysis\nThe `union` method, found in `django/db/models/query.py`, is designed to combine querysets. The method's implementation includes a specific behavior for handling `EmptyQuerySet` instances, attempting to combine all non-empty querysets provided as arguments. This behavior is crucial in understanding why the form submission might behave differently when using `union` compared to other queryset combination methods like the `|` operator.\n\n### Hypothesis Based on Analysis\nThe issue might stem from how `ModelMultipleChoiceField`'s `clean` method interacts with the queryset provided to it, especially when that queryset is the result of a `union` operation. If the `union` operation leads to a queryset that behaves differently from expectations (for instance, treating an empty submission as a selection of all items in the queryset under certain conditions), this could explain the observed behavior.\n\n### Potential Bug Locations\nBased on this analysis, potential locations for the bug could include:\n- The `clean` method of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` in `django/forms/models.py`, particularly in how it handles empty submissions and validates them against the queryset.\n- The `union` method in `django/db/models/query.py`, especially the logic that handles `EmptyQuerySet` instances and how this might affect the queryset's behavior when used in a form field.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo further investigate and potentially resolve the issue, the following steps could be considered:\n- Review the `clean` method's implementation in `ModelMultipleChoiceField` to understand how it processes and validates empty submissions.\n- Examine the `union` method's handling of `EmptyQuerySet` instances to see if there's a discrepancy in how combined querysets are treated compared to expectations.\n- Create a minimal reproducible example that demonstrates the issue, allowing for debugging and testing of potential fixes.\n\nThis analysis provides a clearer direction for investigating the issue, focusing on the interaction between `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and querysets combined using `union`."

This method is crucial for validating the input form data and ensuring that the submitted values are valid selections according to the provided queryset. The issue might arise in how this method interprets or validates empty submissions against a queryset that has been combined using the `union` method.\n\n2. **Buggy File**: `django/db/models/query.py`\n   - **Method**: `union` method of the `QuerySet` class. The specific handling of `EmptyQuerySet` instances within this method and how it affects the behavior of the queryset when used in conjunction with `ModelMultipleChoiceField` could be contributing to the observed issue. The interaction between the `union` method and form field validation, particularly for empty submissions, may not align with expectations.\n\nThese locations are identified based on the hypothesis that the issue stems from the interaction between `ModelMultipleChoiceField`'s validation logic (especially for empty submissions) and the behavior of querysets combined using `union`. Further investigation, debugging, and testing based on these insights would be necessary to confirm the exact nature of the bug and to develop an appropriate fix."

This approach aims to provide a consistent behavior for empty submissions, regardless of how the queryset was originally constructed (e.g., using `union()` or other methods). This change addresses the issue where submitting an empty form resulted in all objects being added instead of none, by ensuring that an explicitly empty queryset is returned for empty submissions."
