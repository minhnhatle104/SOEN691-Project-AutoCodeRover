However, potential areas of interest based on the issue description and the analysis might include:\n\n1. The implementation of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` in `django/forms/models.py` could be a location to investigate, especially how it handles empty submissions and interacts with combined querysets.\n2. The handling of `union()` in combined querysets, particularly in cases involving empty submissions, within `django/db/models/query.py` might also be relevant.\n3. The specific `ArticleForm` implementation in the project, particularly how the `publications` field is defined and processed upon form submission, could contain the bug or reveal misuse of Django's queryset APIs.\n\nWithout more context or the ability to test the behavior directly, these locations are speculative based on the issue description and the collected context."
