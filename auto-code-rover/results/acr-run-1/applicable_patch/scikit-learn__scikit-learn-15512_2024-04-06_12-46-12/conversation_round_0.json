A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 40.6.3\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.15.4\nscipy: 1.2.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n</issue>"
