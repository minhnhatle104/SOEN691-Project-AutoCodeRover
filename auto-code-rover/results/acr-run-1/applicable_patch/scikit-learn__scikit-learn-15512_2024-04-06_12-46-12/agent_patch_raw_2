```

**Explanation**: This modification ensures that when the `affinity_propagation` function does not lead to convergence, it explicitly returns `cluster_centers_indices` as an empty NumPy array with an integer data type. This change aligns with the expected behavior described in the documentation and the issue report. Additionally, it adds a conditional verbose print statement to provide immediate feedback to the user when the algorithm does not converge, enhancing usability and debuggability.
