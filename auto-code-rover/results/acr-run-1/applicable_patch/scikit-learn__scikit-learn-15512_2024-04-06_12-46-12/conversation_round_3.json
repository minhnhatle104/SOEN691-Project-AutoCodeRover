A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 40.6.3\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.15.4\nscipy: 1.2.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n</issue>"

The `max_iter` parameter is particularly relevant to the issue, as it specifies the maximum number of iterations.\n\n2. **Fit Method**: The `fit` method is responsible for fitting the clustering from features or an affinity matrix. It handles both \"precomputed\" and \"euclidean\" affinities and calculates the `affinity_matrix_`. The crucial part is the call to `affinity_propagation`, which returns `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`.\n\n3. **Convergence Check**: The issue mentions a potential solution to check if the algorithm has converged by comparing `max_iter` with `n_iter_`. However, this is not a reliable method since the algorithm could converge exactly at `max_iter` iterations.\n\n### Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Explicit Convergence Property**: Introduce a new property (e.g., `has_converged_`) that explicitly indicates whether the algorithm has converged. This property could be set based on the conditions checked inside the `affinity_propagation` function.\n\n2. **Adjust Return Values on Non-convergence**: Modify the behavior of the `fit` method or the `affinity_propagation` function to ensure that when the algorithm does not converge, it adheres to the documentation by returning an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `-1` for each label in `labels_`.\n\n3. **Documentation Update**: If the current behavior (returning `[2]` as cluster center and `[0,0,0]` as cluster labels for non-converged cases) is intended, update the documentation to reflect this behavior accurately. However, this seems less likely given the user's expectation and the potential for silent failures.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo proceed with a solution, we need to inspect the `affinity_propagation` function, which seems to be where the decision on convergence is made. Specifically, we should look for how `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_` are determined and any conditions that indicate non-convergence.\n\n- **Search for the `affinity_propagation` function**: This will help us understand how the convergence is determined and how the return values are set based on convergence.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"affinity_propagation\")\n```\n\nThis step is crucial for determining the most appropriate solution to the issue."

        "content": "The `affinity_propagation` function is the core of the Affinity Propagation clustering process, and its analysis provides crucial insights into how the algorithm determines convergence and assigns cluster centers and labels. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n### Key Aspects of `affinity_propagation`\n\n1. **Parameters and Initialization**: The function accepts several parameters, including `S` (similarity matrix), `preference`, `convergence_iter`, `max_iter`, `damping`, and `return_n_iter`. It initializes matrices for responsibilities (`R`) and availabilities (`A`), and a temporary matrix (`tmp`).\n\n2. **Special Cases Handling**: Before the main iteration loop, the function checks for degenerate cases where all samples have equal similarities and preferences. In such cases, it returns early with either a single cluster or each sample as its own cluster, depending on the preference relative to similarities.\n\n3. **Main Iteration Loop**: The algorithm iteratively updates responsibilities and availabilities, applying damping to stabilize the updates. It uses a convergence check based on the number of iterations with no change in the number of estimated clusters.\n\n4. **Convergence Check**: Convergence is assessed by tracking whether the sum of availabilities and responsibilities (`np.diag(A) + np.diag(R)`) is positive over a sliding window of `convergence_iter` iterations. If the algorithm has not converged within `max_iter` iterations, a warning is issued.\n\n5. **Cluster Centers and Labels Assignment**: If the algorithm converges, it identifies exemplars (cluster centers) and assigns each sample to a cluster based on the highest similarity to an exemplar. If it does not converge, it sets all labels to `-1` and returns an empty list for `cluster_centers_indices`.\n\n### Analysis of the Issue\n\nThe user's issue arises when the algorithm does not converge, but instead of returning an empty list for `cluster_centers_indices` and `-1` for all labels as expected, it returns `[2]` and `[0, 0, 0]`, respectively. The function's documentation and code comments state that it should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices` and `-1` for each label in case of non-convergence, which aligns with the user's expectations.\n\n### Potential Causes\n\n1. **Early Convergence Detection**: The algorithm might be detecting convergence or a stable state prematurely due to the specific data or parameters used. This could be related to how the convergence check is implemented.\n\n2. **Handling of Special Cases**: The handling of degenerate cases at the beginning of the function might not apply to the user's scenario, but it's important to ensure that these checks are not incorrectly influencing the outcome in other ways.\n\n3. **Convergence Warning**: The warning issued when the algorithm does not converge (`\"Affinity propagation did not converge, this model will not have any cluster centers.\"`) is a crucial indicator, but it might not be sufficient for programmatic detection of non-convergence in user scripts.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nTo address the issue, we could consider the following:\n\n- **Review and Test Convergence Criteria**: Ensure that the convergence criteria accurately reflect the algorithm's state and do not lead to premature or incorrect convergence detection.\n\n- **Enhance Convergence Indication**: Introduce a more explicit indicator of convergence status (e.g., a `converged_` attribute) that users can check programmatically.\n\n- **Clarify Documentation**: If the observed behavior is indeed correct under certain conditions, clarify the documentation to explain when and why different outcomes might be expected.\n\nGiven the complexity of the `affinity_propagation` function and the specific nature of the issue, any modifications would require careful consideration and testing to avoid unintended consequences."

The number of\n        exemplars, i.e. of clusters, is influenced by the input preferences\n        value. If the preferences are not passed as arguments, they will be\n        set to the median of the input similarities (resulting in a moderate\n        number of clusters). For a smaller amount of clusters, this can be set\n        to the minimum value of the similarities.\n\n    convergence_iter : int, optional, default: 15\n        Number of iterations with no change in the number\n        of estimated clusters that stops the convergence.\n\n    max_iter : int, optional, default: 200\n        Maximum number of iterations\n\n    damping : float, optional, default: 0.5\n        Damping factor between 0.5 and 1.\n\n    copy : boolean, optional, default: True\n        If copy is False, the affinity matrix is modified inplace by the\n        algorithm, for memory efficiency\n\n    verbose : boolean, optional, default: False\n        The verbosity level\n\n    return_n_iter : bool, default False\n        Whether or not to return the number of iterations.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n\n    cluster_centers_indices : array, shape (n_clusters,)\n        index of clusters centers\n\n    labels : array, shape (n_samples,)\n        cluster labels for each point\n\n    n_iter : int\n        number of iterations run. Returned only if `return_n_iter` is\n        set to True.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    For an example, see :ref:`examples/cluster/plot_affinity_propagation.py\n    <sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_affinity_propagation.py>`.\n\n    When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as\n    ``cluster_center_indices`` and ``-1`` as label for each training sample.\n\n    When all training samples have equal similarities and equal preferences,\n    the assignment of cluster centers and labels depends on the preference.\n    If the preference is smaller than the similarities, a single cluster center\n    and label ``0`` for every sample will be returned. Otherwise, every\n    training sample becomes its own cluster center and is assigned a unique\n    label.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    Brendan J.
