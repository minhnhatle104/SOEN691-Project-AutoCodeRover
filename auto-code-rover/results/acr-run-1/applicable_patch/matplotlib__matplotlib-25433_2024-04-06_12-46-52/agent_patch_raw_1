**Explanation**: The issue described involves input to widgets being blocked after the figure is cleared (`clf()`) and redrawn within the `on_changed` callback of a `RangeSlider`. This patch introduces a wrapper for the callback functions connected via `on_changed` and `on_clicked` methods. The wrapper checks if the figure associated with the widget still exists before calling the original callback function. This approach aims to prevent potential issues arising from attempting to interact with widgets that are no longer part of an existing figure, which could be part of the problem leading to blocked input. Note that for this solution to work, it assumes access to the `pyplot.fignum_exists` method and the widget's associated figure, which might require additional context or adjustments based on the actual structure and capabilities of the Matplotlib widgets and figure classes.
