Specifically, we should look into the `on_changed` and `on_clicked` methods, as well as how the figure is cleared and redrawn with `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()`. Given the information provided in the issue, here are the API calls that would be most relevant:\n\n1. Search for the `RangeSlider` class to understand its structure and methods, especially focusing on the `on_changed` method.\n2. Search for the `Button` class to compare its implementation with `RangeSlider`, focusing on the `on_clicked` method.\n3. Search for the `clf` method in the entire codebase to understand how clearing the figure might affect widget input.\n4. Search for the `draw` method in the entire codebase to understand how redrawing the figure might affect widget input.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_class(\"RangeSlider\")`\n- `search_class(\"Button\")`\n- `search_method(\"clf\")`\n- `search_method(\"draw\")`"
