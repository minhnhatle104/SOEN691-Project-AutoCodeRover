            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how the `limit_choices_to` functionality is implemented and used within the ForeignKey field. Given the description of the issue, it seems pertinent to explore the implementation of ForeignKey and any related formfield generation logic that might be affected by `limit_choices_to`. Here are the API calls I would make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ForeignKey\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of the ForeignKey field, especially how it handles the `limit_choices_to` parameter.\n2. `search_method(\"formfield\")`: Since the issue mentions duplicate options in formfield, it's crucial to investigate how formfields are generated from models, particularly those involving ForeignKey fields.\n3. `search_code(\"limit_choices_to\")`: This will provide insight into how and where `limit_choices_to` is being used across the project, which could highlight potential areas where the duplication issue arises."
