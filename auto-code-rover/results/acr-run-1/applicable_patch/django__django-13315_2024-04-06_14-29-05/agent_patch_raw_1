To address the issue of duplicate options in formfields due to `limit_choices_to` on a ForeignKey field, we need to ensure that the queryset used for generating formfield choices is distinct. This can be particularly important when `limit_choices_to` involves a join operation, which can lead to duplicate entries. Here's a proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>def apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield(formfield):
    """Apply limit_choices_to to the formfield's queryset if needed."""
    if hasattr(formfield, 'queryset') and hasattr(formfield, 'get_limit_choices_to'):
        limit_choices_to = formfield.get_limit_choices_to()
        if limit_choices_to is not None:
            formfield.queryset = formfield.queryset.complex_filter(limit_choices_to)</original>
<patched>def apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield(formfield):
    """Apply limit_choices_to to the formfield's queryset if needed, ensuring it's distinct."""
    if hasattr(formfield, 'queryset') and hasattr(formfield, 'get_limit_choices_to'):
        limit_choices_to = formfield.get_limit_choices_to()
        if limit_choices_to is not None:
            formfield.queryset = formfield.queryset.complex_filter(limit_choices_to).distinct()</patched>
```

This modification ensures that whenever `limit_choices_to` is applied to a formfield's queryset, the resulting queryset is made distinct by appending `.distinct()` to it. This should prevent duplicate options from being rendered in formfields that are generated from models with ForeignKey fields using `limit_choices_to` involving joins.

It's important to note that using `.distinct()` can have performance implications, especially on large datasets or complex queries. Therefore, it's recommended to evaluate the impact of this change in environments where performance is a critical concern.

Additionally, thorough testing should be conducted to ensure that this change does not introduce any unintended side effects, especially in cases where the distinctness of the queryset might affect the logic of the application in unexpected ways.
