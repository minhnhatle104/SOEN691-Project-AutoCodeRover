This patch adds a step after sorting the eigenvectors in descending order of their eigenvalues to ensure consistent signs of the eigenvectors across different runs. It does so by determining the sign of the element with the maximum absolute value in each eigenvector and then multiplying each eigenvector by these signs. This approach ensures that the direction of the maximum absolute value in each eigenvector is consistent, thereby addressing the issue of sign differences in the results of `KernelPCA` with the RBF kernel.
