        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered the following context about the issue and the relevant parts of the project:\n\n1. **StaticFilesHandlerMixin**: This mixin class is found within `django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py`. It provides several methods related to handling static files, such as `load_middleware`, `get_base_url`, `_should_handle`, `file_path`, `serve`, and `get_response`. However, there is no mention of an asynchronous method for getting responses, which aligns with the issue reported.\n\n2. **ASGIStaticFilesHandler**: This class also resides in `django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py` and inherits from `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` and `ASGIHandler`. The class is initialized with an application, but based on the search results, it does not implement a `get_response_async` method. This absence is directly related to the traceback error reported in the issue, as the ASGI handler is expected to provide an asynchronous response method.\n\n3. **Search for `get_response_async` in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`**: The search confirmed that the `get_response_async` method is indeed missing from the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class. This missing method is the root cause of the issue, as the Django ASGI handler mechanism expects this method to be present for asynchronous request handling.\n\n4. **Search for `get_response_async` in `/src/django/django/core/handlers/base.py`**: The search did not find the specified file in the codebase, which could be due to an incorrect path or an issue with the search query. However, the mention of this file in the traceback suggests that `get_response_async` is a method expected by Django's core handler logic for processing asynchronous requests.\n\n**Analysis**:\nThe issue stems from the absence of a `get_response_async` method in the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class, which is necessary for handling asynchronous requests in Django's ASGI environment. The traceback error occurs because the Django framework attempts to call this method based on its core ASGI handling logic, but it cannot find it in the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class.\n\n**Next Steps**:\nTo resolve this issue, we need to implement a `get_response_async` method in the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class. This method should provide the necessary logic to asynchronously handle requests for static files, aligning with Django's ASGI handling expectations. The implementation should carefully consider how static files are served in an asynchronous context, possibly reusing logic from the `get_response` method in the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` and adapting it for asynchronous operation."
