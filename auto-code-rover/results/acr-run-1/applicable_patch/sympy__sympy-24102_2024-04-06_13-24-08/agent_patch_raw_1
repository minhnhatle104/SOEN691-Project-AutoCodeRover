Given the context and the issue at hand, the problem seems to stem from the handling of non-ASCII characters, such as Greek letters, during the parsing process. The provided code snippets do not directly show how non-ASCII characters are handled, but the issue likely arises from the regular expressions or the tokenization process not accounting for these characters properly. A comprehensive patch would involve ensuring that these characters are correctly recognized and processed throughout the parsing stages.

However, without specific details on the failure points for non-ASCII character handling, a precise patch cannot be provided. Instead, I will suggest a general approach that could be taken to address the issue, focusing on enhancing the tokenization and parsing process to correctly handle non-ASCII characters.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>tokenizer = self._get_tokenizer()</original>
<patched>import re
tokenizer = self._get_tokenizer()
# Update the tokenizer regular expression to include non-ASCII characters.
# Assuming `_get_tokenizer` returns a regex pattern, we add support for Unicode letters.
self._regex_tokenizer = re.compile(r'[\w\W]', re.UNICODE)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>code_splits.append(["_Str", code[string_start+1:string_end].replace('\\"', '"')])</original>
<patched>code_splits.append(["_Str", code[string_start+1:string_end].replace('\\"', '"').encode('utf-8').decode('unicode_escape')])</patched>
```
This modification assumes that the issue might be related to how string literals containing non-ASCII characters are handled. By encoding and then decoding with 'unicode_escape', we ensure that Unicode characters in string literals are correctly interpreted.

# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>return self._atom_conversions.get(expr, sympify(expr))</original>
<patched>from sympy import Symbol
return self._atom_conversions.get(expr, Symbol(expr) if expr.isalpha() else sympify(expr))</patched>
```
This modification is speculative and aims to ensure that alphabetic expressions, which could include Greek letters, are treated as symbols if they do not match any known conversions. This is a simplistic approach and might need refinement to handle all cases correctly.

Please note, these modifications are based on general insights and assumptions about the potential causes of the issue. Actual implementation might require a deeper investigation into the `MathematicaParser` class and possibly adjustments in several places to fully support parsing of Greek characters and other non-ASCII symbols.
