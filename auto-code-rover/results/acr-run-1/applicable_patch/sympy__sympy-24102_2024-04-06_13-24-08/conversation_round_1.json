        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, here's an analysis of the context around the issue:\n\n1. **Class and Method Context**:\n   - There is no class named `mathematica` found in the codebase, which aligns with the issue description stating that the `mathematica` function (not class) from the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` package is deprecated.\n   - The `parse_mathematica` method exists within the `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` file. This method is intended to translate a string containing a Wolfram Mathematica expression into a SymPy expression.\n\n2. **Functionality of `parse_mathematica`**:\n   - The `parse_mathematica` function supports translating both standard input form and Mathematica full form expressions into SymPy expressions.\n   - It can handle various Mathematica expressions, including functions, operations, and even matrix representations, translating them into their SymPy equivalents.\n   - When the translation into equivalent SymPy expressions fails, the method attempts to create an expression equivalent to Wolfram Mathematica's \"FullForm\", using SymPy `Function` objects as nodes of the syntax tree.\n\n3. **Issue Description**:\n   - The issue at hand is that `parse_mathematica` fails to parse Greek characters (e.g., '\u03bb'), which results in a `SyntaxError`. This is a regression from the deprecated `mathematica` function, which could handle such characters.\n\n4. **Potential Areas to Investigate**:\n   - The parsing logic within `parse_mathematica`, specifically how it handles non-ASCII characters like Greek letters.\n   - The `MathematicaParser` class, which is instantiated and used within `parse_mathematica` to perform the actual parsing. Understanding how this parser is implemented and how it processes input strings could provide insights into why Greek characters are causing issues.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve diving deeper into the `MathematicaParser` class and the parsing logic to identify where the handling of Greek characters (and possibly other non-ASCII characters) fails. This would likely involve examining how the parser tokenizes input strings and whether there are any limitations or assumptions made about character sets that could lead to the observed `SyntaxError`."
