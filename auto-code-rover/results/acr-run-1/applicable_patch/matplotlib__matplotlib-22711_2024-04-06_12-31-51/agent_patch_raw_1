```

This patch removes the lines that attempt to assign values to `xy[4]` in both the "vertical" and "else" (which implies "horizontal") sections of the `set_val` method in the `RangeSlider` class. The removal is based on the IndexError issue reported, where accessing `xy[4]` is out of bounds since `xy` is only initialized with 4 elements. This change aims to prevent the IndexError while maintaining the functionality of setting the slider's value. Further testing would be required to ensure that this modification does not affect the visual representation and functionality of the `RangeSlider` widget in both vertical and horizontal orientations.
