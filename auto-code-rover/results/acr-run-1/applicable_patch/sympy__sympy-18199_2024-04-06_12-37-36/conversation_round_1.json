        "content": "Analyzing the provided context from the `nthroot_mod` function in the `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py` file, we can deduce several key points relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **Function Purpose**: The `nthroot_mod` function is designed to find solutions to the equation \\(x^n = a \\mod p\\), where `a`, `n`, and `p` are integers, with `n` and `p` being positive. The parameter `all_roots` determines whether the function returns just the smallest root or a list of all roots.\n\n2. **Special Cases Handling**: The function has special handling for when `n == 2`, directly calling a `sqrt_mod` function to find square roots modulo `p`. It also checks if `p` is prime and raises a `NotImplementedError` for composite values of `p`.\n\n3. **Roots Calculation**: The function calculates roots based on whether \\((p - 1) \\% n == 0\\) and uses a combination of number theory concepts and algorithms, including extended GCD and modular exponentiation, to find the roots.\n\n4. **Issue Description**: The reported issue is that the function misses a root when `a % p == 0`, specifically, it does not return `0 mod p` as a root, which should be a valid root for such cases.\n\nGiven this context, the solution to the issue would involve modifying the `nthroot_mod` function to check if `a % p == 0` and, if so, include `0` in the list of roots (or return `0` if `all_roots` is `False`). This check should ideally occur early in the function before other more complex calculations are performed, as it represents a simple and special case that can be quickly resolved.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the `nthroot_mod` function to handle this case correctly."
