This patch modifies the `decompose` function in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` to return a list of monomials sorted by their degree when `separate=True`. This addresses the issue of the arbitrary order in the list returned by `list(poly_dict.values())` by explicitly sorting the dictionary keys (which represent the degree of monomials) and then creating a list of the corresponding values. This ensures that the output is consistent across different runs, which should help in resolving the test failures mentioned in the issue.
