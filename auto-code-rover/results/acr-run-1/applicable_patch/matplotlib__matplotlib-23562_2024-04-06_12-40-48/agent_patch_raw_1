```

These modifications ensure that `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` are properly initialized before they are accessed, which should resolve the AttributeError. The first modification directly addresses the issue by initializing `_facecolors2d` in the `get_facecolor` method if it hasn't been initialized yet. The second modification preemptively initializes these attributes in the `do_3d_projection` method to ensure they are always available, aligning with the existing pattern of initializing attributes in this method.
