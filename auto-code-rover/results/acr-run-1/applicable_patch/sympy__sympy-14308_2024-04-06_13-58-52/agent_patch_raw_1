Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem lies in how vector expressions, particularly those involving `CoordSys3D`, are handled during the pretty printing process. However, without specific details on how `CoordSys3D` objects are formatted or any errors in the current implementation, proposing an exact patch is challenging. 

A general approach to address issues like incorrect formatting or baseline alignment in pretty printing would involve enhancing the `pretty` method to better handle vector expressions. This might include adding or modifying logic to ensure that expressions involving vectors are formatted correctly, taking into account their unique structure and the need for correct baseline alignment.

Since the provided code snippet does not directly show how vector expressions are handled, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to improve the handling of such expressions. This approach involves checking if the expression involves a `CoordSys3D` object and applying a custom formatting rule if so.

```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>def pretty(expr, **settings):
    """Returns a string containing the prettified form of expr.

    For information on keyword arguments see pretty_print function.

    """
    pp = PrettyPrinter(settings)

    # XXX: this is an ugly hack, but at least it works
    use_unicode = pp._settings['use_unicode']
    uflag = pretty_use_unicode(use_unicode)

    try:
        return pp.doprint(expr)
    finally:
        pretty_use_unicode(uflag)
</original>
<patched>from sympy.vector import CoordSys3D

def pretty(expr, **settings):
    """Returns a string containing the prettified form of expr.

    For information on keyword arguments see pretty_print function.

    """
    pp = PrettyPrinter(settings)

    # Check if the expression involves a CoordSys3D object and apply custom formatting
    if isinstance(expr, CoordSys3D):
        settings.update({"special_handling_for_CoordSys3D": True})

    # XXX: this is an ugly hack, but at least it works
    use_unicode = pp._settings['use_unicode']
    uflag = pretty_use_unicode(use_unicode)

    try:
        return pp.doprint(expr)
    finally:
        pretty_use_unicode(uflag)
</patched>
```

Please note, the actual implementation of "special_handling_for_CoordSys3D" within the `PrettyPrinter` class and its `doprint` method would need to be developed to address the specific formatting issues with `CoordSys3D` objects. This could involve adjusting the baseline alignment or handling of specific vector components during the pretty printing process. The patch above is illustrative and assumes that additional logic will be implemented within the `PrettyPrinter` class to handle `CoordSys3D` objects according to the new `special_handling_for_CoordSys3D` setting.
