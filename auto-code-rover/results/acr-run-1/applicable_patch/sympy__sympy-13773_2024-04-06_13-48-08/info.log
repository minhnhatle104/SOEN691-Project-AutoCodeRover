This is a simple way to check if the operand can be considered a matrix. If the `other` operand does not have a `shape` attribute, a `ValueError` is raised with a message guiding the user to use the `*` operator for scalar multiplication, aligning the behavior with that of NumPy as described in the issue.\n- This solution assumes that all matrix-like objects that should be valid for matrix multiplication with instances of these classes will have a `shape` attribute. This is a common convention in numerical and scientific computing libraries but might need adjustment if the SymPy project uses or plans to support matrix-like objects without a `shape` attribute.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
