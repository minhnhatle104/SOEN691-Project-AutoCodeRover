The current implementation of `__matmul__` in `MatrixArithmetic` simply delegates to `__mul__`, which does not enforce the requirement that both operands must be matrices for matrix multiplication to proceed. This behavior is inconsistent with how matrix multiplication is expected to work, as demonstrated by the comparison with NumPy's behavior in the issue description.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve modifying the `__matmul__` method in both `MatrixArithmetic` and possibly `MatrixExpr` classes to include checks that ensure both operands are matrix-like objects before proceeding with the multiplication. If one of the operands is not a matrix, the method should raise an appropriate exception, similar to the behavior observed in NumPy.\n\nBefore proceeding with drafting a patch, it might be beneficial to review the current implementations of `__mul__` in both classes to understand how multiplication is currently handled and to ensure that any changes made to `__matmul__` are consistent with the overall design of the matrix classes in SymPy. However, based on the information provided, we have enough context to start drafting a solution for the `MatrixArithmetic` class's `__matmul__` method."
