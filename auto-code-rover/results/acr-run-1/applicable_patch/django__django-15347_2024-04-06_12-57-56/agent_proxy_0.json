            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` classes handle the serialization and deserialization of the `extra_tags` attribute. Specifically, we need to look into how these classes check for the truthiness of `extra_tags` and potentially adjust this logic to differentiate between an empty string and `None`. \n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. **Search for the `Message` class**: This will help us understand the structure of the message object, especially how `extra_tags` is defined and handled.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Message\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `MessageEncoder` class**: This will provide insight into how messages are serialized, particularly how `extra_tags` is processed during serialization.\n   \n   `search_class(\"MessageEncoder\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `MessageDecoder` class**: This will help us understand the deserialization process, especially how `extra_tags` is reconstructed from the serialized data.\n   \n   `search_class(\"MessageDecoder\")`\n\n4. **Search for the encoding method within `MessageEncoder`**: Since the issue occurs during serialization, we need to examine the specific method responsible for encoding the message.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"encode\", \"MessageEncoder\")`\n\n5. **Search for the decoding method within `MessageDecoder`**: Similarly, we need to inspect how the message is decoded, focusing on how `extra_tags` is handled.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"decode\", \"MessageDecoder\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive view of how messages are serialized and deserialized, and how `extra_tags` is treated throughout this process. With this information, we can then proceed to develop a patch that ensures `extra_tags` retains its value as an empty string instead of being converted to `None`."
