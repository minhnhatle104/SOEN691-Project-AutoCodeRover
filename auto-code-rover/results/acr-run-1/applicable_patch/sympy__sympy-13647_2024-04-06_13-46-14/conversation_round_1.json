        "content": "Based on the information collected, the `col_insert` method is defined within the `MatrixShaping` class in the file `sympy/matrices/common.py`. This method is designed to insert one or more columns into a matrix at a specified column position. The provided example in the documentation demonstrates its basic usage, which aligns with the issue described.\n\nThe method starts by handling edge cases, such as inserting into a null matrix (a matrix with no elements), and adjusting the position if it's specified as a negative number (which is a common Python idiom for indexing from the end). It also ensures that the position does not exceed the current number of columns in the matrix.\n\nA key part of the method is the check to ensure that the number of rows in the matrix (`self`) and the matrix to be inserted (`other`) are the same. If they are not, a `ShapeError` is raised. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the matrix's shape.\n\nFinally, the actual insertion is handled by `_eval_col_insert(pos, other)`, which is likely a method that performs the low-level operations to modify the matrix. This method is not directly visible in the provided code snippet, but it's where the insertion logic is implemented.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem seems to occur when inserting columns into a matrix, where the resulting matrix does not match the expected output. Specifically, the identity matrix portion is incorrectly positioned after the insertion operation. This suggests that the issue might lie in how `_eval_col_insert` handles the insertion, particularly with how it rearranges or fails to rearrange existing columns and rows.\n\nTo proceed with diagnosing and fixing the issue, we would need to look into the implementation of `_eval_col_insert` within the `MatrixShaping` class or wherever it is defined. This would help us understand the internal logic for column insertion and identify where the logic might be going wrong in relation to the issue described."
