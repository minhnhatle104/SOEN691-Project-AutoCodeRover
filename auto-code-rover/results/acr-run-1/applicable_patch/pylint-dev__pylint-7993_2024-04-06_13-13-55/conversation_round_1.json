The error message originates from `text.py`, specifically within a method that handles the message template argument. Given this information, the following API calls will be useful to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"text.py\", \"UserWarning\")` - This will help us find where the warning is raised in `text.py` and understand the conditions that lead to it.\n2. `search_code(\"--msg-template\")` - This will help us find all occurrences of how the `--msg-template` argument is processed or referenced in the codebase, which might give us insights into why the custom braces are not working as expected in the newer version.\n3. `search_class(\"TextReporter\")` - Since the issue seems to be related to how messages are reported and the file `text.py` is mentioned, it's plausible that a class like `TextReporter` (or similarly named) could be responsible for handling message templates. This search will help us identify the relevant class and its methods for further investigation.\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."

        "content": "Based on the results from the API calls, we have the following information relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **UserWarning in `text.py`**: The search for `UserWarning` in `text.py` did not yield any results. This suggests that the specific warning message might be generated through a different mechanism than directly calling `UserWarning`, or the initial description of the problem might have referred to a generic warning mechanism rather than a specific method.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `--msg-template`**: The `--msg-template` argument is referenced in several files:\n   - `pylint/epylint.py`\n   - `pylint/reporters/text.py` (2 matches)\n   - `tests/test_epylint.py` (2 matches)\n   \n   This indicates that the handling of the `--msg-template` argument is spread across different parts of the Pylint codebase, including its core functionality (`epylint.py`, `text.py`) and tests (`test_epylint.py`). The multiple occurrences in `text.py` suggest that this file is a key area for understanding how message templates are processed.\n\n3. **`TextReporter` class**: The `TextReporter` class in `pylint/reporters/text.py` is likely responsible for formatting and outputting messages based on the provided template. The class methods such as `write_message`, `handle_message`, and `_display` could be involved in processing the `--msg-template` argument and generating the output. The `line_format` attribute shows the default message format, which is customizable via the `--msg-template` argument.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around how the `TextReporter` class and possibly other parts of the code handle the `--msg-template` argument, particularly in how custom braces are interpreted between versions. The change in behavior from Pylint 1.7.4 to 2.12.2 suggests that there might have been modifications in the message formatting or template processing logic that no longer support the custom brace syntax as expected.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, it would be beneficial to:\n- Examine the changes in `text.py`, especially around the `TextReporter` class methods that could affect message template processing.\n- Review the implementation details in `epylint.py` and `tests/test_epylint.py` for any changes or tests related to the `--msg-template` functionality between the two versions.\n- Investigate if there were any changes in how custom braces or template arguments are parsed and processed in the newer version of Pylint.\n\nThis analysis should provide a clearer understanding of why the custom braces in the message template do not work as expected in Pylint 2.12.2."
