Given the information provided in the issue, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"syndication.views\")`: To get an overview of the `syndication.views` class where the `feed.add_item()` method is presumably located.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"add_item\", \"syndication.views\")`: To find the implementation details of the `add_item` method within the `syndication.views` class.\n3. `search_code(\"item_extra_kwargs\")`: To understand how `item_extra_kwargs` is currently used to work around the lack of direct `comments` support.\n4. `search_code(\"feedparser\")`: Since the issue mentions that `comments` is explicitly mentioned in the feedparser but not implemented in the view, this search will help understand the current handling of `comments` in the feedparser context."
