Specifically, we need to understand how it's currently implemented to identify where and how to add the logging for exceptions. Therefore, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"send_robust\")`: This will help us find where the `send_robust` method is defined in the codebase, which is crucial for understanding its current behavior and how it handles exceptions.\n\n2. `search_class(\"Signal\")`: Since the method `send_robust` is a part of the `Signal` class, getting more context about the `Signal` class itself might provide additional insights into how it's designed and how methods like `send_robust` fit into its overall functionality. \n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue and formulating a patch."
