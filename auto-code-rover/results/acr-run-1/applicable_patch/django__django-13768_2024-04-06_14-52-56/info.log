The `send_robust` method is designed to send a signal from a sender to all connected receivers, catching and returning errors raised by any receiver as part of the response list. This method iterates over all live receivers, invoking each one and catching exceptions that occur, appending either the exception or the receiver's response to the `responses` list, which is then returned.\n\nThe `Signal` class itself contains several other methods related to signal handling, such as `connect`, `disconnect`, `send`, and internal utility methods like `_clear_dead_receivers` and `_live_receivers`. The `send_robust` method is specifically designed to handle errors more gracefully than the `send` method, by ensuring that an error from one receiver does not prevent other receivers from being notified.\n\nGiven this context, to address the issue of logging exceptions handled in `send_robust`, we need to focus on the exception handling part of the `send_robust` method. The goal is to add a logging statement within the `except` block that catches the exceptions, to log these exceptions using `logger.exception()` or a similar logging call. This will ensure that exceptions raised by receivers during the `send_robust` operation are logged, making them visible in error handling tools like Sentry.\n\nThe key steps to address the issue will involve:\n1. Identifying the appropriate logging level and message format for logging the exceptions.\n2. Modifying the `except` block within the `send_robust` method to include a call to log the exception, ensuring that the logging captures enough context about the exception and the receiver that raised it.\n3. Ensuring that the logging does not interfere with the existing functionality of returning the exception instance as part of the response list.\n\nNext, we will formulate a patch to implement these steps.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
