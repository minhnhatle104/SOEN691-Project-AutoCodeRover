However, based on the provided search results and the description of the issue, the location within the `send_robust` method where exceptions are caught and handled is already identified in the provided code snippet. The \"buggy\" location, in this context, refers to where the enhancement (adding logging for exceptions) should be made rather than a traditional bug. \n\nThe specific part of the method that needs modification is within the `except Exception as err:` block of the `send_robust` method. This is where exceptions from receivers are caught, and this is precisely where logging should be added to capture these exceptions.\n\nTherefore, no further context from the project is needed at this point, as the task involves enhancing the existing exception handling in the `send_robust` method by adding logging functionality to it. The provided information is sufficient to proceed with drafting a solution."
