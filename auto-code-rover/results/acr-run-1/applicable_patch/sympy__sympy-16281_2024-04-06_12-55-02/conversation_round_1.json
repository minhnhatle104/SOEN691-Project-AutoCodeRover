Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we have identified the `Product` class within the `sympy/concrete/products.py` file. This class is part of the SymPy library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. The `Product` class represents the product of a sequence of terms, and it inherits from `ExprWithIntLimits`, indicating it involves expressions with integral limits.\n\nThe issue reported is related to the pretty-printing (pprint) of the `Product` object. However, the search for a method named `pprint` directly within the codebase did not yield any results. This suggests that the pretty-printing functionality for `Product` objects might not be implemented within the `Product` class itself but rather handled by a more general pretty-printing mechanism in SymPy, possibly within a separate pretty-printing module or system that handles various types of expressions.\n\nGiven that the `pprint` method was not found directly, it's likely that the pretty-printing functionality is part of SymPy's general output formatting system, which is designed to work with different mathematical objects and expressions. The issue description suggests improvements to how `Product` objects are displayed, specifically regarding the layout and appearance of the pretty-printed output.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to locate where the pretty-printing logic for `Product` objects is implemented within SymPy. Since the direct search for `pprint` was unsuccessful, we should look into the modules or systems responsible for output formatting and pretty-printing in SymPy. This could involve searching for modules or functions related to pretty-printing or output formatting in general, rather than a method specifically named `pprint` within the `Product` class.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve:\n1. Identifying the module or system in SymPy responsible for pretty-printing or output formatting.\n2. Understanding how this system decides to format `Product` objects.\n3. Making the necessary adjustments to the formatting logic to address the issues described, such as adjusting the layout to remove the extra line, making the \u220f symbol less wide, and possibly extending the top bar for a more balanced appearance.\n\nTo proceed, we might need to search for modules or functions related to pretty-printing in SymPy, such as those handling general expression formatting or specifically designed for formatting expressions with integral limits like `Product`."
