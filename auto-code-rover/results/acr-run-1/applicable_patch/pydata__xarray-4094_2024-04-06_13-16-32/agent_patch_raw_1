Explanation:
The patch addresses the issue where unstacking a stacked `DataArray` could lead to a `MergeError` due to dimensionality conflicts, especially when the original variables had a single dimension. The original code simply selected the variable and squeezed it, potentially dropping dimensions that were originally present. The patched version ensures that dimensions that were originally single-dimensioned are retained in the dataset after unstacking. This is achieved by keeping track of the dimensions that are not present in the selection but were part of the original `DataArray`'s dimensions, and explicitly setting these dimensions on the squeezed selection. This approach should help maintain the original structure of the dataset, avoiding conflicts during the merge operation that creates the unstacked `Dataset`.
