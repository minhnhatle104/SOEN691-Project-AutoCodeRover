        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered significant context regarding the issue at hand. Let's break down the findings:\n\n1. **ManyToManyRel Class**:\n   - Found in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`, the `ManyToManyRel` class is a subclass of `ForeignObjectRel`. It has an `__init__` method that accepts several parameters, including `through_fields`. This is crucial because the issue mentions that `through_fields` can be a list and lacks a `make_hashable` call.\n   - The second occurrence of `ManyToManyRel` in `tests/invalid_models_tests/test_relative_fields.py` seems to be part of the test suite and not directly relevant to the issue.\n\n2. **make_hashable Method**:\n   - Located in `django/utils/hashable.py`, the `make_hashable` function attempts to make a given value hashable. It handles dictionaries by converting them into sorted tuples, iterables by converting them into tuples of hashable items, and directly returns hashable values. This function is essential for making `through_fields` hashable if it's a list, as mentioned in the issue.\n\n3. **Usage of make_hashable**:\n   - The `make_hashable` function is used across various parts of Django, including model base classes, lookups, expressions, and SQL compiler classes. This widespread use underscores its importance in ensuring that various components can be hashed, particularly for comparison and caching purposes.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from the fact that `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel` is not being processed through `make_hashable`, leading to a `TypeError` when Django attempts to hash it, especially in scenarios involving proxy models. The solution would involve modifying the `ManyToManyRel` class to ensure that `through_fields` is passed through `make_hashable` to make it hashable, similar to how other parts of Django handle potentially unhashable inputs.\n\nThe next step would be to draft a patch for the `ManyToManyRel` class in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`, specifically in its `identity` property or the `__init__` method, to incorporate `make_hashable` for `through_fields`. This would align with how Django generally ensures components are hashable across its framework."
