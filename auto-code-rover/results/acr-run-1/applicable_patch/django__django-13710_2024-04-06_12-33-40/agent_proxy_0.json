Specifically, we should look into the classes and methods that handle these attributes to understand the current implementation and identify where changes are needed to implement the proposed behavior. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **Search for the Inline class in Django admin**: This will help us understand how Inline classes are defined and where `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are handled.\n   - `search_class(\"Inline\")`\n\n2. **Search for methods that handle `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural`**: Since the issue mentions that `verbose_name_plural` should be based on `verbose_name` if specified, we need to find where these attributes are processed or set.\n   - `search_method(\"get_verbose_name\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_verbose_name_plural\")`\n\n3. **Search for code snippets that deal with `verbose_name_plural`**: This will help us find where the default behavior for setting `verbose_name_plural` is implemented, which we need to modify according to the issue.\n   - `search_code(\"verbose_name_plural\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are currently handled within Django's admin Inline classes and point us towards the areas of the code that need modification to implement the proposed feature."
