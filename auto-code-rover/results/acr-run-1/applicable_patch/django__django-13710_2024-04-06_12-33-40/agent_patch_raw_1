<original>        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural</original>
<patched>        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            if self.verbose_name is not None:
                self.verbose_name_plural = f"{self.verbose_name}s"
            else:
                self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural</patched>
```

This patch modifies the `__init__` method of the `InlineModelAdmin` class to set the `verbose_name_plural` based on the `verbose_name` if it is specified and `verbose_name_plural` is not. This approach uses a simple pluralization method by appending an "s" to the `verbose_name`. For more complex pluralization rules, a more sophisticated method may be required, possibly utilizing Django's existing pluralization utilities.
