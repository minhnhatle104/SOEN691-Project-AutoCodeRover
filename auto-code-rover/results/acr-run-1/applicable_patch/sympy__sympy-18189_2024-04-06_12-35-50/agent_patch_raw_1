Explanation:
The original code block attempts to reorder the solutions based on the `syms` parameter but does so incorrectly by returning early if `syms` does not match `var` exactly. This can lead to inconsistent results when `permute=True` is used, as the permutation logic is not applied after reordering. The patched version fixes this by:
1. Checking if the set of symbols in `syms` matches the set of symbols in `var` to ensure all symbols are considered, regardless of order.
2. Sorting `var` based on the order of symbols in `syms`, while ensuring symbols not in `syms` are placed at the end.
3. Correctly passing the `permute` parameter to the recursive call to `diophantine`, ensuring that permutation logic is applied after reordering.
