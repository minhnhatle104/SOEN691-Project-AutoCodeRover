    if 'Content-Length' in req.headers and 'Content-Length' not in prepared_request.headers:
        prepared_request.headers['Content-Length'] = req.headers['Content-Length']

```

This modification addresses the issue by ensuring that after the first redirect, the request object being copied is the one from the most recent response (`resp.request`) rather than the original request (`req`). This way, if a redirect (like a 303 See Other) modifies the request method, this change is preserved in subsequent redirects. Additionally, it ensures that the `Content-Length` header and the request body are preserved from the original request if they are not explicitly modified by the redirection response. This approach maintains the integrity of the request while correctly handling the HTTP method across redirects.
