        "content": "The issue described involves the `Session.resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, which is part of the `requests` library. The problem arises during the handling of HTTP redirection chains, specifically when a POST request is redirected with a 303 See Other response, which should convert the request method to GET. However, if the next redirection uses a 307 Temporary Redirect, the method should remain as GET, but the current implementation incorrectly reverts it back to POST.\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the method's behavior of copying the _original_ request object for each iteration of redirection. This behavior fails to account for changes in the request method due to specific redirection responses (like 303 See Other) that should alter the request method for all subsequent requests.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant parts of the `resolve_redirects` method based on the provided code snippet:\n\n1. **Copying the original request**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` is executed at the beginning of each redirection loop iteration. This step is where the method fails to account for changes in the request method due to previous redirections.\n\n2. **Method change for 303 See Other**: The code correctly identifies that a 303 See Other response should change the request method to GET unless the original method was HEAD. However, because the original request is copied for each redirection, this change is not preserved if another redirection follows.\n\n3. **Method preservation logic**: The method lacks explicit logic to preserve the changed request method (to GET) in case of subsequent redirections like 307 Temporary Redirect, which expects the method to remain unchanged from the one resulting from the 303 See Other response.\n\nTo address this issue, a patch needs to ensure that changes to the request method during redirection handling are preserved across all subsequent redirections. This might involve modifying how the request object is copied or updated during the redirection handling process, ensuring that method changes are carried forward correctly."
