```

This patch modifies the `__init__` method of the `Request` class to handle the `hooks` argument more flexibly. Specifically, it checks if the value associated with each event in the `hooks` dictionary is a list. If it is, it iterates over this list and registers each hook function individually. If not, it proceeds to register the hook as before. This change allows users to pass a list of hook functions for each event, addressing the issue described.
