This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the `Request` class, its `__init__` method, and the `register_hook` method, we can analyze the current implementation and identify how it relates to the issue described.\n\n### Analysis of the `Request` Class\n\n- **Initialization (`__init__` method)**: The `Request` class initializes several attributes, including `hooks`, which is particularly relevant to the issue. During initialization, `hooks` is set to an empty dictionary. Then, for each event in a predefined list of hooks (`HOOKS`), it initializes an empty list: `self.hooks[event] = []`. This setup suggests that the design expects multiple hooks per event, as it prepares a list to hold them.\n\n- **Registering Hooks (`register_hook` method)**: The `register_hook` method appends the provided `hook` to the list of hooks for the specified `event`. This method supports the idea of having multiple hooks per event since it appends the new hook to the existing list without replacing it.\n\n### Analysis of the Issue\n\nThe issue describes a problem where passing a list of hook functions for a single hook event in the `hooks` argument of the `Request` constructor does not work as expected. Instead of recognizing the list as multiple hooks to be registered, the current implementation wraps this list in another list. This behavior is likely due to how the `hooks` argument is processed in the `__init__` method. Specifically, the loop that iterates over the `hooks` dictionary items and calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` does not account for `v` being a list of functions. It treats `v` as a single hook function, leading to the described problem.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nTo resolve this issue, the processing of the `hooks` argument in the `__init__` method needs to be adjusted to check if the value `v` for each key-value pair in the `hooks` dictionary is a list. If it is a list, the code should iterate over this list and register each hook function individually. If not, it should proceed to register the single hook function as it currently does.\n\nThis approach would allow users to pass a list of hook functions for each event in the `hooks` argument, aligning with the expectation set by the initialization of `self.hooks[event] = []` and the implementation of the `register_hook` method, which supports multiple hooks per event.\n\nNext, I will provide a patch to implement this solution."
