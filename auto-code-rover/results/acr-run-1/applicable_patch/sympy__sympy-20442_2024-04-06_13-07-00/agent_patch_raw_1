**Explanation:**

The patch addresses the issue where `convert_to` might return unexpected results when converting between units that do not directly align with each other, as demonstrated by the original issue with converting `J*s` to `joule`. The original code simply returns the expression if the dependency matrix (`depmat`) is `None`, indicating that no direct conversion could be found. However, this behavior can lead to unintuitive results, such as `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected `kg*m**2/s`.

The patched version adds a check to see if the dependency matrix is either `None` or effectively does nothing (all powers are zero, indicating no conversion). In such cases, it attempts to convert the expression to base units first and then tries the conversion again. This intermediate step should help in cases where a direct conversion isn't possible but a two-step conversion (original units -> base units -> target units) is feasible.

The `try-except` block ensures that if any part of this new process fails (for example, if converting to base units is not possible for some reason), the function will still return the original expression gracefully, preserving the original method's behavior in scenarios where the new approach does not apply.

This solution aims to improve the intuitiveness and reliability of unit conversions in SymPy without introducing breaking changes or significantly altering the method's expected behavior.
