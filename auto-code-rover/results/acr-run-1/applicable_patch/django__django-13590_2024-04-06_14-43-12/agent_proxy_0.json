            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation of `resolve_lookup_value` in the Django codebase, specifically how it handles named tuples when used with `__range` queryset filters. Given the information in the issue, we will focus on the `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` class and its `resolve_lookup_value` method. Additionally, we'll look for how named tuples are being reconstituted, which seems to be the root cause of the problem.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to get the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Query\")`: This will help us find the file or files where the `Query` class is defined, which is part of `django.db.models.sql`.\n   \n2. `search_method_in_class(\"resolve_lookup_value\", \"Query\")`: With this, we aim to find the implementation details of the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class to understand how it processes tuples and named tuples.\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient information to start formulating a patch for the described issue."
