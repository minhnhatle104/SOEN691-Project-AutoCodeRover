This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n</issue>"

This class is a central part of Django's ORM system, responsible for constructing the SQL queries based on the queryset operations performed in Django models.\n\n### Method Context\nThe `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class is specifically designed to handle the resolution of lookup values. This method is crucial for understanding the issue at hand because it directly deals with the values passed to queryset filters, including handling iterables like lists and tuples.\n\n### Issue Analysis\nThe error described in the issue occurs when a named tuple is passed as an argument to a range queryset filter. The `resolve_lookup_value` method has logic to handle iterables (lists and tuples) by iterating over their items and resolving each item independently. However, when it attempts to reconstitute the iterable (in this case, a named tuple), it does so by calling the type's constructor with an iterator of the resolved items. This approach works for regular tuples but fails for named tuples because named tuples expect their fields to be passed as separate arguments, not as a single iterator.\n\n### Problematic Code Snippet\n```python\nelif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n    # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need\n    # to be resolved independently.\n    return type(value)(\n        self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n        for sub_value in value\n    )\n```\nThe issue arises in the above code snippet, where `type(value)(...)` attempts to create a new instance of the iterable's type (a named tuple in this case) with an iterator, which is incompatible with named tuple's constructor expectations.\n\n### Solution Direction\nTo address this issue, a check needs to be added to handle named tuples differently from regular tuples and lists. Specifically, when dealing with a named tuple, the resolved items should be expanded into the constructor using the `*` operator, ensuring that each item is passed as a separate argument.\n\nThe next step would be to draft a patch that incorporates this solution into the `resolve_lookup_value` method, ensuring compatibility with both named tuples and regular tuples/lists."
