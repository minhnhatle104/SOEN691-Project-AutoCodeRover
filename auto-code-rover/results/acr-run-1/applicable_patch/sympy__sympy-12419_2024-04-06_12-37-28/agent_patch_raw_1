Based on the provided context and the identified potential issue in the `Sum` class's `doit` method, a patch could address the incorrect evaluation of the total sum of elements in an identity matrix. The issue seems to stem from how the sum of matrix elements is calculated, especially under certain assumptions like orthogonality. The provided `doit` method does not show an explicit handling for identity matrices, which could lead to incorrect evaluations.

Given the nature of the issue, a direct patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of `eval_sum` and how it interacts with matrix expressions, especially identity matrices. However, a hypothetical patch could involve adding a check to see if the matrix is an identity matrix and, if so, ensuring that the sum of its elements is correctly evaluated as the trace of the matrix.

Since the actual implementation details of `eval_sum` and the handling of identity matrices are not provided, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/concrete/summations.py</file>
<original>
if self.function.is_Matrix:
    return self.expand().doit()
</original>
<patched>
if self.function.is_Matrix:
    # Check if the matrix is an identity matrix
    if self.function.is_Identity:
        # Directly return the sum of diagonal elements for an identity matrix
        return Sum(self.function[i, i], (i, 0, self.function.rows-1)).doit()
    else:
        return self.expand().doit()
</patched>
```

This patch is speculative and assumes the existence of an `is_Identity` property or method that can be used to check if a matrix is an identity matrix. It also assumes that the matrix has a `rows` attribute to determine its size. The idea is to directly calculate the sum of diagonal elements if the matrix is identified as an identity matrix, which should correctly evaluate to `n` for an `n x n` identity matrix.

Please note that this patch is illustrative and may not directly apply to the actual SymPy codebase without modifications. Further investigation and testing would be required to implement a robust solution.
