SymPy successfully recognized that the result is an identity matrix.  I tested its identity-ness by element-wise, queries, and sum of the diagonal elements and received expected results.\nHowever, when I attempt to evaluate the total sum of the elements the result was 0 while 'n' is expected.\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nfrom sympy import Q as Query\nn = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\ni, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\nM = MatrixSymbol('M', n, n)\ne = None\nwith assuming(Query.orthogonal(M)):\ne = refine((M.T * M).doit())\n# Correct: M.T * M is an identity matrix.\nprint(e, e[0, 0], e[0, 1], e[1, 0], e[1, 1])\n# Correct: The output is True True\nprint(ask(Query.diagonal(e)), ask(Query.integer_elements(e)))\n# Correct: The sum of the diagonal elements is n\nprint(Sum(e[i, i], (i, 0, n-1)).doit())\n# So far so good\n# Total sum of the elements is expected to be 'n' but the answer is 0!\nprint(Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())\n```\n</issue>"
