The issue seems to arise when attempting to use `FilteredRelation` in conjunction with `select_related` for multi-level relationships, leading to an incorrect related object being set.\n\nGiven the information in the issue, let's start by gathering more context about the classes and methods involved:\n\n1. Search for the `PoolStyle` class to understand its structure and relationships.\n2. Search for the `FilteredRelation` method or class to understand how it's supposed to work.\n3. Search for the `select_related` method to see how it's implemented or used in the codebase, especially in conjunction with `FilteredRelation`.\n4. Since the test case is added to `ExistingRelatedInstancesTests`, search for this class to see other related tests and how they are structured.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"PoolStyle\")\nsearch_method(\"FilteredRelation\")\nsearch_method(\"select_related\")\nsearch_class(\"ExistingRelatedInstancesTests\")\n```"
