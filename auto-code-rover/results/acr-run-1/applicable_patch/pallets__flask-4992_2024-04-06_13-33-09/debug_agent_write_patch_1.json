        "content": "<issue>Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()\nPython 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\n```\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\n```\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\n```\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\n```python\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\napp.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\n```\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, we have the implementation details of the `Config` class and the `from_file` method within it, located in `src/flask/config.py`. Here's a summary of the key points relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n### `Config` Class\n- The `Config` class in Flask extends the Python dictionary and is used to store configuration variables for a Flask application.\n- It provides several methods for loading configuration settings from various sources, such as environment variables, Python files, and generic files through the `from_file` method.\n\n### `from_file` Method\n- The `from_file` method is designed to update the configuration from a file, using a specified loader function (`load` parameter) that takes a file handle and returns a mapping of the loaded data.\n- The method constructs the full path to the configuration file by joining the `root_path` of the application with the provided `filename`.\n- It then attempts to open the file in text mode (default mode for `open()` in Python) and passes the file handle to the loader function.\n- If the file does not exist or is a directory (and the `silent` parameter is set to `True`), it silently fails by returning `False`. Otherwise, it raises an `OSError`.\n- The data loaded by the `load` function is then passed to the `from_mapping` method to update the application's configuration.\n\n### Issue Analysis\nThe issue arises because the `tomllib.load()` function, introduced in Python 3.11 for loading TOML files, requires the file to be opened in binary mode (`'rb'`), whereas the `from_file` method opens the file in text mode by default. This discrepancy leads to a `TypeError` when attempting to use `tomllib.load()` directly with `from_file`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nTo resolve this issue, we need to modify the `from_file` method to accept an optional file mode parameter, allowing users to specify the mode in which the file should be opened. This change would enable compatibility with loaders like `tomllib.load()` that require binary mode, enhancing the flexibility of the `from_file` method for loading configuration files in various formats.\n\nNext steps will involve drafting a patch to implement this solution in the `from_file` method."
