Given the context and the issue described, it seems that the `refine` function does not properly handle the simplification of `Piecewise` expressions under certain assumptions, particularly for functions like `arg`. The issue might be due to the lack of specific handling for these cases in the refinement process. However, without explicit details on the incorrect behavior or the expected results, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. 

A general approach to address such issues could involve enhancing the `_eval_refine` method for `Piecewise` expressions or adding specific handlers for functions like `arg` under certain assumptions. Below is a hypothetical patch that introduces a handler for `arg` within `Piecewise` expressions when the assumption `Q.positive` is applied. This is a speculative solution and might not directly apply without further context and testing.

<file>sympy/assumptions/refine.py</file>

if handler is None:
    return expr
new_expr = handler(expr, assumptions)
</original>
<patched>
if handler is None:
    # Attempt to refine Piecewise expressions with specific functions like arg
    if isinstance(expr, Piecewise):
        new_expr = _refine_piecewise_under_assumptions(expr, assumptions)
    else:
        return expr
else:
    new_expr = handler(expr, assumptions)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python

# At the end of the file, before the last line.

<patched>
def _refine_piecewise_under_assumptions(expr, assumptions):
    """
    Attempt to refine Piecewise expressions under given assumptions.
    This is a speculative handler and might need adjustments.
    """
    new_args = []
    for e, cond in expr.args:
        if assumptions == Q.positive and isinstance(e, Function) and e.func == arg:
            # Simplify arg under positive assumption, this is a placeholder
            # Actual simplification logic should be implemented based on the mathematical properties
            new_e = e.args[0]  # This is a speculative simplification
        else:
            new_e = refine(e, assumptions)
        new_args.append((new_e, cond))
    return Piecewise(*new_args)
</patched>
```

This patch introduces a speculative mechanism to handle refinement of `Piecewise` expressions with specific functions like `arg` under certain assumptions. The actual implementation of `_refine_piecewise_under_assumptions` and the simplification logic for `arg` would need to be developed based on the mathematical properties and the expected behavior. 

Please note, this solution is based on a general understanding of the issue and might require adjustments or further development to address the specific problem accurately. Testing and validation against the described issue and expected outcomes are crucial before integrating such changes into the codebase.
