2024-04-06 13:36:45 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `pytest.raises` context manager is implemented and how it handles exceptions. Specifically, we\'re interested in how it stores the exception information and why calling `str()` on the context variable does not return the full exception message, unlike a normal exception catch block.\n\nGiven this, we should look into the implementation of the `pytest.raises` context manager and any related exception handling mechanisms within pytest. Here are the API calls that would be most relevant:\n\n1. `search_class("RaisesContext")`: Since the issue involves the behavior of a context manager, it\'s likely implemented as a class. We\'re guessing the name here; if this doesn\'t return relevant results, we may need to adjust our search based on common naming conventions in pytest.\n\n2. `search_method("raises")`: This will help us find the implementation of the `pytest.raises` method itself, which should lead us to how the context manager is initialized and how it handles exceptions.\n\n3. `search_code("with pytest.raises(LookupError) as e")`: This will help us find examples or tests within the pytest codebase that use `pytest.raises`, which might give us clues on the intended usage and any related documentation or comments explaining its behavior.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue and formulating a patch.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

See :ref:`the deprecation docs <raises message deprecated>` for a workaround.\n\n    .. currentmodule:: _pytest._code\n\n    Use ``pytest.raises`` as a context manager, which will capture the exception of the given\n    type::\n\n        >>> with raises(ZeroDivisionError):\n        ...    1/0\n\n    If the code block does not raise the expected exception (``ZeroDivisionError`` in the example\n    above), or no exception at all, the check will fail instead.\n\n    You can also use the keyword argument ``match`` to assert that the\n    exception matches a text or regex::\n\n        >>> with raises(ValueError, match=\'must be 0 or None\'):\n        ...     raise ValueError("value must be 0 or None")\n\n        >>> with raises(ValueError, match=r\'must be \\d+$\'):\n        ...     raise ValueError("value must be 42")\n\n    The context manager produces an :class:`ExceptionInfo` object which can be used to inspect the\n    details of the captured exception::\n\n        >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n        ...     raise ValueError("value must be 42")\n        >>> assert exc_info.type is ValueError\n        >>> assert exc_info.value.args[0] == "value must be 42"\n\n    .. deprecated:: 4.1\n\n        In the context manager form you may use the keyword argument\n        ``message`` to specify a custom failure message that will be displayed\n        in case the ``pytest.raises`` check fails. This has been deprecated as it\n        is considered error prone as users often mean to use ``match`` instead.\n        See :ref:`the deprecation docs <raises message deprecated>` for a workaround.\n\n    .. note::\n\n       When using ``pytest.raises`` as a context manager, it\'s worthwhile to\n       note that normal context manager rules apply and that the exception\n       raised *must* be the final line in the scope of the context manager.\n       Lines of code after that, within the scope of the context manager will\n       not be executed. For example::\n\n           >>> value = 15\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError("value must be <= 10")\n           ...     assert exc_info.type is ValueError  # this will not execute\n\n       Instead, the following approach must be taken (note the difference in\n       scope)::\n\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError("value must be <= 10")\n           ...\n           >>> assert exc_info.type is ValueError\n\n    **Using with** ``pytest.mark.parametrize``\n\n    When using :ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize ref`\n    it is possible to parametrize tests such that\n    some runs raise an exception and others do not.\n\n    See :ref:`parametrizing_conditional_raising` for an example.\n\n    **Legacy form**\n\n    It is possible to specify a callable by passing a to-be-called lambda::\n\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, lambda: 1/0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    or you can specify an arbitrary callable with arguments::\n\n        >>> def f(x): return 1/x\n        ...\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, 0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, x=0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    The form above is fully supported but discouraged for new code because the\n    context manager form is regarded as more readable and less error-prone.\n\n    .. note::\n        Similar to caught exception objects in Python, explicitly clearing\n        local references to returned ``ExceptionInfo`` objects can\n        help the Python interpreter speed up its garbage collection.\n\n        Clearing those references breaks a reference cycle\n        (``ExceptionInfo`` --> caught exception --> frame stack raising\n        the exception --> current frame stack --> local variables -->\n        ``ExceptionInfo``) which makes Python keep all objects referenced\n        from that cycle (including all local variables in the current\n        frame) alive until the next cyclic garbage collection run.

2024-04-06 13:37:06 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Analyzing the provided context from the search results, we can deduce several key points relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **`RaisesContext` Class**: The `RaisesContext` class is defined in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` and is likely the core of the `pytest.raises` context manager functionality. It has an `__init__` method that accepts `expected_exception`, `message`, and `match_expr` as parameters, and it defines `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are essential for context manager behavior. However, the provided snippet does not show how the exception is stored or handled within these methods.\n\n2. **`raises` Function**: The `raises` function is also located in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` and is documented extensively. It is designed to assert that a code block or function call raises an `expected_exception`. It can be used both as a context manager and in a legacy form where a callable is specified. When used as a context manager, it produces an `ExceptionInfo` object, which can be used to inspect the details of the captured exception. This is a crucial point because the issue mentions that to get the full error message, one must use `str(e.value)`, which suggests that the exception\'s message is stored in the `ExceptionInfo` object referenced by `e`.\n\n3. **Behavior of `pytest.raises`**: The documentation of the `raises` function explains how to use it as a context manager and mentions that the captured exception is available through an `ExceptionInfo` object. This aligns with the issue\'s description, where the user expects `str(e)` to return the full exception message but needs to use `str(e.value)` instead. The documentation does not explicitly state this behavior, which might be why it\'s considered a "gotcha."\n\n4. **Search for Usage Example**: The search for a code snippet using `pytest.raises(LookupError) as e` did not return any results. This means we don\'t have direct examples from the pytest codebase showing how this specific pattern is used or tested, which could have provided additional insights into the expected behavior or common practices.\n\nGiven this context, the core of the issue seems to be a discrepancy in expectations regarding how the `pytest.raises` context manager\'s variable (`e` in the provided example) should behave when converted to a string. In typical Python exception handling (`try-except` blocks), `str(e)` would return the exception\'s message. However, with `pytest.raises`, `e` is an `ExceptionInfo` object, and its string representation does not directly return the exception message; instead, `e.value` holds the actual exception, and `str(e.value)` is needed to get its message.\n\nTo address this issue, a patch could involve either updating the documentation to make this behavior clearer or modifying the `ExceptionInfo` object\'s `__str__` method (if appropriate and feasible) to return the contained exception\'s message directly, aligning it more closely with standard Python exception handling behavior. However, any change in behavior would need to be carefully considered for backward compatibility and consistency with other parts of pytest.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

 {'role': 'assistant',
  'content': 'Analyzing the provided context from the search results, we can deduce several key points relevant to the issue at hand:\n'
             '\n'
             '1. **`RaisesContext` Class**: The `RaisesContext` class is defined in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` and is likely the core of the `pytest.raises` '
             'context manager functionality. It has an `__init__` method that accepts `expected_exception`, `message`, and `match_expr` as parameters, and it '
             'defines `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are essential for context manager behavior. However, the provided snippet does not show how '
             'the exception is stored or handled within these methods.\n'
             '\n'
             '2. **`raises` Function**: The `raises` function is also located in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` and is documented extensively. It is designed to '
             'assert that a code block or function call raises an `expected_exception`. It can be used both as a context manager and in a legacy form where a '
             'callable is specified. When used as a context manager, it produces an `ExceptionInfo` object, which can be used to inspect the details of the '
             'captured exception. This is a crucial point because the issue mentions that to get the full error message, one must use `str(e.value)`, which '
             "suggests that the exception's message is stored in the `ExceptionInfo` object referenced by `e`.\n"
             '\n'
             '3. **Behavior of `pytest.raises`**: The documentation of the `raises` function explains how to use it as a context manager and mentions that the '
             "captured exception is available through an `ExceptionInfo` object. This aligns with the issue's description, where the user expects `str(e)` to "
             'return the full exception message but needs to use `str(e.value)` instead. The documentation does not explicitly state this behavior, which '
             'might be why it\'s considered a "gotcha."\n'
             '\n'
             '4. **Search for Usage Example**: The search for a code snippet using `pytest.raises(LookupError) as e` did not return any results. This means we '
             "don't have direct examples from the pytest codebase showing how this specific pattern is used or tested, which could have provided additional "
             'insights into the expected behavior or common practices.\n'
             '\n'
             "Given this context, the core of the issue seems to be a discrepancy in expectations regarding how the `pytest.raises` context manager's variable "
             '(`e` in the provided example) should behave when converted to a string. In typical Python exception handling (`try-except` blocks), `str(e)` '
             "would return the exception's message. However, with `pytest.raises`, `e` is an `ExceptionInfo` object, and its string representation does not "
             'directly return the exception message; instead, `e.value` holds the actual exception, and `str(e.value)` is needed to get its message.\n'
             '\n'
             'To address this issue, a patch could involve either updating the documentation to make this behavior clearer or modifying the `ExceptionInfo` '
             "object's `__str__` method (if appropriate and feasible) to return the contained exception's message directly, aligning it more closely with "
             'standard Python exception handling behavior. However, any change in behavior would need to be carefully considered for backward compatibility '
             'and consistency with other parts of pytest.'},
