Specifically, we need to investigate the handling of string arguments in `MatrixSymbol` and how `MatAdd` processes its arguments, especially in relation to the error mentioned. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `MatAdd` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that might be involved in the issue.\n2. Search for the `sympify` function to understand how it's implemented and why it might fail to parse certain expressions.\n3. Search for the `_print_MatAdd` method within the `pretty.py` file, as this seems to be directly involved in the error.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"MatAdd\")\nsearch_method(\"sympify\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_print_MatAdd\", \"./sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")\n```"
