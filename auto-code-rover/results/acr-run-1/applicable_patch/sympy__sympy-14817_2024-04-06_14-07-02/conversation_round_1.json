In the following,\n    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n    interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises\n    an error when used improperly:\n\n    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    bitcount(42)\n    >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\n    O(x)\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    TypeError: unbound method...\n\n    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\n    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_\n    >>> ns = {}\n    >>> exec_('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)\n    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n    6\n\n    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\n    >>> exec_('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2\n    (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter\n    names that are defined in abc).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> _clash1\n    {'C': C, 'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'Q': Q, 'S': S}\n    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted.

You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    \"\"\"\n    if evaluate is None:\n        if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n            evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n        else:\n            evaluate = True\n    try:\n        if a in sympy_classes:\n            return a\n    except TypeError: # Type of a is unhashable\n        pass\n    try:\n        cls = a.__class__\n    except AttributeError:  # a is probably an old-style class object\n        cls = type(a)\n    if cls in sympy_classes:\n        return a\n    if cls is type(None):\n        if strict:\n            raise SympifyError(a)\n        else:\n            return a\n\n    # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n    # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n    if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n        import numpy as np\n        if np.isscalar(a):\n            return _convert_numpy_types(a)\n\n    try:\n        return converter[cls](a)\n    except KeyError:\n        for superclass in getmro(cls):\n            try:\n                return converter[superclass](a)\n            except KeyError:\n                continue\n\n    if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    try:\n        return a._sympy_()\n    except AttributeError:\n        pass\n\n    if not strict:\n        # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n        # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n        try:\n            from ..tensor.array import Array\n            return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n\n    if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n        for coerce in (float, int):\n            try:\n                return sympify(coerce(a))\n            except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, SympifyError):\n                continue\n\n    if strict:\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    if iterable(a):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n    if isinstance(a, dict):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n\n    # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n    # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n    # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n    # anything to SymPy expression).\n    #\n    # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n    # and try to parse it.

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, let's analyze the context around the issue reported:\n\n1. **`MatAdd` Class**: This class is found in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py` and is a part of the matrix expressions module in SymPy. It inherits from `MatrixExpr` and `AssocOp`, indicating that it represents an associative operation (like addition) on matrix expressions. The class contains methods for various operations, including transposition, adjoint, trace, and expansion (`doit`). However, the search results do not directly reveal how it handles its arguments in terms of string representation or pretty printing.\n\n2. **`sympify` Function**: Located in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, this function is crucial for converting various types of inputs (including strings, numbers, and lists) into SymPy's internal representation. It supports a wide range of inputs and has mechanisms for extending this support to custom objects. The function uses `eval` for parsing strings, which is mentioned as a potential security concern for unsanitized input. Importantly, the function tries to handle unhashable types, numpy arrays, and iterables, attempting to convert them into a form that SymPy can work with. If it encounters an object it cannot convert, and if not in strict mode, it attempts to parse the object's string representation.\n\n3. **`_print_MatAdd` Method**: Unfortunately, the search for `_print_MatAdd` in `./sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` did not yield any results, indicating either an issue with the search or that the file path might have been incorrect or changed. This method is likely responsible for handling the pretty printing of `MatAdd` objects, which is where the issue seems to arise.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how `MatAdd` objects are converted to strings for pretty printing, particularly when dealing with matrix symbols that include special characters (like 'y*') in their names. The error traceback suggests that during pretty printing, the code attempts to sympify part of a matrix symbol's name ('y*'), leading to a syntax error due to the unexpected end of the file (EOF).\n\nThe error with `sympify` trying to parse 'y*' and failing suggests that there might be an incorrect assumption or handling in the pretty printing logic for matrix expressions, particularly when dealing with negative arguments or special characters in symbol names.\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to:\n- Review how `MatAdd` and its superclass `AssocOp` handle their arguments, especially in terms of string representation and pretty printing.\n- Investigate the pretty printing logic for matrix expressions to understand why it might attempt to sympify parts of an expression inappropriately.\n- Ensure that matrix symbols and their operations are correctly converted to strings without unnecessary or incorrect calls to `sympify`.\n\nSince we couldn't directly access the `_print_MatAdd` method, the next steps would involve manually reviewing the relevant code in the pretty printing module (`pretty.py`) and possibly adjusting how matrix expressions are converted to strings for printing, ensuring that special characters in symbol names are handled correctly and that sympify is not misused in this context."
