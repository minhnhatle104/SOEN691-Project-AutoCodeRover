            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how the `If-Modified-Since` header is handled in the codebase. Given the description of the issue, it seems like the handling of this header has changed recently, leading to an exception when an empty string is passed. To start, we should look for the code that parses or checks the `If-Modified-Since` header. Here are the API calls that could help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_code(\"If-Modified-Since\")`: This will help us find all occurrences of the `If-Modified-Since` header being referenced in the codebase. It's a broad search that can give us an overview of where this header is being handled.\n\n2. `search_code(\"d6aff369ad3\")`: Since the issue mentions a specific commit `d6aff369ad3` where the behavior changed, searching for this commit ID might help us find the exact changes made in that commit, assuming the commit ID is referenced in comments or documentation within the codebase. This is a bit of a long shot, as commit IDs are not always mentioned in code comments, but it's worth a try.\n\nThese searches should provide us with a starting point to understand how the `If-Modified-Since` header is processed and where the recent changes might have introduced the issue with empty strings."
