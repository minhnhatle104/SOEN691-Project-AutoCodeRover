Specifically, we should look into the `BlockMatrix` class, the `_blockmul` method within it, and how `ZeroMatrix` and `Zero` objects are handled during block multiplication. The error messages point to an issue with handling `Zero` objects that lack a 'cols' attribute, which should be present in matrix-like objects.\n\nLet's start by investigating the following:\n\n1. The `BlockMatrix` class to understand its structure and how it handles blocks, especially `ZeroMatrix` blocks.\n2. The `_blockmul` method within the `BlockMatrix` class to see how block multiplication is implemented and how it might lead to the conversion of `ZeroMatrix` to `Zero`.\n3. The `ZeroMatrix` class to understand its properties, especially how it differs from the `Zero` class in terms of attributes like 'cols'.\n4. The `Zero` class to see why it lacks the 'cols' attribute and how it's being mistakenly used in place of `ZeroMatrix`.\n\nBased on these points, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"BlockMatrix\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_blockmul\", \"BlockMatrix\")`\n- `search_class(\"ZeroMatrix\")`\n- `search_class(\"Zero\")`"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insight into the issue described in the bug report. Here's a summary of the relevant findings from each part:\n\n### BlockMatrix Class\n- Located in `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`.\n- Contains methods relevant to block matrix operations, including `_blockmul` for block multiplication.\n- The `_blockmul` method checks if the other object is a `BlockMatrix` and if the column block sizes of the first matrix match the row block sizes of the second. If these conditions are met, it performs block multiplication by multiplying the blocks directly; otherwise, it falls back to regular multiplication.\n\n### _blockmul Method\n- Specifically designed to handle multiplication between `BlockMatrix` instances.\n- The simplified logic checks for compatibility in terms of block sizes and then attempts to multiply the blocks directly.\n- This method seems to be a critical point where the issue might arise, especially in how it handles or fails to handle `ZeroMatrix` blocks correctly.\n\n### ZeroMatrix Class\n- Located in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`.\n- Represents a matrix of zeros with specified dimensions.\n- Inherits from `MatrixExpr`, indicating it should have matrix-like properties and methods, such as `shape`.\n\n### Zero Class\n- Located in `sympy/core/numbers.py`.\n- Represents the scalar zero.\n- Lacks matrix-specific attributes and methods, such as `cols`, which is expected for matrix-like objects.\n\n### Analysis of the Issue\nThe error occurs during the triple block multiplication (`b * b * b`) when a `ZeroMatrix` block is somehow being treated as or replaced with a `Zero` scalar object, which lacks the `cols` attribute necessary for matrix operations. The `_blockmul` method's handling of multiplication, especially when encountering zero blocks, seems to be at the heart of the issue. It's likely that during the multiplication process, the `ZeroMatrix` is not preserved as such, leading to an incorrect type conversion or replacement with a `Zero` object.\n\nGiven this context, the solution should ensure that `ZeroMatrix` blocks remain as `ZeroMatrix` instances throughout the multiplication process, preserving their matrix-like properties and preventing the type mismatch that leads to the `AttributeError`.\n\nA patch would likely involve modifying the `_blockmul` method to correctly handle `ZeroMatrix` blocks, ensuring they are not inadvertently converted to `Zero` scalar objects during block multiplication operations."
