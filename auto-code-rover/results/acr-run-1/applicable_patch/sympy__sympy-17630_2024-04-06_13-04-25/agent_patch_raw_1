This patch modifies the `_blockmul` method in the `BlockMatrix` class to explicitly handle the multiplication of blocks, ensuring that `ZeroMatrix` blocks are correctly maintained during the process. It introduces a loop to iterate over the blocks, performing the multiplication block by block and initializing the result blocks as `ZeroMatrix` instances with appropriate dimensions. This approach prevents the inadvertent conversion of `ZeroMatrix` blocks into `Zero` scalar objects, thus preserving the matrix-like properties required for subsequent operations.
