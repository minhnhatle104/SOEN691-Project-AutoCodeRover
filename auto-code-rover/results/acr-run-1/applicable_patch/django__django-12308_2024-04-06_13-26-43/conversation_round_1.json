        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation of `display_for_field` in the Django admin and how `JSONField` is handled. Specifically, we're looking to understand how `JSONField` values are prepared for display in readonly fields within the Django admin interface. The suggestion in the issue is to modify the handling of `JSONField` in `django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field` to ensure JSON values are displayed correctly. Let's proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `display_for_field` method in the `django.contrib.admin.utils` module to understand its current implementation and how it handles different field types, including `JSONField`.\n   \n2. Search for the `JSONField` class to understand its methods, particularly looking for a `prepare_value` method or similar that could be relevant for formatting the JSON data correctly.\n\n3. Since the issue suggests modifying how `JSONField` is handled in `display_for_field`, it might also be useful to search for any existing calls to `json.dumps` within `display_for_field` to see how JSON data is currently being formatted.\n\nHence, the API calls would be:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"display_for_field\", \"django/contrib/admin/utils.py\")`\n- `search_class(\"JSONField\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"json.dumps\", \"django/contrib/admin/utils.py\")`"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, we can make the following observations and plan our approach to address the issue:\n\n1. **`display_for_field` method in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`:**\n   - The method handles the display of various field types in the Django admin. However, from the provided code snippet, there's no explicit handling for `JSONField`. This absence likely leads to the default behavior, which might not properly format `JSONField` values for display, especially when they are marked as readonly.\n   - Notably, there's no use of `json.dumps` within this method, which aligns with the issue description suggesting that `json.dumps` or a similar mechanism (like calling `prepare_value` on the `JSONField`) should be introduced to handle `JSONField` values correctly.\n\n2. **`JSONField` classes in the codebase:**\n   - `JSONField` is present in multiple locations within the Django codebase, including both model fields (`django/db/models/fields/json.py`) and form fields (`django/forms/fields.py`, `django/contrib/postgres/forms/jsonb.py`). The most relevant for this issue is likely the model field version at `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, as the issue pertains to how `JSONField` data is displayed in the admin, which typically involves model fields.\n   - The presence of `JSONField` in different parts of the codebase suggests that any solution should be careful to handle or consider both model and form field scenarios, even though the primary concern here is with model fields in the admin interface.\n\n3. **Absence of `json.dumps` in `display_for_field`:**\n   - This confirms that the current implementation does not specifically format JSON data for display, which might result in the observed issue where JSON values are shown as Python dictionaries (`{'foo': 'bar'}`) rather than in proper JSON format (`{\"foo\": \"bar\"}`).\n\n**Approach:**\nGiven these observations, the solution should involve modifying the `display_for_field` method to add a special case for `JSONField` that correctly formats its data for display. This could involve checking if the field is an instance of `JSONField` and then using `json.dumps` to format the value, or calling a method like `prepare_value` if it exists and is appropriate for this use case. Additionally, we should ensure that any changes do not negatively impact the handling of `JSONField` in forms or other contexts outside of the admin display.\n\nNext steps would involve examining the `JSONField` implementation in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` to understand how it prepares values for serialization and whether it provides a method like `prepare_value` that could be leveraged in `display_for_field`."
