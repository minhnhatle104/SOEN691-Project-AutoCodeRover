Specifically, we\'re looking to understand how `JSONField` values are prepared for display in readonly fields within the Django admin interface. The suggestion in the issue is to modify the handling of `JSONField` in `django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field` to ensure JSON values are displayed correctly. Let\'s proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `display_for_field` method in the `django.contrib.admin.utils` module to understand its current implementation and how it handles different field types, including `JSONField`.\n   \n2. Search for the `JSONField` class to understand its methods, particularly looking for a `prepare_value` method or similar that could be relevant for formatting the JSON data correctly.\n\n3. Since the issue suggests modifying how `JSONField` is handled in `display_for_field`, it might also be useful to search for any existing calls to `json.dumps` within `display_for_field` to see how JSON data is currently being formatted.\n\nHence, the API calls would be:\n\n- `search_method_in_file("display_for_field", "django/contrib/admin/utils.py")`\n- `search_class("JSONField")`\n- `search_code_in_file("json.dumps", "django/contrib/admin/utils.py")`', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

2024-04-06 13:29:12 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="The additional context gathered provides crucial insights into how `JSONField` is implemented and how it handles the preparation of values, particularly in relation to the issue at hand. Here's an analysis based on the new information:\n\n1. **`prepare_value` in `JSONField` (from `django/forms/fields.py`):**\n   - The `prepare_value` method in the form field version of `JSONField` checks if the value is an instance of `InvalidJSONInput` and returns it directly if so. Otherwise, it uses `json.dumps` to serialize the value, using a potentially custom encoder specified by the `self.encoder` attribute.\n   - This method is specifically designed to prepare JSON data for serialization, which is exactly what we need for properly displaying `JSONField` values in the Django admin as valid JSON strings.\n\n2. **`JSONField` in `django/db/models/fields/json.py`:**\n   - The snippet from `django/db/models/fields/json.py` does not provide detailed information about methods within the `JSONField` model field class, such as a `prepare_value` method or similar. However, it confirms the existence and basic structure of the `JSONField` model field.\n   - Given that the `prepare_value` method was found in the form field version of `JSONField` but not explicitly mentioned in the model field version, we might infer that the model field version does not have a `prepare_value` method tailored for admin display purposes. This gap is likely where the issue stems from, as the admin interface would benefit from a similar preparation of JSON data for display.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe issue lies in the absence of appropriate handling for `JSONField` values in the `display_for_field` method within `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`. The method does not currently account for the special needs of displaying JSON data as valid JSON strings, especially when those fields are marked as readonly in the admin.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we should enhance the `display_for_field` method to include a special case for `JSONField`. This enhancement would involve checking if the field is an instance of `JSONField` and then appropriately formatting the value for display, likely using `json.dumps` or a similar mechanism.

             '\n'
             '1. **`display_for_field` method in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`:**\n'
             "   - The method handles the display of various field types in the Django admin. However, from the provided code snippet, there's no explicit "
             'handling for `JSONField`. This absence likely leads to the default behavior, which might not properly format `JSONField` values for display, '
             'especially when they are marked as readonly.\n'
             "   - Notably, there's no use of `json.dumps` within this method, which aligns with the issue description suggesting that `json.dumps` or a "
             'similar mechanism (like calling `prepare_value` on the `JSONField`) should be introduced to handle `JSONField` values correctly.\n'
             '\n'
             '2. **`JSONField` classes in the codebase:**\n'
             '   - `JSONField` is present in multiple locations within the Django codebase, including both model fields (`django/db/models/fields/json.py`) '
             'and form fields (`django/forms/fields.py`, `django/contrib/postgres/forms/jsonb.py`). The most relevant for this issue is likely the model field '
             'version at `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, as the issue pertains to how `JSONField` data is displayed in the admin, which typically involves '
             'model fields.\n'
             '   - The presence of `JSONField` in different parts of the codebase suggests that any solution should be careful to handle or consider both '
             'model and form field scenarios, even though the primary concern here is with model fields in the admin interface.\n'
             '\n'
             '3. **Absence of `json.dumps` in `display_for_field`:**\n'
             '   - This confirms that the current implementation does not specifically format JSON data for display, which might result in the observed issue '
             'where JSON values are shown as Python dictionaries (`{\'foo\': \'bar\'}`) rather than in proper JSON format (`{"foo": "bar"}`).\n'

             'Given these observations, the solution should involve modifying the `display_for_field` method to add a special case for `JSONField` that '

It uses Django's `DjangoJSONEncoder` for JSON serialization, which is more suited for handling model instances and other complex data types that might be stored in a `JSONField`. This approach ensures that `JSONField` values are displayed as valid JSON strings in the admin interface when marked as readonly, addressing the issue described.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
