Since the initial search for `format_cursor_data` in the specified file path did not yield results, and considering the importance of this method in the issue, we should attempt to locate this method in the codebase without relying on the specific file path provided. This approach will help us understand how `format_cursor_data` interacts with `BoundaryNorm` and leads to the crash. Therefore, the following search API call is necessary:\n\n- **Search for the `format_cursor_data` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us locate the method and understand its implementation, which is crucial for addressing the issue.\n  - `search_method(\"format_cursor_data\")`\n\nThis search is aimed at getting a clearer picture of where the bug occurs and how the `format_cursor_data` method is implemented, which is essential for devising an appropriate fix."
