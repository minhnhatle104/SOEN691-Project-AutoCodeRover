Given the information in the issue, here are the API calls that would be most useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `BoundaryNorm` class**: This will help us understand the implementation details of `BoundaryNorm`, especially why it's not invertible as mentioned in the error.\n   - `search_class(\"BoundaryNorm\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `format_cursor_data` method within the `artist.py` file**: Since the traceback points to this method as the source of the crash, understanding its implementation will be crucial for devising a fix.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"format_cursor_data\", \"/Users/jklymak/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/artist.py\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `inverse` method within the `BoundaryNorm` class**: The error specifically mentions that the `inverse` method of `BoundaryNorm` raises a `ValueError`. Understanding how this method is implemented will be key to addressing the issue.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"inverse\", \"BoundaryNorm\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem at hand, allowing us to explore potential solutions, such as making `BoundaryNorm` approximately invertible or handling the exception gracefully."
