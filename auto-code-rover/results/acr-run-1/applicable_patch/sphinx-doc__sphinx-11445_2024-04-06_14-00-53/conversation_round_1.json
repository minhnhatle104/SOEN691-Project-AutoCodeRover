Given the nature of the issue, it seems pertinent to explore how Sphinx handles the `rst_prolog` configuration, the parsing of RST documents, and the rendering of headings that contain domain directives. \n\nBased on the information provided in the issue, we should look into the following areas of the Sphinx codebase:\n\n1. How the `rst_prolog` setting is applied to documents.\n2. The parsing process of RST documents, especially how headings are parsed and rendered.\n3. The handling of domain directives in headings and their inclusion in the toctree.\n\nGiven these areas, the following API calls seem relevant to gather more context:\n\n- `search_code(\"rst_prolog\")`: This will help us understand how the `rst_prolog` setting is processed and applied to documents.\n- `search_method(\"parse_document\")`: Assuming there's a method responsible for parsing RST documents, this search could help us find it and understand how headings are handled.\n- `search_code(\"toctree\")`: Since the issue mentions that headings with domain directives are not included in the toctree, searching for references to `toctree` might provide insights into how these are processed.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls:\n\n1. `search_code(\"rst_prolog\")`\n2. `search_method(\"parse_document\")`\n3. `search_code(\"toctree\")`"

        "content": "Based on the results from the search queries, we have gathered significant information that could help us understand the issue better and potentially lead us to a solution. Here's an analysis of the collected context:\n\n1. **`rst_prolog` Usage in the Codebase:**\n   - The `rst_prolog` setting is referenced in several files, with `sphinx/config.py`, `sphinx/parsers.py`, `sphinx/util/rst.py`, and `sphinx/transforms/i18n.py` being the most relevant ones outside of test files. This suggests that the handling of `rst_prolog` is spread across configuration loading (`config.py`), parsing (`parsers.py`), utility functions (`util/rst.py`), and internationalization transformations (`transforms/i18n.py`).\n\n2. **Absence of `parse_document` Method:**\n   - The search for a method named `parse_document` yielded no results, which implies that the parsing of documents might not be encapsulated in a single method with that specific name. Document parsing in Sphinx is likely handled by a combination of methods and classes spread across different modules, particularly within the parsing and transformation stages.\n\n3. **`toctree` References in the Codebase:**\n   - The `toctree` is referenced extensively, indicating its importance in Sphinx's document structure management. Notably, `sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py` and `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py` contain a significant number of matches, suggesting these modules play a crucial role in toctree processing and collection. This could be where issues related to toctree inclusion of headings with domain directives are addressed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps to approach the issue could involve:\n\n- **Exploring `rst_prolog` Handling:** Reviewing how `rst_prolog` is processed in `sphinx/config.py`, `sphinx/parsers.py`, `sphinx/util/rst.py`, and `sphinx/transforms/i18n.py` could provide insights into how the prolog is applied to documents and how it might interfere with the rendering of headings.\n\n- **Investigating Document Parsing and Rendering:** Since there's no single `parse_document` method, it would be beneficial to look into the parsing and rendering process more broadly, focusing on how headings and domain directives are handled. This might involve reviewing the parsing process in `sphinx/parsers.py` and rendering mechanisms in files related to HTML generation, such as `sphinx/writers/html5.py`.\n\n- **Understanding `toctree` Processing:** Delving into `sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py` and `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py` could shed light on how Sphinx decides which headings to include in the toctree and how domain directives in headings might affect this process.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can further narrow down the cause of the issue and work towards developing a patch to resolve it."
