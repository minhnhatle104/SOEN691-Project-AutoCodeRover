Given the complexity of the `simplify` function and without a specific pinpointed cause for the issue from the provided context, a general approach to patching this issue would involve adding a check to ensure that the simplification process does not inadvertently change the nature of expressions involving exponentiation, especially when these expressions contain symbolic bases and exponents. This patch aims to introduce a safeguard for preserving the equivalence of expressions through the simplification process, particularly focusing on the handling of expressions similar to `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1`.

However, it's important to note that without a deeper analysis and understanding of the specific cause within the `simplify` function, this patch is more of a conceptual approach rather than a definitive fix. It's intended to illustrate how one might begin to address the issue based on the information provided.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>if expr.could_extract_minus_sign():
    n, d = fraction(expr)
    if d != 0:
        expr = signsimp(-n/(-d))</original>
<patched># Before applying signsimp, check if the operation changes the nature of exponentiation expressions
if expr.could_extract_minus_sign():
    n, d = fraction(expr)
    if d != 0:
        # Proposed check to ensure simplification does not alter equivalence
        temp_expr = signsimp(-n/(-d))
        # Verify if temp_expr simplification maintains equivalence for a sample symbolic substitution
        from sympy.abc import _clash1
        x_sample = _clash1['x']
        if simplify(expr.subs(x_sample, S(1))) == simplify(temp_expr.subs(x_sample, S(1))):
            expr = temp_expr</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):
    expr = original_expr</original>
<patched># Enhanced check to ensure that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original
# This involves a more nuanced measure that considers the nature of the expression, especially for exponentiation
if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):
    # Introduce a symbolic test to confirm equivalence of original and simplified expressions
    from sympy.abc import _clash1
    x_sample = _clash1['x']
    if not (simplify(expr - original_expr).subs(x_sample, S(1)) == 0):
        expr = original_expr</patched>
```

This approach introduces additional checks to ensure that the simplification process does not result in expressions that are not equivalent to the original, especially for cases involving exponentiation with symbolic bases and exponents. The use of symbolic substitution as a heuristic check is a simplistic way to test for equivalence, and in practice, a more robust method may be necessary to handle a wider variety of expressions and edge cases.
