Explanation:
The patch modifies the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class to use a more sophisticated dimension comparison. Instead of checking for strict equality between dimensions (`dim != addend_dim`), it uses a hypothetical method `equivalent_dims` of the `DimensionSystem` class to check if two dimensions are equivalent, even if not exactly the same. This approach allows for recognizing that dimensions like velocity and acceleration*time are equivalent for the purpose of addition.

Note: This patch assumes the existence of an `equivalent_dims` method in the `DimensionSystem` class, which should be implemented to check for dimensional equivalence. If such a method does not exist, it would need to be implemented as part of the solution.
