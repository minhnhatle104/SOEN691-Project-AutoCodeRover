            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method works and how it interacts with the dimensions and scale factors of quantities. Given the error message and the context of the issue, it's clear that the method is not correctly handling the addition of quantities with equivalent dimensions. To get more context and potentially identify the source of the bug, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(method_name: str, class_name: str)` to find the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within the `UnitSystem` class, as it's likely part of this class based on the usage context. This will help us understand how the method processes dimensions and factors.\n   \n2. `search_class(class_name: str)` to find the `Dimension` class, as understanding how dimensions are represented and compared might be crucial to solving the issue. This can give us insight into how dimensions like velocity and acceleration*time are treated within the system.\n\n3. `search_class(class_name: str)` to find the `Quantity` class, since the issue involves operations with `Quantity` objects. Understanding how quantities are defined and how their dimensions and scale factors are set could be key to identifying the bug.\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering sufficient information to understand the underlying mechanisms that could be contributing to the issue.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_collect_factor_and_dimension\", \"UnitSystem\")`\n- `search_class(\"Dimension\")`\n- `search_class(\"Quantity\")`"
