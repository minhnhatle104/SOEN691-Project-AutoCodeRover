        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we can start piecing together how the issue might be arising and consider potential solutions.\n\n### `_collect_factor_and_dimension` Method Analysis\nThe `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class is designed to return a tuple with a scale factor expression and a dimension expression for a given expression. The method handles different types of expressions, including `Quantity`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, `Function`, and `Dimension`. The issue arises in the `Add` branch of the method, where it checks if the dimensions of all addends are the same. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. This is a simplistic approach that does not account for equivalent dimensions that are not exactly the same but are compatible (e.g., velocity and acceleration*time).\n\n### `Dimension` Class Analysis\nThe `Dimension` class represents dimensions and supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power. It has properties and methods that might be used to compare dimensions more effectively than a simple equality check. The class's methods suggest that dimensions are treated as mathematical expressions, which could be leveraged to check for equivalent dimensions.\n\n### `Quantity` Class Analysis\nThe `Quantity` class represents physical quantities with a dimension and a scale factor. It includes methods for setting dimensions and scale factors, converting between quantities, and other utility functions. The class interacts closely with the `Dimension` class, as each quantity has an associated dimension.\n\n### Potential Solution Direction\nGiven the issue's description and the context provided by the search results, the problem seems to stem from the handling of addition in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. Specifically, the method fails to recognize that dimensions like velocity and acceleration*time can be equivalent. A potential solution could involve enhancing the dimension comparison logic in the `Add` branch of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. This could be achieved by utilizing the capabilities of the `Dimension` class to check for dimensional equivalence rather than strict equality.\n\nA more sophisticated comparison might involve checking if the dimensional expressions of the addends can be simplified to a common form or if there's a way to determine that they represent the same physical dimension despite being expressed differently.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo proceed with a patch, we would need to:\n1. Explore the `Dimension` class methods to find a suitable way to compare dimensions for equivalence rather than strict equality.\n2. Modify the `Add` branch of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class to use this more sophisticated dimension comparison approach.\n3. Ensure that the solution does not negatively impact the handling of other expression types in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for developing a patch to address the issue."
