        "content": "The issue reported is related to the `parse_http_date` function within `django/utils/http.py`. This function is designed to parse dates formatted according to HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1, which allows three different date formats. However, the primary concern raised in the issue is the handling of two-digit years in the RFC850 date format.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet, the current logic for handling two-digit years is as follows:\n- If the year is less than 70, it is considered to be in the 2000s (e.g., 69 is interpreted as 2069).\n- If the year is between 70 and 99, it is considered to be in the 1900s (e.g., 71 is interpreted as 1971).\n\nThis approach is hardcoded and does not comply with the guidance provided in RFC 7231 (and similarly in RFC 2822), which states that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\n\nTo address this issue, the logic for interpreting two-digit years needs to be updated to dynamically compare the two-digit year against the current year, rather than relying on a hardcoded range. This will ensure that the interpretation of two-digit years aligns with the specifications outlined in RFC 7231, thereby improving the accuracy of the `parse_http_date` function's date parsing capabilities."
