            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about how the project handles template tags, especially in relation to the `TEMPLATES` configuration and the mechanism for checking duplicate template tag names. Given the information provided in the issue, the following API calls would be beneficial to understand the underlying code structure and logic:\n\n1. Search for the method or function that is likely responsible for the error mentioned in the issue. Since the error message includes `(templates.E003)`, it suggests there might be a specific check or validation method that throws this error. Therefore, searching for a method that includes \"check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name\" or similar logic would be a good start.\n2. Investigate how the project configures its templates, specifically how it handles the `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']` configuration. This requires looking into the code that parses or utilizes this part of the configuration.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following search API calls are proposed:\n\n- `search_method(\"check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name\")`: This will help us find the method responsible for checking duplicate template tag names, which is directly related to the issue.\n- `search_code(\"TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']\")`: This will help us understand how the project handles the template libraries configuration, which seems to be related to the issue based on the description.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue and formulating a patch."
