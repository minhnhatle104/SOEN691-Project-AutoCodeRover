Enhancements here could explicitly catch `Http404` exceptions to either continue the resolution process with other patterns or improve the debug response.\n   - **File**: `django/urls/converters.py`\n     - **Method**: Potentially within the implementation of specific converters that utilize the `to_python` method. While the exact method wasn't pinpointed through the searches, this file is relevant due to its role in defining how path parameters are converted and could be a place to handle `Http404` exceptions raised during conversion."
