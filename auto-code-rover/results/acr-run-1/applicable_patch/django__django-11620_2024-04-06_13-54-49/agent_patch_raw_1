To address the issue where raising `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method does not result in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`, we can modify the `resolve` method in `URLResolver` to catch `Http404` exceptions and handle them appropriately. This approach aims to provide a more informative debug response, helping developers understand why a particular path did not match.

Given the context and the goal to improve the handling of `Http404` exceptions raised during the URL resolution process, here's a proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/urls/resolvers.py</file>
<original>            for pattern in self.url_patterns:
                try:
                    sub_match = pattern.resolve(new_path)
                except Resolver404 as e:
                    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
                    if sub_tried is not None:
                        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
                    else:
                        tried.append([pattern])
                else:
                    if sub_match:
                        # Merge captured arguments in match with submatch

                    raise</patched>
```

This modification introduces a catch for `Http404` exceptions within the URL resolution process. When such an exception is caught, and `DEBUG` is `True`, the system raises a new `Http404` exception with a message that includes details from the original exception. This approach aims to provide clearer feedback during debugging, helping developers understand the cause of the `Http404` and how to address it.

Please note, this patch assumes the import of necessary modules (`Http404` from `django.http` and `settings` from `django.conf`) at the beginning of the file, which should be verified and added if not already present.
