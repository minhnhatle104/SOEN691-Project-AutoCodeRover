Given the constraints and the need for a precise match with the original program for the patch to apply correctly, let's adjust the proposed modification to align exactly with the provided code snippet, ensuring it integrates seamlessly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/urls/resolvers.py</file>
<original>                except Resolver404 as e:
                    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
                    if sub_tried is not None:
                        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
                    else:
                        tried.append([pattern])</original>
<patched>                except Resolver404 as e:
                    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
                    if sub_tried is not None:
                        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
                    else:
                        tried.append([pattern])
                except Http404 as http404_exc:
                    # If DEBUG is True, enhance the debug response with Http404 exception details
                    if settings.DEBUG:
                        raise Http404(f"Http404 raised while resolving URL: {http404_exc}")</patched>
```

This modification introduces a specific catch block for `Http404` exceptions within the `resolve` method of the `URLResolver` class. When such an exception is caught, and `DEBUG` is `True`, the system raises a new `Http404` exception with a message that includes details from the original exception. This aims to provide clearer feedback during debugging, helping developers understand the cause of the `Http404` and how to address it.

Please ensure that the necessary imports (`Http404` from `django.http` and `settings` from `django.conf`) are present at the beginning of the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file for this patch to work correctly.
