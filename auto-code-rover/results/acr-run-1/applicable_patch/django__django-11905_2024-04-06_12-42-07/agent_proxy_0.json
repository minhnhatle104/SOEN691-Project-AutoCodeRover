            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how `__isnull` is implemented and used in the project. Based on the description, `__isnull` seems to be a lookup mechanism, possibly related to database query operations. It's likely part of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or a database access layer. Given this, we should first identify the class or module where `__isnull` is defined or primarily used. Then, we can look into how it's validated or processed.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method(\"__isnull\")`: This will help us find where the `__isnull` method is defined or used across the project. It's a starting point to understand its implementation and usage context.\n\n2. `search_code(\"__isnull\")`: By searching for the code snippet `__isnull`, we aim to find instances where `__isnull` is used in the codebase. This can provide insights into its application and potentially lead us to the validation logic that needs to be updated.\n\nThese searches will help us pinpoint the locations in the codebase that are relevant to the issue, allowing us to further analyze and devise a suitable patch."
