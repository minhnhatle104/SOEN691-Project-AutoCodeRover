            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation details of the Django migration system, specifically focusing on how indexes and constraints are handled during migrations. The error occurs in the `_delete_composed_index` method, which is part of the schema handling in Django's database backend. Given this information, the following API calls would be relevant to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the class where the `_delete_composed_index` method is defined to understand its role and implementation:\n   - `search_method(\"delete_composed_index\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific file path (`django/db/backends/base/schema.py`), it would be useful to search for the method within this file to get the exact implementation details:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"_delete_composed_index\", \"django/db/backends/base/schema.py\")`\n\n3. The issue description also hints at a broader context involving the handling of `unique_together` and `index_together` attributes in model migrations. To get a better understanding of how these attributes are processed during migrations, it would be beneficial to search for their usage in the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"unique_together\")`\n   - `search_code(\"index_together\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how Django handles index and constraint deletions during migrations, the specific implementation of the `_delete_composed_index` method, and how `unique_together` and `index_together` attributes are processed, which are all relevant to addressing the issue at hand."
