Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **Search for the method handling the `--fixtures` option**: This will likely be part of the command-line parsing or a specific method that handles displaying fixtures. I'll start by searching for a method that might be responsible for processing the `--fixtures` argument.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"--fixtures\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for the fixture registration or handling mechanism**: Since we want to display the scope of fixtures, understanding how fixtures are registered and their scope determined is crucial. This involves looking into the class or method that handles fixture registration.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"register_fixture\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for the method that displays fixtures**: There should be a method responsible for the actual display of fixtures when `--fixtures` is used. This method might need to be modified or extended to include fixture scopes.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"display_fixtures\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding how pytest currently handles fixtures and the `--fixtures` option, and where modifications might be needed to include fixture scopes in the output."

This indicates a need to adjust our search strategy to better align with how pytest's codebase is structured and how it handles fixtures and command-line arguments.\n\n### Adjusted Analysis Strategy\n\n1. **Understanding pytest's Fixture Mechanism**: Since the direct search for fixture registration and display methods did not yield results, it's possible that fixtures are handled through a more integrated system within pytest. Fixtures in pytest are a core feature, so their management might be spread across several modules or classes.\n\n2. **Command-Line Argument Handling**: The absence of a direct method for `--fixtures` suggests that pytest uses a more generic system for parsing and handling command-line arguments. It's common for applications to have a centralized command-line parsing mechanism that delegates actions based on the arguments received.\n\n3. **Fixture Scope Representation**: To display fixture scopes, we need to understand how scopes are represented internally within pytest. This information is likely associated with the fixture definition, either as a parameter or attribute.\n\n### Revised Search Strategy\n\nGiven these considerations, here are some revised search queries to help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for Fixture Definition or Management**: Instead of looking for a method to register fixtures, let's search for where fixtures might be defined or managed in the codebase.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"FixtureDef\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for Command-Line Argument Parsing**: Since the direct search for `--fixtures` didn't yield results, let's look for how pytest parses command-line arguments in general.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"parse_args\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for Fixture Scope Representation**: To understand how fixture scopes are represented, we should look for any code or class that might deal with this aspect.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"fixture scope\")\n    ```\n\nThese adjusted searches should help us better understand the underlying mechanisms in pytest related to fixtures and command-line argument handling, which are crucial for addressing the issue at hand."
