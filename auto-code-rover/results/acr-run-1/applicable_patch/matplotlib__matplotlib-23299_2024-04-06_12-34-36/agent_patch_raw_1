Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem arises due to the interaction between `rc_context` and the figure management within `Gcf`. The issue description and the provided code snippets do not directly point to a specific line or method that causes figures to disappear from `Gcf.figs` when `get_backend()` is called. However, based on the analysis, a potential solution could involve ensuring that figure references within `Gcf` are preserved or properly managed when `rcParams` are temporarily changed by `rc_context`.

Since the direct cause of the issue is not explicitly identified in the provided code snippets, the following patch is speculative and aims to address the potential interaction problem between `rc_context` usage and figure management. This patch assumes that the issue might be related to how `rcParams` changes are handled and proposes to add a safeguard to preserve `Gcf.figs` across `rc_context` blocks.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>def rc_context(rc=None, fname=None):
    """
    Return a context manager for temporarily changing rcParams.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rc : dict
        The rcParams to temporarily set.
    fname : str or path-like
        A file with Matplotlib rc settings. If both *fname* and *rc* are given,
        settings from *rc* take precedence.

    Examples
    --------
    Passing explicit values via a dict::

        with mpl.rc_context({'interactive': False}):
            fig, ax = plt.subplots()
            ax.plot(range(3), range(3))
            fig.savefig('example.png')
            plt.close(fig)

    Loading settings from a file::

         with mpl.rc_context(fname='print.rc'):
             plt.plot(x, y)  # uses 'print.rc'

This patch attempts to preserve the state of `Gcf.figs` across the execution of `rc_context` by copying the current state before any changes are made and restoring it afterward. This approach is speculative and aims to address the symptom of the issue as described. However, it's important to note that further investigation and testing would be necessary to ensure that this patch does not introduce other side effects or fail to address the root cause of the problem if it lies elsewhere in the interaction between `rc_context`, `rcParams`, and figure management.
