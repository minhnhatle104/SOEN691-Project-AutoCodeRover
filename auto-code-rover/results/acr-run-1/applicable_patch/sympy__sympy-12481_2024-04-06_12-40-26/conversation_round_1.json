        "content": "Based on the information from the `Permutation` class found in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, we can see that the class is quite comprehensive, with methods for creating permutations, manipulating them, and querying their properties. The issue mentions a problem with the constructor when non-disjoint cycles are passed to it, which suggests that we should look into how the constructor (`__new__` method) handles its arguments, particularly how it deals with cycles.\n\nThe `Permutation` class does not explicitly show a constructor that takes cycles as input in the provided information. However, it's common for such functionality to be implemented in either the `__new__` method or through class methods that serve as alternative constructors. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that the handling of cycles (especially non-disjoint ones) is not properly implemented or is missing.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to understand how cycles are supposed to be converted into the permutation they represent and ensure that non-disjoint cycles are handled correctly by applying them in left-to-right order as specified in the issue description. This might involve modifying the `__new__` method or adding/improving a class method that deals with cycle input.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve:\n1. Examining the `__new__` method to understand how it currently processes its arguments.\n2. Looking for any class methods that might be responsible for handling cycle input, such as a method that converts cycles to the permutation's internal representation (array form or cyclic form).\n\nThis analysis will help us identify where the bug is and how to approach fixing it."
