            aform = list(range(max(flatten(args)) + 1))  # Initialize with the identity permutation up to the max element in cycles
            for cycle in args:
                for i in range(len(cycle) - 1, 0, -1):

```

This patch addresses the issue by first removing the check that raises an error for duplicate elements when cycles are provided as input. This allows non-disjoint cycles to be passed to the constructor. The second modification changes how cycles are processed. Instead of using the `Cycle` class, which does not support non-disjoint cycles, it manually applies the cycles in left-to-right order. This is done by initializing an identity permutation array and then applying each cycle through element swapping, which effectively applies the cycles as required.
