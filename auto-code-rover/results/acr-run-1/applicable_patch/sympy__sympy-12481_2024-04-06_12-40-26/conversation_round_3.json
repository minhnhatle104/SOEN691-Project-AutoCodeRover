The issue mentions a problem with the constructor when non-disjoint cycles are passed to it, which suggests that we should look into how the constructor (`__new__` method) handles its arguments, particularly how it deals with cycles.\n\nThe `Permutation` class does not explicitly show a constructor that takes cycles as input in the provided information. However, it's common for such functionality to be implemented in either the `__new__` method or through class methods that serve as alternative constructors. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that the handling of cycles (especially non-disjoint ones) is not properly implemented or is missing.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to understand how cycles are supposed to be converted into the permutation they represent and ensure that non-disjoint cycles are handled correctly by applying them in left-to-right order as specified in the issue description. This might involve modifying the `__new__` method or adding/improving a class method that deals with cycle input.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve:\n1. Examining the `__new__` method to understand how it currently processes its arguments.\n2. Looking for any class methods that might be responsible for handling cycle input, such as a method that converts cycles to the permutation's internal representation (array form or cyclic form).\n\nThis analysis will help us identify where the bug is and how to approach fixing it."

        "content": "The collected context from the `__new__` method in the `Permutation` class provides significant insights into how permutations are constructed and the current limitations regarding non-disjoint cycles. The method supports various forms of input for creating a permutation, including array form and cyclic form. However, the handling of cyclic input appears to be strict regarding disjoint cycles. The code explicitly checks for repeated elements when cycles are provided and raises a `ValueError` if duplicates are found. This behavior is the root cause of the issue reported.\n\nThe `from_sequence` method, on the other hand, is designed to return the permutation needed to obtain a sequence from its sorted elements. This method does not directly relate to the issue at hand but provides additional context on how permutations can be constructed from sequences.\n\n### Analysis of the `__new__` Method\n\n1. **Non-disjoint Cycles Handling**: The constructor does not currently support non-disjoint cycles as input. It checks for repeated elements (`has_dups(temp)`) and raises an error if any are found. This behavior contradicts the issue's requirement, where non-disjoint cycles should be applied in left-to-right order to construct the resulting permutation.\n\n2. **Error Messages**: The error messages provided when encountering repeated elements or missing integers in the input are clear but do not accommodate the use case of non-disjoint cycles.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nTo address the issue, the `__new__` method needs to be modified to allow non-disjoint cycles as valid input. This involves changing how input cycles are validated and processed. Specifically, the method should:\n\n- Allow non-disjoint cycles by removing or modifying the check that raises a `ValueError` for repeated elements in the case of cycle input.\n- Apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order to construct the resulting permutation. This may require a more sophisticated handling of cycle input to merge or apply cycles correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe bug is located in the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class within the file `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. The issue stems from the method's inability to handle non-disjoint cycles as input for constructing permutations. To resolve the issue, the method's input validation and cycle processing logic need to be updated to support and correctly apply non-disjoint cycles."
