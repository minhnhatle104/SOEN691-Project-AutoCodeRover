Given the constraints of our current setup, I've identified the location and nature of the issue within the Django project based on the details shared through search results and the description of the problem.\n\nThe identified location of the bug is:\n- **File**: `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`\n- **Method**: `EnumSerializer.serialize`\n\nThis method is pinpointed based on the analysis of the search results and the understanding of how Django handles the serialization of Enums in migration files, which is at the heart of the issue described.\n\nGiven the format of our interaction and the tools at our disposal, this is the most precise identification possible. Direct access to the codebase for debugging, further exploration, or making changes is beyond the scope of our current capabilities.\n\nIf there are specific aspects of the issue that require further clarification or if there's another direction you'd like to explore, please let me know how I can assist within the given constraints."
