This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object.\nThe problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)\nExample:\nLet say we have this code in models.py:\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Status(Enum):\nGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\nBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\ndef __str__(self):\nreturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\nstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\nIn the generated migration file, the code will be:\n...\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status('Good'), max_length=128))\n...\nAfter the translation, 'Good' will be translated to another word and it will not be part of the Status Enum class any more, so the migration file will raise the error on the previous line:\nValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status\nShouldn't the code generated by the migration uses the name of the Status Enum 'GOOD', not the value of it, since it is changeable?\nIt should be:\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status['GOOD'], max_length=128))\nThis will be correct regardless of the translated word\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the migration files are generated and how the default values for fields, especially those involving Enums, are handled in the Django project. The issue specifically mentions the use of Enum objects as default values in models and the problem arising from the migration system using the Enum's value instead of its name. This is crucial when dealing with translations where the Enum value might change based on the user's language, leading to errors in migrations that expect a specific, untranslated value.\n\nGiven this context, we should focus on the parts of the Django codebase responsible for generating migration files and handling default values for model fields. Specifically, we need to look into how Enums are treated in this process. Here are the API calls we should make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. **Search for the `CharField` class**: Since the issue mentions that the problem occurs with a `CharField` using an Enum as a default value, understanding how `CharField` handles default values could be key.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CharField\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for migration file generation logic**: The issue is with the migration file's content, so we need to find where and how Django generates these files.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"make_migration\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for Enum handling in migrations**: Since the specific problem is with how Enum values are handled in migrations, we should look for any code that specifically deals with Enums in this context.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"Enum\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to find the relevant parts of the Django codebase that could contribute to the issue described, providing a foundation for proposing a patch."

        "content": "Based on the search results, let's analyze the context we've gathered to understand how it relates to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **CharField Class in Django**:\n   - The search for `CharField` returned two results, one from `django/forms/fields.py` and another from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The relevant class for our issue is the second one, located in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, as it pertains to model fields, which is where the issue occurs. This class has methods like `__init__`, `check`, `to_python`, `get_prep_value`, and `formfield`, which could potentially interact with default values and their handling. However, there's no direct indication from the method names that they deal with Enums specifically.\n\n2. **Migration File Generation Logic**:\n   - The search for a method named `make_migration` did not yield any results. This suggests that the method name might be incorrect or that the logic for generating migration files is not encapsulated in a single method with this name. Migration file generation in Django is a complex process that likely involves multiple components and steps. The absence of a direct hit for `make_migration` means we might need to look into the Django migrations framework more broadly to understand how it handles default values and Enums.\n\n3. **Enum Handling in Migrations**:\n   - The search for code snippets containing `Enum` returned 60 matches across various files, including `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, `django/db/models/enums.py`, and several test files. The presence of `Enum` in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` is particularly interesting because it suggests that Enums are explicitly considered during the serialization process of migrations. This file could contain logic that determines how Enum values are represented in migration files, which is directly related to the issue.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps towards addressing the issue would involve:\n- **Exploring `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`**: Since this file likely deals with how objects, including Enums, are serialized for migrations, it could contain the logic that leads to the use of Enum values instead of names. Understanding and potentially modifying this logic could be key to resolving the issue.\n- **Understanding CharField Default Value Handling**: Although the search did not directly point to how `CharField` handles default values, especially Enums, examining the implementation of methods like `get_prep_value` and `to_python` in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` could provide insights into where the conversion from Enum to its value happens and how it might be intercepted or modified.\n- **Broadening the Search for Migration Logic**: Since the direct search for `make_migration` was unsuccessful, a broader exploration of Django's migration framework might be necessary. This could involve looking into how migration files are structured, generated, and how default values are encoded within them.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for a deeper dive into the identified components of the Django codebase to formulate a solution to the issue."
