Since the initial search did not provide the full implementation details of this method, we should construct a more targeted search to get the exact implementation details of the `EnumSerializer.serialize` method. This will help in pinpointing the exact location and nature of the bug.\n\n- **Do we need more context**:\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_file(\"serialize\", \"django/db/migrations/serializer.py\")\n    ```\n\nThis search is aimed at getting the full implementation of the `serialize` method within the `EnumSerializer` class from the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file, which is suspected to contain the logic that leads to the issue described in the bug report."
