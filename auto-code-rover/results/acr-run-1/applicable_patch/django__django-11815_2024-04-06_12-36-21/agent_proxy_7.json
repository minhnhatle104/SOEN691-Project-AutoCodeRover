Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I've identified the `EnumSerializer.serialize` method within `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` as the location related to the issue described in the initial problem statement. This identification is based on the detailed analysis of the search results and the understanding of the issue as it was described.\n\nTo address the issue directly:\n- The bug is located in the `EnumSerializer.serialize` method in the file `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`.\n- This method currently serializes Enum values by their actual value (`self.value.value`), which can lead to issues when these values are subject to translation.\n\nIf further precision or additional exploration within the codebase is required beyond this identification, it would typically involve direct access to the codebase for a more thorough investigation, including debugging and testing potential fixes. Given the format of our interaction, I've provided the most accurate analysis possible based on the information available.\n\nIf there's a misunderstanding or a need for additional types of information that can be provided within this format, please specify, and I'll do my best to assist further."
