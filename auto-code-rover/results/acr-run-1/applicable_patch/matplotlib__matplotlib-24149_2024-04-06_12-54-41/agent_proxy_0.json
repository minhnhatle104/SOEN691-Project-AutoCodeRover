We should also look into the `_convert_dx` method and `_safe_first_finite` function since they are directly involved in the exception. Let's start by searching for these key components:\n\n1. Search for the `Axes.bar` method to understand how it processes the input data and why it might be failing with all NaN data.\n2. Search for the `_convert_dx` method within the `Axes` class to see how width calculations are handled and why NaN values might be causing issues.\n3. Search for the `_safe_first_finite` function to understand its role in filtering input data and why it's raising a `StopIteration` exception.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"bar\", \"Axes\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"_convert_dx\", \"Axes\")\nsearch_code(\"_safe_first_finite\")\n```"
