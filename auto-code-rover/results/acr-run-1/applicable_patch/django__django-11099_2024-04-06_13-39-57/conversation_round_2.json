However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

They inherit from `validators.RegexValidator` and define a `regex` attribute that matches the description provided in the issue. The regex pattern used in both validators is `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'`, which, as mentioned in the issue, incorrectly allows usernames to end with a newline due to the behavior of the `$` character in Python regex.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to modify the `regex` attribute in both validators to use `\\A` and `\\Z` instead of `^` and `$` to ensure that usernames cannot end with a newline. The updated regex pattern should be `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps involve preparing patches for both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` within the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file to replace the current `regex` attribute with the corrected version. This change will ensure that the validators function as intended, rejecting usernames that end with a newline."
