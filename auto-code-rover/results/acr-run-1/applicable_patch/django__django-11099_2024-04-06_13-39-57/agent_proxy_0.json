Since the issue mentions that these validators are part of `contrib.auth.validators`, it's likely that they are defined in a specific file related to authentication validators. However, without the exact file path, we'll start by searching for these classes to understand their current implementation and where they are defined. \n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"ASCIIUsernameValidator\")`\n2. `search_class(\"UnicodeUsernameValidator\")`\n\nThese calls will help us locate the classes and understand their current implementation, specifically how the regex is being used within them."
