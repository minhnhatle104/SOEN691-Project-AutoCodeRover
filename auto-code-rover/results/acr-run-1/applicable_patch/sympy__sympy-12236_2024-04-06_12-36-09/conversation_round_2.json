        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, we can start analyzing the issue and the relevant parts of the codebase to understand the problem better and work towards a solution.\n\n### Analysis of `apart` Function\n\nThe `apart` function is implemented in two places within the codebase:\n\n1. **sympy/polys/partfrac.py**: This is the primary implementation of the `apart` function. It provides a detailed explanation of how the partial fraction decomposition is performed, mentioning two algorithms: the undetermined coefficients method (default) and Bronstein's full partial fraction decomposition algorithm. The function handles various cases, including commutative and non-commutative expressions, and has special handling for multivariate expressions and expressions involving `RootSum`. This implementation is quite complex, indicating that the issue might stem from how the algorithm deals with the specific expression or the properties of the symbols involved.\n\n2. **sympy/core/expr.py**: Here, the `apart` method is a member of the `Expr` class, which simply delegates the operation to the `apart` function defined in `sympy.polys`. This indicates that any expression object can call `apart` directly, which is consistent with the usage in the issue description.\n\n### Analysis of `symbols` Function\n\nThe search for the `symbols` function revealed it is defined in multiple files, with the primary definition likely in `sympy/core/symbol.py`. Although the search results don't provide the implementation details, it's clear that `symbols` is a fundamental part of creating symbolic variables in SymPy. The issue might not directly stem from `symbols` itself but rather from how the properties assigned to symbols (e.g., `real=True`, `negative=False`) interact with the `apart` function.\n\n### Analysis of the Expression\n\nThe specific expression causing the issue was not found directly in the codebase, which is not surprising given it's likely part of user code rather than the SymPy library itself. However, this expression is a good test case to understand how the `apart` function handles expressions with certain characteristics, such as division by an expression that simplifies to a constant under certain conditions.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps could involve:\n\n1. **Testing the `apart` Function**: Create unit tests or scripts that replicate the issue using the expression provided in the bug report. This can help determine if the issue is consistent across different environments or SymPy versions.\n\n2. **Reviewing Algorithm Implementation**: Dive deeper into the implementation of both the undetermined coefficients method and Bronstein's algorithm within the `apart` function to see if there are edge cases or assumptions that might not hold for the given expression.\n\n3. **Symbol Properties Interaction**: Investigate how the properties of symbols (e.g., being real or non-negative) are used within the `apart` function and whether they could affect the outcome in unexpected ways.\n\n4. **Documentation and Examples**: Review the documentation and examples provided in the `apart` function to see if there are similar cases or if the documentation could be improved to cover this scenario.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for debugging the issue and potentially identifying a patch or workaround."
