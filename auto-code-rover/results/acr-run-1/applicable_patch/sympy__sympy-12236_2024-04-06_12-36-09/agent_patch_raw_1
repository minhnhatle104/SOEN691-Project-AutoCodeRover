Given the context and the nature of the issue, it appears that the problem might be related to how the `apart` function handles expressions with certain symbol properties, specifically when symbols are marked as real and/or non-negative. However, without a specific error or misbehavior pinpointed in the implementation details from the provided code snippets, suggesting an exact patch is challenging. 

A common approach to resolving such issues would involve enhancing the handling of symbol properties within the decomposition process or ensuring that expressions are correctly simplified before or after the decomposition. Since the exact cause of the issue isn't clear from the provided context, a hypothetical patch might involve adding additional checks or simplification steps to the `apart` function in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`.

Please note, the following patch is speculative and intended as an illustrative example based on the general analysis of the issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/polys/partfrac.py</file>
<original>
if Q.degree() <= 1:
    partial = P/Q
else:
    if not full:
        partial = apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q)
    else:
        partial = apart_full_decomposition(P, Q)
</original>
<patched>
if Q.degree() <= 1:
    partial = P/Q
else:
    if not full:
        partial = apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q)
    else:
        partial = apart_full_decomposition(P, Q)

# Attempt to simplify the expression further if it involves symbols with specific properties
if any(sym.is_real or sym.is_nonnegative for sym in f.free_symbols):
    partial = simplify(partial)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/polys/partfrac.py</file>
<original>
return common*(poly.as_expr() + terms)
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure the final expression is simplified considering symbol properties
result = common*(poly.as_expr() + terms)
if any(sym.is_real or sym.is_nonnegative for sym in f.free_symbols):
    result = simplify(result)
return result
</patched>
```

These modifications suggest adding a step to simplify the partial fraction decomposition result when the expression involves symbols marked as real or non-negative. The `simplify` function is a general-purpose tool in SymPy that attempts to simplify expressions, but it should be used with caution as it can be computationally expensive and may not always produce a more desirable form for every use case.

Remember, any modification to a library like SymPy should be thoroughly tested with a wide range of expressions to ensure that it does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior.
