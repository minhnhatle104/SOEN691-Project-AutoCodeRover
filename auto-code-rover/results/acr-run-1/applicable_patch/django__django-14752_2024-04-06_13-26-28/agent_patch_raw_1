This patch refactors the `get` method in the `AutocompleteJsonView` class to use a new method, `serialize_results`, which in turn calls `serialize_result` for each object in the queryset. This change allows developers to easily customize the autocomplete response by overriding the `serialize_result` method in a subclass, adding any extra fields as needed without having to override the entire `get` method. This approach reduces the maintenance overhead and makes the code more modular and easier to extend.
