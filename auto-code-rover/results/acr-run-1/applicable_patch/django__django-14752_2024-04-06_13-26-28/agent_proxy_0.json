Here are the API calls that would help in understanding the current implementation and how to best introduce the changes:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AutocompleteJsonView\")`: This will help us find where the `AutocompleteJsonView` class is defined within the project. Understanding its current implementation and structure is crucial for adding the new feature.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"AutocompleteJsonView\")`: This call will provide us with the current implementation of the `get` method within the `AutocompleteJsonView` class. Knowing how `get` is currently implemented will allow us to understand the changes needed to refactor it.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"serialize_result\", \"AutocompleteJsonView\")`: Although this method does not exist yet, this call is intended to check if there's any method with a similar purpose already implemented. If there is, we might need to consider its current functionality or refactor it to fit the new requirements.\n\nThese API calls will provide a solid foundation for understanding the current state of the `AutocompleteJsonView` class and how to implement the proposed changes effectively."
