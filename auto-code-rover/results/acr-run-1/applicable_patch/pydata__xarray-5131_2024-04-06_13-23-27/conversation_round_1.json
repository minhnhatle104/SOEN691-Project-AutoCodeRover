        "content": "<issue>Trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy text representation\nWhen displaying a DatasetGroupBy in an interactive Python session, the first line of output contains a trailing whitespace. The first example in the documentation demonstrate this:\n```pycon\n>>> import xarray as xr, numpy as np\n>>> ds = xr.Dataset(\n...     {\"foo\": ((\"x\", \"y\"), np.random.rand(4, 3))},\n...     coords={\"x\": [10, 20, 30, 40], \"letters\": (\"x\", list(\"abba\"))},\n... )\n>>> ds.groupby(\"letters\")\nDatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters'\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\n```\nThere is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output which is \"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \". This can be seen more clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before `\\n`):\n```pycon\n>>> str(ds.groupby(\"letters\"))\n\"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\"\n```\nWhile this isn't a problem in itself, it causes an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code is correctly formatted and we also have doctests that rely on DatasetGroupBy textual representation. Flake8 reports a violation on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctests fail because the expected output doesn't match the actual output. So we have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable. Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctest want the expected output to be exactly the same as the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference. We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violation for the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunately it's not possible to just add `# NoQA` comments to get flake8 to ignore the violation only for specific lines because that creates a difference between expected and actual output from doctest point of view. Flake8 doesn't allow to disable checks for blocks of code either.\nIs there a reason for having this trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy representation? Whould it be OK to remove it? If so please let me know and I can make a pull request.\n</issue>"

However, a direct search for the `__repr__` method within the `DatasetGroupBy` class did not yield any results. This suggests that the `__repr__` method might not be explicitly defined within the `DatasetGroupBy` class itself. There are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Inheritance**: The `DatasetGroupBy` class might inherit the `__repr__` method from a parent class. The search result indicates that `DatasetGroupBy` inherits from `GroupBy` and `ImplementsDatasetReduce`. It's possible that one of these parent classes defines the `__repr__` method that `DatasetGroupBy` uses.\n\n2. **Dynamic or Indirect Representation Generation**: The string representation might be generated through a more dynamic or indirect approach, not using a straightforward `__repr__` method. This could involve methods that are called within the context of string representation but are not named `__repr__`.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the next steps in our investigation should involve:\n\n1. Searching for the `__repr__` method in the parent classes (`GroupBy` and `ImplementsDatasetReduce`) to see if `DatasetGroupBy` inherits its string representation from one of them.\n2. Looking for other methods within `DatasetGroupBy` or its parent classes that could be responsible for generating the string representation. This might include methods that are typically used for formatting or methods that are explicitly called when converting an object to a string.\n\nTo proceed, I will make the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"GroupBy\")`: To check if the `__repr__` method is defined in the `GroupBy` class.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"ImplementsDatasetReduce\")`: To check if the `__repr__` method is defined in the `ImplementsDatasetReduce` class.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_repr_html_\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`: Since some objects provide HTML representations for Jupyter notebooks and similar environments, it's worth checking if a custom method like `_repr_html_` exists and could be related to the issue.\n4. `search_method_in_file(\"def __str__\", \"xarray/core/groupby.py\")`: To check if there's a `__str__` method in the same file that might be used for the string representation instead of `__repr__`."
