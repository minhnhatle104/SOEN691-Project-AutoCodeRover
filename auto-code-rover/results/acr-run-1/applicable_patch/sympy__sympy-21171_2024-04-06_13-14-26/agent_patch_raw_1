Explanation:
- The patch modifies the `_print_SingularityFunction` method in the `LatexPrinter` class to accept arbitrary keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). This change ensures that if the method is called with unexpected keyword arguments (such as `exp` in the reported issue), it can gracefully ignore them or pass them along to other methods that might require them, without causing a `TypeError`.
- Additionally, when calling `self._print` for `shift` and `power`, the method now passes along these `**kwargs`. This ensures that any keyword arguments received by `_print_SingularityFunction` are also considered in subsequent calls, maintaining consistency and flexibility in handling keyword arguments throughout the printing process.
