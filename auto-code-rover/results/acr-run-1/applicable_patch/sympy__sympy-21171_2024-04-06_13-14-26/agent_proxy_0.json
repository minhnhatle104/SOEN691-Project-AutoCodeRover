            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about where and how the `_print_SingularityFunction()` method is implemented and used, especially in relation to the `latex` function which seems to be the source of the error. Given the traceback, it's clear that the error originates from a call to `_print_SingularityFunction()` with an unexpected keyword argument `exp`. This suggests that there might be an issue with how keyword arguments are handled or passed in the printing or latex rendering process of `SingularityFunction` objects.\n\nLet's start by investigating the relevant classes and methods:\n\n1. Since the error mentions `_print_SingularityFunction()`, it's crucial to find out which class this method belongs to. This will help us understand the context in which the method is expected to operate.\n2. The traceback also involves the `latex` function, which is part of the process that leads to the error. Understanding how `latex` interacts with `_print_SingularityFunction()` could provide insights into the cause of the issue.\n\nBased on these points, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_method(\"_print_SingularityFunction\")`: This will help us locate the definition of `_print_SingularityFunction()` and understand its implementation details.\n- `search_method(\"latex\")`: This will provide context on how the `latex` function is implemented and how it might be related to the issue at hand."
