Based on the issue description and the provided context, the core problem seems to be related to updating the colorbar after changing the `norm` of the mappable, specifically to a `LogNorm`. The `ZeroDivisionError` suggests that there might be an issue in handling cases where `vmin` could be zero or very close to zero, which is problematic for logarithmic scales.

Given the context, a direct patch to address the `ZeroDivisionError` and ensure the colorbar updates correctly when the norm changes to `LogNorm` is not straightforward without a deeper dive into the `LogNorm` class itself, which was not directly provided. However, we can propose a workaround in the colorbar update mechanism to handle the `LogNorm` case more gracefully.

This workaround involves checking if the `norm` is an instance of `LogNorm` and ensuring that `vmin` and `vmax` are handled in a way that avoids division by zero. This is a speculative solution and should be tested thoroughly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py</file>
<original>if mappable.norm != self.norm:
            self.norm = mappable.norm
            self._reset_locator_formatter_scale()</original>
<patched>if mappable.norm != self.norm:
            self.norm = mappable.norm
            # Handle LogNorm case to avoid ZeroDivisionError
            if isinstance(self.norm, matplotlib.colors.LogNorm):
                if self.norm.vmin <= 0:
                    self.norm.vmin = self.norm.vmax * 1e-3
            self._reset_locator_formatter_scale()</patched>
```

This patch checks if the new norm is an instance of `LogNorm` and adjusts `vmin` to be a small fraction of `vmax` if it is less than or equal to zero. This adjustment aims to prevent the `ZeroDivisionError` when `vmin` is zero or negative, which is not valid for logarithmic scales. Note that `1e-3` is chosen arbitrarily as a small value relative to `vmax`; this value might need adjustment based on the specific requirements or data range of the application.

Please note, this patch is a workaround aimed at addressing the specific issue described and might not cover all edge cases or scenarios. Further investigation and a more comprehensive solution might be required for a robust fix.
