Based on the context and the issue described, it seems that the `socket.error` is already being caught and re-raised as a `ConnectionError` in the `send` method of the `HTTPAdapter` class. This is the expected behavior for handling such low-level exceptions in a high-level library like `requests`. However, the user's issue suggests that there might be specific scenarios where this exception handling does not catch or wrap the `socket.error` as expected.

Given the information and the code provided, it appears that the handling of `socket.error` is implemented correctly in the provided `send` method snippet. Therefore, without specific details on the scenario where the error handling fails or additional parts of the code where `socket.error` might not be caught, proposing a direct patch is challenging.

However, to ensure robustness and to potentially address unseen gaps, one approach could be to broaden the exception handling to catch more general exceptions and ensure they are wrapped as `ConnectionError`. This is more of a precautionary measure rather than a direct fix based on identified bugs.

# modification 1
```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>except socket.error as sockerr:
    raise ConnectionError(sockerr, request=request)</original>
<patched>except (socket.error, OSError) as e:
    raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)</patched>
```

This modification broadens the catch to include `OSError`, which is a parent class of `socket.error` in Python 3, ensuring that any OS-level network errors are also caught and wrapped appropriately. This change might not directly address the user's issue if their problem lies elsewhere in the code or in specific usage scenarios not covered by this snippet. However, it could prevent similar issues related to error handling in the future.

Without more specific details on the failure scenario or additional problematic code snippets, it's difficult to provide further targeted modifications. The user's issue might also stem from interactions with other libraries (like `gevent` as seen in the traceback) or specific network conditions, which would require a different approach to diagnose and fix.
