Given the constraints and the need for a non-whitespace original code snippet, let's focus on adding the `__repr__` method directly after the `__init__` method for both classes, ensuring we reference actual code lines that exist in the classes. Since the exact original code snippet including comments and documentation strings was problematic, we'll focus on the `__init__` method's closing line, which is a concrete part of the class definition.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/model_selection/_split.py</file>
<original>super().__init__(
            KFold, n_repeats, random_state, n_splits=n_splits)</original>
<patched>super().__init__(
            KFold, n_repeats, random_state, n_splits=n_splits)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})"</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/model_selection/_split.py</file>
<original>super().__init__(
            StratifiedKFold, n_repeats, random_state, n_splits=n_splits)</original>
<patched>super().__init__(
            StratifiedKFold, n_repeats, random_state, n_splits=n_splits)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})"</patched>
```

These modifications directly follow the `__init__` method's last line in both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. By doing so, we ensure that the `__repr__` method is added to provide a meaningful string representation of the class instances, addressing the issue reported.
