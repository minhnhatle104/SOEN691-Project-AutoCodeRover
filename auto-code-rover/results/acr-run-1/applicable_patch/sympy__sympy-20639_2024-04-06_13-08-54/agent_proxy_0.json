            "content": "To address the issue related to the inaccurate rendering of `pi**(1/E)`, we need to gather more context about how the rendering is implemented in the project. The issue mentions a discrepancy in the pretty printing module, so we should focus on classes or methods related to rendering or pretty printing expressions. Additionally, since the issue specifically mentions LaTeX and string representations behaving correctly, we should also look into how these representations are generated to understand the difference.\n\nGiven the information, the following API calls would be relevant:\n\n1. `search_code(\"printing.pretty\")`: This will help us find the module or file that handles pretty printing, which seems to be directly related to the issue.\n2. `search_method(\"latex\")`: Since the issue mentions that LaTeX representation is correct, finding the `latex` method could provide insights into how expressions are correctly transformed into LaTeX format, which might help in understanding where the pretty printing goes wrong.\n3. `search_method(\"str\")`: Similarly, understanding how the string representation (`str`) is generated for expressions might give clues about the discrepancy in pretty printing.\n\nThese searches aim to locate the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the rendering of expressions in different formats, which is crucial for diagnosing the issue with pretty printing."
