Given the error message and the context provided in the issue, the following API calls seem necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the `Line3D` class**: This will help us understand the structure of the class and see if `_verts3d` is indeed an attribute of this class, and how it is supposed to be used or set.\n\n2. **Search for methods in the `Line3D` class**: Since the error involves an attribute not being found, it's possible that there's a method responsible for setting or updating `_verts3d` that isn't being called correctly. We need to find methods within `Line3D` that interact with `_verts3d`.\n\n3. **Search for the `draw` method in the `Line3D` class**: The stack trace indicates that the error occurs during a draw operation. It would be useful to see how `Line3D`'s `draw` method is implemented and how it interacts with `_verts3d`.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following API calls will be made:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Line3D\")`\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"draw\", \"Line3D\")`"
