When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console. I don't know why it happens, so I come here for help.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nx_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nx_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\ny_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\ny_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nz_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nz_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\nax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\nax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\nclr_list = 'r-'\nfor n in range(np.size(z_s_0, axis=0)):\nax.plot([int(x_s_0[n]), int(x_e_0[n])],\n[int(y_s_0[n]), int(y_e_0[n])],\n[int(z_s_0[n]), int(z_e_0[n])], clr_list)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\n# ax.zlabel('z')\nplt.title('90-0')\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 3444, in run_code\nexec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\nFile \"<ipython-input-80-e04907066a16>\", line 20, in <module>\nplt.show()\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 368, in show\nreturn _backend_mod.show(*args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 29, in __call__\nmanager.show(**kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 112, in show\nself.canvas.show()\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 68, in show\nFigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\", line 436, in draw\nself.figure.draw(self.renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 73, in draw_wrapper\nresult = draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py\", line 2803, in draw\nmimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\na.draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 469, in draw\nsuper().draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", line 3082, in draw\nmimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\na.draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 215, in draw\nxs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d\nAttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Expected outcome\nSome 3D lines\n### Additional information\n_No response_\n### Operating system\nLocal: windows + pycharm, Remote: Ubuntu 20.04\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.5.0\n### Matplotlib Backend\nmodule://backend_interagg\n### Python version\n3.8.12\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\npip\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified key components related to the issue reported:\n\n1. **`Line3D` Class**: Located in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py`, the `Line3D` class is a subclass of `lines.Line2D`. It includes several methods relevant to 3D line objects in Matplotlib, such as `__init__`, `set_3d_properties`, `set_data_3d`, `get_data_3d`, and notably, `draw`.\n\n2. **`draw` Method in `Line3D`**: The `draw` method attempts to access `self._verts3d`, which is presumably a tuple or list containing the x, y, and z coordinates of the vertices. These coordinates are then transformed using `proj3d.proj_transform` and set as the data for the 2D representation of the line, which is then drawn using the superclass's `draw` method.\n\nThe issue described in the bug report occurs when the attribute `_verts3d` is not found in the `Line3D` object. This suggests that `_verts3d` is expected to be set or initialized before the `draw` method is called, but in some cases, it is not. Given the methods available in the `Line3D` class, it's likely that either `set_3d_properties` or `set_data_3d` is responsible for initializing or updating `_verts3d`.\n\nTo address the issue, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Ensure `_verts3d` Initialization**: We need to ensure that `_verts3d` is properly initialized or set before the `draw` method is called. This could involve modifying either the `__init__` method to include a default initialization of `_verts3d`, or ensuring that methods like `set_3d_properties` or `set_data_3d` are always called with the necessary data to populate `_verts3d`.\n\n2. **Error Handling in `draw`**: It may be beneficial to add error handling or a check in the `draw` method to ensure that `_verts3d` exists. If it does not, the method could raise a more informative error or attempt to recover gracefully.\n\n3. **Documentation and Examples**: Updating the documentation and examples to clearly demonstrate the correct usage of `Line3D` objects, including the necessity of setting 3D properties or data before attempting to draw, could help prevent similar issues.\n\nTo proceed with creating a patch, we would need to review the implementations of `set_3d_properties` and `set_data_3d` to understand how `_verts3d` is supposed to be set. This would involve further examination of the `Line3D` class code, particularly focusing on these methods."
