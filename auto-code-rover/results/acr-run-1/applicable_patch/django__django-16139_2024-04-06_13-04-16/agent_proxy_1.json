However, reviewing related tests in `tests/auth_tests/test_forms.py` could be beneficial to ensure that any changes made do not break existing functionality and to potentially add new tests that cover this scenario. But for the purpose of fixing the described issue, no further context is required.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n\nBuggy file and method:\n- **File**: `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`\n- **Method**: The `__init__` method within the `UserChangeForm` class.\n\nThis method incorrectly formats the `password` field's `help_text` with a relative path that does not account for access via a non-primary key field (`to_field`), leading to a broken link in certain scenarios."
