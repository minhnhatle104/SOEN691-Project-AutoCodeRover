The `help_text` for this field includes an HTML anchor tag that is supposed to link to the password change form. The placeholder `{}` in the `help_text` is intended to be formatted with the correct URL to the password change form.\n\n2. **Usage of `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`**:\n   - The search for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` confirmed its usage within `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`, which is where our `UserChangeForm` is defined. This field is specifically designed to handle password fields in a read-only manner within the Django admin, which aligns with the issue described.\n   - The fact that there are matches in `tests/auth_tests/test_forms.py` suggests there are tests that might be relevant to our issue, especially in terms of how the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` is expected to behave in different scenarios.\n\n3. **Implementation of `__init__` in `UserChangeForm`**:\n   - The `__init__` method of the `UserChangeForm` is responsible for customizing the form upon initialization. It\'s here that the `password` field\'s `help_text` is formatted with a relative URL `"../password/"`. This is identified as the source of the issue since this relative path does not correctly resolve when the `UserAdmin` is accessed via a non-primary key field (`to_field` set to something other than the default primary key).\n\n**Analysis**:\nThe core of the issue lies in the `__init__` method of the `UserChangeForm`, where the `password` field\'s `help_text` is formatted with a relative path that assumes the form is always accessed via its primary key in the URL. When accessed via a `to_field` that is not the primary key (e.g., a UUID), this assumption breaks, leading to a 404 error when attempting to use the password reset link.\n\n**Solution Approach**:\nThe proposed solution in the issue description suggests modifying the way the `password` field\'s `help_text` is formatted. Instead of using a static relative path, it suggests dynamically constructing the path based on the instance\'s primary key. This approach should resolve the issue by ensuring the password reset link is always correct, regardless of how the `UserAdmin` is accessed.\n\nNext steps would involve implementing the proposed solution, testing it thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new ones, and considering any implications this change might have on existing functionality or security.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

             '**Analysis**:\n'
             "The core of the issue lies in the `__init__` method of the `UserChangeForm`, where the `password` field's `help_text` is formatted with a "
             'relative path that assumes the form is always accessed via its primary key in the URL. When accessed via a `to_field` that is not the primary '
             'key (e.g., a UUID), this assumption breaks, leading to a 404 error when attempting to use the password reset link.\n'
             '\n'
             '**Solution Approach**:\n'
             "The proposed solution in the issue description suggests modifying the way the `password` field's `help_text` is formatted. Instead of using a "
             "static relative path, it suggests dynamically constructing the path based on the instance's primary key. This approach should resolve the issue "
             'by ensuring the password reset link is always correct, regardless of how the `UserAdmin` is accessed.\n'
             '\n'
             'Next steps would involve implementing the proposed solution, testing it thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new ones, '
             'and considering any implications this change might have on existing functionality or security.'},
