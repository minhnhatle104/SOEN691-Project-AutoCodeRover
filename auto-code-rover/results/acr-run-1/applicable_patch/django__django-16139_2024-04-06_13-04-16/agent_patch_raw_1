```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/forms.py</file>
<original>            password.help_text = password.help_text.format("../password/")</original>
<patched>            password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/")</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by dynamically constructing the URL for the password reset link based on the instance's primary key (`self.instance.pk`). This ensures that the link is always correct, regardless of how the `UserAdmin` is accessed, thus resolving the 404 error when attempting to use the password reset link in scenarios where `UserAdmin` is accessed via a non-primary key field (`to_field`).
