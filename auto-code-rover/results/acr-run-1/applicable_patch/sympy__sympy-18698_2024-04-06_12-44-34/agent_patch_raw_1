Given the context and the issue described, it seems the inconsistency in the output of the `sqf_list` function might be related to how multiplicities are handled or aggregated. However, without specific details on the incorrect behavior beyond the provided examples, we'll focus on a general approach that could address potential issues in handling multiplicities.

The issue might stem from how the results from the lower-level `dmp_sqf_list` function are processed and returned. A common issue in such scenarios could be the incorrect aggregation or interpretation of multiplicities, especially when combining factors from different parts of the polynomial.

Since the provided code snippets do not directly show a clear bug, the patch will be speculative, aimed at ensuring multiplicities are handled consistently. We'll focus on the `Poly` class's `sqf_list` method in `polytools.py`, as it's a central point where polynomial inputs are processed and could benefit from additional checks or normalization of output.

    for base, exp in factors:
        if base in normalized_factors:
            normalized_factors[base] += exp
        else:
            normalized_factors[base] = exp
    normalized_factors_list = [(f.per(g), k) for g, k in normalized_factors.items()]
else:  # pragma: no cover
    raise OperationNotSupported(f, 'sqf_list')

return f.rep.dom.to_sympy(coeff), normalized_factors_list</patched>
```

This modification introduces a normalization step for the factors and their multiplicities. It ensures that if the same base factor is encountered multiple times (potentially due to different paths in the factorization process), its multiplicities are summed up, rather than listed separately. This approach could address issues where the same factor appears with different multiplicities due to inconsistencies in the factorization process or the handling of the `all` parameter.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on a general understanding of the issue. Actual implementation might require deeper investigation into the specific cause of the inconsistency reported.
