        "content": "Based on the issue description, the problem lies with the `sqf_list` function, which is supposed to decompose a polynomial into square-free factors along with their multiplicities. The issue points out an inconsistency in the output, particularly with the handling of multiplicities.\n\nGiven the search results, we have identified that the `sqf_list` method appears in multiple files within the `sympy` library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. The files where `sqf_list` appears are:\n\n- `sympy/polys/polytools.py` (2 matches)\n- `sympy/polys/rings.py` (1 match)\n- `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py` (1 match)\n\nTo proceed with diagnosing and fixing the issue, we need to understand how `sqf_list` is implemented across these files and identify where the inconsistency in output could be originating from. Given that `polytools.py` contains two matches, it's likely a central place for polynomial manipulation functions, including `sqf_list`. The other files might offer specialized implementations or utilize the method in specific contexts.\n\nThe next steps should involve examining the implementation of `sqf_list` in `polytools.py` since it's probable that the core logic or a significant part of the issue resides there. Additionally, understanding how `sqf_list` is used or defined in `rings.py` and `polyclasses.py` could provide insights into how the method's behavior is extended or modified in different contexts within the `sympy` library.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most immediate action would be to review the implementation of `sqf_list` in `polytools.py` and compare it with the descriptions of the issue to identify discrepancies or potential areas for correction."
