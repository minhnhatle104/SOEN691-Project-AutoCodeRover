```python

<original>funcstr = funcprinter.doprint(funcname, iterable_args, _expr, cses=cses)</original>
<patched># Before generating the function string, check if the expression is a single-element tuple and adjust accordingly.
if isinstance(_expr, tuple) and len(_expr) == 1:
    _expr = (_expr[0],)  # Ensure the single-element tuple is preserved in the generated code.
funcstr = funcprinter.doprint(funcname, iterable_args, _expr, cses=cses)</patched>
```

This modification ensures that when the expression being passed to `lambdify` is a single-element tuple, it is correctly handled as such in the generated function string. This change addresses the issue where the Python code printer was not respecting tuples with one element, by explicitly ensuring the tuple's single element is followed by a comma in the generated code.
