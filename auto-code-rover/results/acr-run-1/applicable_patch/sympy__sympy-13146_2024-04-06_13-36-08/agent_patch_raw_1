<original>if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):
        expr = original_expr</original>
<patched>if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr) or expr.equals(original_expr):
        expr = S.Zero if original_expr.equals(S.Zero) else original_expr</patched>
```

Explanation:
The patch addresses the issue where the `simplify` function does not fully simplify expressions that should result in zero. By adding an additional check using the `equals` method, we can determine if the original expression is mathematically equivalent to zero. If so, we explicitly set the simplified expression to `S.Zero`. This ensures that expressions which are mathematically equivalent to zero but not simplified due to numerical precision issues or complex simplification heuristics are correctly simplified to zero. The `equals` method is used to perform a more thorough comparison than simple structural equality, which can help in cases where the expression involves floating-point numbers or complex symbolic manipulations.
