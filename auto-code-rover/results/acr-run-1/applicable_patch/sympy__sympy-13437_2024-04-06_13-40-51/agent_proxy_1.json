However, based on the current understanding and the information provided, we have a good starting point for addressing the issue. Additional context might be necessary as we delve into the implementation details, but for now, we can proceed with what we have.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n  - **Buggy files and methods**:\n    - **File**: `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`\n      - **Method**: `eval` within the `bell` class. This method likely needs to be modified to handle the case when `n=oo` appropriately, ensuring that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` evaluates to infinity (`oo`) rather than returning `bell(oo)` unevaluated.\n    - **File**: `sympy/series/limits.py`\n      - While not necessarily \"buggy,\" the implementation of the `limit` method in this file should be reviewed to understand how limits are computed and to see if there's a specific reason why `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` does not evaluate as expected. It's possible that the handling of the `bell` function within the context of limits needs to be adjusted or enhanced."
