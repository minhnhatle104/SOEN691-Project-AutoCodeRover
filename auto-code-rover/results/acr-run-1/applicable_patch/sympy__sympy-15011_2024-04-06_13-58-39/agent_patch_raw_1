Explanation:

- **Modification 1**: This patch ensures that the function arguments (`funcargs`) are correctly represented as strings, even if they contain special characters such as curly braces. By using `map(repr, funcargs)`, each argument is converted to its string representation in a way that is safe for inclusion in Python code. This change addresses potential issues with argument names that are not valid Python identifiers or contain special characters.

- **Modification 2**: This patch addresses the issue of curly braces in the expression part of the generated function. Since curly braces are used for formatting in Python strings, they need to be escaped by doubling them (`{{` and `}}`) when they are meant to appear in the resulting string literally. The `.replace('{', '{{').replace('}', '}}')` operation ensures that any curly braces in the expression are correctly escaped, preventing `SyntaxError` when the generated code is executed.

Please note: These patches are hypothetical solutions based on the analysis of the provided context and the nature of the issue described. Actual implementation and testing would be required to confirm their effectiveness and ensure they do not introduce other issues.
