For quick version checks, exposing either a `version_info` tuple (which can be compared with other tuples) or a `LooseVersion` instance (which can be properly compared with other strings) would be a small usability improvement.\n(In practice I guess boring string comparisons will work just fine until we hit mpl 3.10 or 4.10 which is unlikely to happen soon, but that feels quite dirty :))\n### Proposed Solution\nI guess I slightly prefer `LooseVersion`, but exposing just a `version_info` tuple is much more common in other packages (and perhaps simpler to understand).  The hardest(?) part is probably just bikeshedding this point :-)\n### Additional context and prior art\n`version_info` is a pretty common thing (citation needed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered some valuable context regarding how version information is currently handled in the project and the presence of version-related mechanisms.\n\n1. **Usage of `__version__`**:\n   - The `__version__` string is widely used across the codebase, with 47 snippets found in various files. Notably, it appears in `lib/matplotlib/_version.py`, which likely contains the primary definition or management of the version string. It also appears in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` with 10 matches, suggesting significant usage or handling of version information in the initialization of the library.\n   - Other mentions across different modules (`colors.py`, `figure.py`, `font_manager.py`, etc.) and backends (`backend_pdf.py`, `backend_qt5.py`, etc.) indicate that `__version__` is used for various purposes, possibly including compatibility checks, debugging, or informational logging.\n\n2. **Absence of `LooseVersion`**:\n   - The search did not find any instances of `LooseVersion` in the codebase. This suggests that if any version comparison mechanisms exist, they do not rely on `LooseVersion` from the `distutils.version` or similar modules. This aligns with the issue's suggestion that introducing a `LooseVersion` or a similar mechanism could be beneficial for more robust version comparisons.\n\n3. **Presence of `version_info`**:\n   - The term `version_info` appears in 6 snippets within the codebase, including in `setup.py` and a few specific backend and testing files. This indicates that there is some precedent for using a `version_info`-like tuple for version handling or comparison, though it seems to be used less frequently and less centrally than `__version__`.\n\nGiven this context, the issue's proposal to add a more easily comparable version information mechanism, such as a `version_info` tuple or a `LooseVersion` instance, seems to address a real gap in the project's current version handling capabilities. The widespread use of `__version__` suggests that any solution should probably maintain or complement this existing mechanism rather than replace it. The absence of `LooseVersion` and the limited but present use of `version_info` suggest that introducing a standardized, easily comparable version information mechanism could indeed be a usability improvement for the project.\n\nThe next step would involve deciding between the proposed solutions (i.e., `LooseVersion` vs. `version_info` tuple) and implementing it in a way that integrates well with the existing uses of `__version__` across the project. Given the commonality of `version_info` in other projects and its existing, albeit limited, use in this project, leaning towards a `version_info` tuple might be the more straightforward and conventional choice."

        "content": "The additional search results provide more specific context regarding how version information is currently managed within the project, particularly in `lib/matplotlib/_version.py` and `setup.py`. Let's analyze these findings:\n\n1. **`lib/matplotlib/_version.py`**:\n   - This file defines `__version__` as a string (`'3.5.0.dev1324+gb7d0591986'`) and `__version_tuple__` as a tuple (`(3, 5, 0, 'dev1324', 'gb7d0591986')`). This indicates that the project already has a mechanism for representing the version both as a string and as a tuple, which can be more easily compared.\n   - The presence of `__version_tuple__` suggests that the project might already be partially addressing the issue's concern, albeit under a different name (`__version_tuple__` instead of `version_info`). This tuple format is indeed suitable for easy comparison of version numbers.\n\n2. **`setup.py`**:\n   - The usage of `sys.version_info` in `setup.py` is related to checking the Python version rather than handling the Matplotlib version. However, it demonstrates the practicality and commonality of using a version tuple (`version_info`) for version comparison within the Python ecosystem.\n   - The comparison `if sys.version_info < py_min_version:` is a clear example of how a tuple representation of version numbers can simplify compatibility checks.\n\n### Analysis Summary:\n- The project already employs a tuple representation of its version (`__version_tuple__`), which aligns with the proposed enhancement of adding a `version_info` tuple for easy version comparison. This could mean that the enhancement might only require making this existing tuple more accessible or officially documented under the proposed `version_info` name, rather than creating a new mechanism from scratch.\n- The absence of `LooseVersion` in the project and the issue's suggestion to possibly use it or a `version_info` tuple indicates a preference towards improving version comparability. Given the existing `__version_tuple__`, the project may benefit more from formalizing and documenting this approach rather than introducing `LooseVersion`, which would add a dependency or require additional implementation.\n- The use of version tuples for Python version checks in `setup.py` reinforces the utility and convention of using tuples for version comparison in the Python community.\n\nGiven this context, the path forward could involve formalizing the use of `__version_tuple__` as `version_info` (or simply documenting it as such if it's meant to serve this purpose), ensuring it's easily accessible for users needing to perform version comparisons. This approach leverages existing mechanisms within the project, aligning with common Python practices."
