Based on the context retrieved and the analysis provided, here is a proposed patch to add a `version_info` tuple for easy version comparison in the matplotlib project. This patch assumes the goal is to formalize and document the use of version information in a comparable format, leveraging the existing `__version_tuple__` structure.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
__version__ = version = '3.5.0.dev1324+gb7d0591986'
__version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (3, 5, 0, 'dev1324', 'gb7d0591986')
</original>
<patched>
__version__ = version = '3.5.0.dev1324+gb7d0591986'
__version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (3, 5, 0, 'dev1324', 'gb7d0591986')
# Adding version_info for easy version comparison
version_info = __version_tuple__
</patched>
```

This modification introduces `version_info` as an alias to `__version_tuple__`, making it more intuitive for users to perform version comparisons. The choice to alias rather than rename ensures backward compatibility with any existing references to `__version_tuple__` within the project.

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming there's a section where version information is imported or used
from . import _version
</original>
<patched>
# Import version_info for external use
from . import _version
from ._version import version_info
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that `version_info` is accessible from the top-level package, allowing users to easily import and use it for version comparisons.

# modification 3
```python
<file>doc/users/whats_new.rst</file>
<original>
.. note:: Add a section in the documentation about new features or changes.

Version Information for Comparison
-----------------------------------
Starting from version 3.5.0, Matplotlib introduces `version_info`, a tuple that makes it easier to compare versions within your code. You can use it as follows:

```python
import matplotlib
if matplotlib.version_info < (3, 6, 0):
    print("Consider upgrading Matplotlib to use new features.")
```
</patched>
```

This modification updates the documentation to inform users about the new `version_info` feature, providing an example of how it can be used for version comparison. This ensures that the enhancement is well-documented and that users are aware of how to leverage it for their needs.
