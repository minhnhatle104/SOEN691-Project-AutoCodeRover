      "response": "The issue description suggests that the problem arises because the code printer interprets `I` as the Python built-in complex number `1j` instead of an identity matrix. From the content of `lambdify.py`, we can see that the default namespace for NumPy (and SciPy) indeed maps `\"I\": 1j` (lines 25-26). This is likely where the misinterpretation stems from.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to modify the behavior of `lambdify` when dealing with identity matrices. Specifically, we should ensure that `I` is not automatically translated to `1j` in contexts where an identity matrix is expected. This might involve introducing a check or a special case for handling identity matrices differently from the built-in complex number `I`.\n\nBefore making any changes, let's further inspect the file to find the appropriate place to introduce this modification. We should look for the part of the code that handles the translation or interpretation of symbols, particularly focusing on how `I` is treated in the context of matrix operations.\n\nLet's scroll down to inspect more of the file to find a suitable place for this modification.\n\n```\nscroll_down\n```",

From the content of `lambdify.py`, we can see that the default namespace for NumPy (and SciPy) indeed maps `\"I\": 1j` (lines 25-26). This is likely where the misinterpretation stems from.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to modify the behavior of `lambdify` when dealing with identity matrices. Specifically, we should ensure that `I` is not automatically translated to `1j` in contexts where an identity matrix is expected. This might involve introducing a check or a special case for handling identity matrices differently from the built-in complex number `I`.\n\nBefore making any changes, let's further inspect the file to find the appropriate place to introduce this modification. We should look for the part of the code that handles the translation or interpretation of symbols, particularly focusing on how `I` is treated in the context of matrix operations.\n\nLet's scroll down to inspect more of the file to find a suitable place for this modification.\n\n"

The order and nesting of the\n222:    variables corresponds to the order and nesting of the parameters passed to\n223:    the lambdified function.

This is why lambdify\n498:    exists: to provide a bridge between SymPy and NumPy.**\n499:\n500:    However, why is it that ``f`` did work? That's because ``f`` doesn't call\n501:    any functions, it only adds 1. So the resulting function that is created,\n502:    ``def _lambdifygenerated(x): return x + 1`` does not depend on the globals\n503:    namespace it is defined in. Thus it works, but only by accident. A future\n504:    version of ``lambdify`` may remove this behavior.\n505:\n506:    Be aware that certain implementation details described here may change in\n507:    future versions of SymPy. The API of passing in custom modules and\n508:    printers will not change, but the details of how a lambda function is\n509:    created may change. However, the basic idea will remain the same, and\n510:    understanding it will be helpful to understanding the behavior of\n511:    lambdify.\n512:\n513:    **In general: you should create lambdified functions for one module (say,\n514:    NumPy), and only pass it input types that are compatible with that module\n515:    (say, NumPy arrays).** Remember that by default, if the ``module``\n516:    argument is not provided, ``lambdify`` creates functions using the NumPy\n517:    and SciPy namespaces.\n518:\n519:    Examples\n520:    ========\n521:\n522:    >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n523:    >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, Matrix\n524:    >>> from sympy import Function\n525:    >>> from sympy.abc import w, x, y, z\n526:\n527:    >>> f = lambdify(x, x**2)\n528:    >>> f(2)\n529:    4\n530:    >>> f = lambdify((x, y, z), [z, y, x])\n531:    >>> f(1,2,3)\n532:    [3, 2, 1]\n533:    >>> f = lambdify(x, sqrt(x))\n534:    >>> f(4)\n535:    2.0\n536:    >>> f = lambdify((x, y), sin(x*y)**2)\n537:    >>> f(0, 5)\n538:    0.0\n539:    >>> row = lambdify((x, y), Matrix((x, x + y)).T, modules='sympy')\n540:    >>> row(1, 2)\n541:    Matrix([[1, 3]])\n542:\n543:    ``lambdify`` can be used to translate SymPy expressions into mpmath\n544:    functions.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLambdify misinterprets some matrix expressions\nUsing lambdify on an expression containing an identity matrix gives us an unexpected result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> n = symbols('n', integer=True)\r\n>>> A = MatrixSymbol(\"A\", n, n)\r\n>>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\r\n>>> f = lambdify(A, A + Identity(n))\r\n>>> f(a)\r\narray([[1.+1.j, 2.+1.j],\r\n       [3.+1.j, 4.+1.j]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, the output should be  `array([[2, 2], [3, 5]])`, since we're adding an identity matrix to the array. Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import inspect\r\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\r\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\r\n    return (I + A)\r\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\r\n1j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

In general, SymPy functions do not work with objects from\n199:    other libraries, such as NumPy arrays, and functions from numeric\n200:    libraries like NumPy or mpmath do not work on SymPy expressions.\n201:    ``lambdify`` bridges the two by converting a SymPy expression to an\n202:    equivalent numeric function.\n203:\n204:    The basic workflow with ``lambdify`` is to first create a SymPy expression\n205:    representing whatever mathematical function you wish to evaluate. This\n206:    should be done using only SymPy functions and expressions. Then, use\n207:    ``lambdify`` to convert this to an equivalent function for numerical\n208:    evaluation. For instance, above we created ``expr`` using the SymPy symbol\n209:    ``x`` and SymPy functions ``sin`` and ``cos``, then converted it to an\n210:    equivalent NumPy function ``f``, and called it on a NumPy array ``a``.\n211:\n212:    .. warning::\n213:       This function uses ``exec``, and thus shouldn't be used on unsanitized\n214:       input.\n215:\n216:    Arguments\n217:    =========\n218:\n219:    The first argument of ``lambdify`` is a variable or list of variables in\n220:    the expression. Variable lists may be nested. Variables can be Symbols,\n221:    undefined functions, or matrix symbols. The order and nesting of the\n222:    variables corresponds to the order and nesting of the parameters passed to\n223:    the lambdified function. For instance,\n224:\n225:    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n226:    >>> f = lambdify([x, (y, z)], x + y + z)\n227:    >>> f(1, (2, 3))\n228:    6\n229:\n230:    The second argument of ``lambdify`` is the expression, list of\n231:    expressions, or matrix to be evaluated. Lists may be nested. If the\n232:    expression is a list, the output will also be a list.\n233:\n234:    >>> f = lambdify(x, [x, [x + 1, x + 2]])\n235:    >>> f(1)\n236:    [1, [2, 3]]\n237:\n238:    If it is a matrix, an array will be returned (for the NumPy module).\n239:\n240:    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n241:    >>> f = lambdify(x, Matrix([x, x + 1]))\n242:    >>> f(1)\n243:    [[1]\n244:     [2]]\n245:\n246:    Note that the argument order here, variables then expression, is used to\n247:    emulate the Python ``lambda`` keyword. ``lambdify(x, expr)`` works\n248:    (roughly) like ``lambda x: expr`` (see :ref:`lambdify-how-it-works` below).\n249:\n250:    The third argument, ``modules`` is optional. If not specified, ``modules``\n251:    defaults to ``[\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]`` if SciPy is installed, ``[\"numpy\"]`` if\n252:    only NumPy is installed, and ``[\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]`` if neither is\n253:    installed. That is, SymPy functions are replaced as far as possible by\n254:    either ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` functions if available, and Python's\n255:    standard library ``math``, or ``mpmath`` functions otherwise.\n256:\n257:    ``modules`` can be one of the following types\n258:\n259:     - the strings ``\"math\"``, ``\"mpmath\"``, ``\"numpy\"``, ``\"numexpr\"``,\n260:       ``\"scipy\"``, ``\"sympy\"``, or ``\"tensorflow\"``. This uses the\n261:       corresponding printer and namespace mapping for that module.\n262:     - a module (e.g., ``math``). This uses the global namespace of the\n263:       module. If the module is one of the above known modules, it will also\n264:       use the corresponding printer and namespace mapping (i.e.,\n265:       ``modules=numpy`` is equivalent to ``modules=\"numpy\"``).\n266:     - a dictionary that maps names of SymPy functions to arbitrary functions\n267:       (e.g., ``{'sin': custom_sin}``).\n268:     - a list that contains a mix of the arguments above, with higher priority\n269:       given to entries appearing first (e.g., to use the NumPy module but\n270:       override the ``sin`` function with a custom version, you can use\n271:       ``[{'sin': custom_sin}, 'numpy']``).\n272:\n273:    The ``dummify`` keyword argument controls whether or not the variables in\n274:    the provided expression that are not valid Python identifiers are\n275:    substituted with dummy symbols. This allows for undefined functions like\n276:    ``Function('f')(t)`` to be supplied as arguments. By default, the\n277:    variables are only dummified if they are not valid Python identifiers. Set\n278:    ``dummify=True`` to replace all arguments with dummy symbols (if ``args``\n279:    is not a string) - for example, to ensure that the arguments do not\n280:    redefine any built-in names.\n281:\n282:    .. _lambdify-how-it-works:\n283:\n284:    How it works\n285:    ============\n286:\n287:    When using this function, it helps a great deal to have an idea of what it\n288:    is doing.

In the second, they are defined as the NumPy versions.\n320:\n321:    If we were to import the first file and use the ``sin_cos`` function, we\n322:    would get something like\n323:\n324:    >>> from sin_cos_sympy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n325:    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n326:    cos(1) + sin(1)\n327:\n328:    On the other hand, if we imported ``sin_cos`` from the second file, we\n329:    would get\n330:\n331:    >>> from sin_cos_numpy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n332:    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n333:    1.38177329068\n334:\n335:    In the first case we got a symbolic output, because it used the symbolic\n336:    ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions from SymPy. In the second, we got a numeric\n337:    result, because ``sin_cos`` used the numeric ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions\n338:    from NumPy. But notice that the versions of ``sin`` and ``cos`` that were\n339:    used was not inherent to the ``sin_cos`` function definition. Both\n340:    ``sin_cos`` definitions are exactly the same. Rather, it was based on the\n341:    names defined at the module where the ``sin_cos`` function was defined.\n342:\n343:    The key point here is that when function in Python references a name that\n344:    is not defined in the function, that name is looked up in the \"global\"\n345:    namespace of the module where that function is defined.\n346:\n347:    Now, in Python, we can emulate this behavior without actually writing a\n348:    file to disk using the ``exec`` function. ``exec`` takes a string\n349:    containing a block of Python code, and a dictionary that should contain\n350:    the global variables of the module. It then executes the code \"in\" that\n351:    dictionary, as if it were the module globals. The following is equivalent\n352:    to the ``sin_cos`` defined in ``sin_cos_sympy.py``:\n353:\n354:    >>> import sympy\n355:    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': sympy.sin, 'cos': sympy.cos}\n356:    >>> exec('''\n357:    ... def sin_cos(x):\n358:    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n359:    ... ''', module_dictionary)\n360:    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n361:    >>> sin_cos(1)\n362:    cos(1) + sin(1)\n363:\n364:    and similarly with ``sin_cos_numpy``:\n365:\n366:    >>> import numpy\n367:    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': numpy.sin, 'cos': numpy.cos}\n368:    >>> exec('''\n369:    ... def sin_cos(x):\n370:    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n371:    ...

The name \"lambdify\"\n377:    comes from the fact that we can think of something like ``lambdify(x,\n378:    sin(x) + cos(x), 'numpy')`` as ``lambda x: sin(x) + cos(x)``, where\n379:    ``sin`` and ``cos`` come from the ``numpy`` namespace. This is also why\n380:    the symbols argument is first in ``lambdify``, as opposed to most SymPy\n381:    functions where it comes after the expression: to better mimic the\n382:    ``lambda`` keyword.\n383:\n384:    ``lambdify`` takes the input expression (like ``sin(x) + cos(x)``) and\n385:\n386:    1. Converts it to a string\n387:    2. Creates a module globals dictionary based on the modules that are\n388:       passed in (by default, it uses the NumPy module)\n389:    3.

So you can\n395:    see exactly how they are defined by using ``inspect.getsource``, or ``??`` if you\n396:    are using IPython or the Jupyter notebook.\n397:\n398:    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x) + cos(x))\n399:    >>> import inspect\n400:    >>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\n401:    def _lambdifygenerated(x):\n402:        return (sin(x) + cos(x))\n403:\n404:    This shows us the source code of the function, but not the namespace it\n405:    was defined in. We can inspect that by looking at the ``__globals__``\n406:    attribute of ``f``:\n407:\n408:    >>> f.__globals__['sin']\n409:    <ufunc 'sin'>\n410:    >>> f.__globals__['cos']\n411:    <ufunc 'cos'>\n412:    >>> f.__globals__['sin'] is numpy.sin\n413:    True\n414:\n415:    This shows us that ``sin`` and ``cos`` in the namespace of ``f`` will be\n416:    ``numpy.sin`` and ``numpy.cos``.\n417:\n418:    Note that there are some convenience layers in each of these steps, but at\n419:    the core, this is how ``lambdify`` works. Step 1 is done using the\n420:    ``LambdaPrinter`` printers defined in the printing module (see\n421:    :mod:`sympy.printing.lambdarepr`). This allows different SymPy expressions\n422:    to define how they should be converted to a string for different modules.\n423:    You can change which printer ``lambdify`` uses by passing a custom printer\n424:    in to the ``printer`` argument.\n425:\n426:    Step 2 is augmented by certain translations. There are default\n427:    translations for each module, but you can provide your own by passing a\n428:    list to the ``modules`` argument. For instance,\n429:\n430:    >>> def mysin(x):\n431:    ...     print('taking the sin of', x)\n432:    ...     return numpy.sin(x)\n433:    ...\n434:    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), [{'sin': mysin}, 'numpy'])\n435:    >>> f(1)\n436:    taking the sin of 1\n437:    0.8414709848078965\n438:\n439:    The globals dictionary is generated from the list by merging the\n440:    dictionary ``{'sin': mysin}`` and the module dictionary for NumPy. The\n441:    merging is done so that earlier items take precedence, which is why\n442:    ``mysin`` is used above instead of ``numpy.sin``.\n443:\n444:    If you want to modify the way ``lambdify`` works for a given function, it\n445:    is usually easiest to do so by modifying the globals dictionary as such.\n446:    In more complicated cases, it may be necessary to create and pass in a\n447:    custom printer.\n448:\n449:    Finally, step 3 is augmented with certain convenience operations, such as\n450:    the addition of a docstring.\n451:\n452:    Understanding how ``lambdify`` works can make it easier to avoid certain\n453:    gotchas when using it. For instance, a common mistake is to create a\n454:    lambdified function for one module (say, NumPy), and pass it objects from\n455:    another (say, a SymPy expression).\n456:\n457:    For instance, say we create\n458:\n459:    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n460:    >>> f = lambdify(x, x + 1, 'numpy')\n461:\n462:    Now if we pass in a NumPy array, we get that array plus 1\n463:\n464:    >>> import numpy\n465:    >>> a = numpy.array([1, 2])\n466:    >>> f(a)\n467:    [2 3]\n468:\n469:    But what happens if you make the mistake of passing in a SymPy expression\n470:    instead of a NumPy array:\n471:\n472:    >>> f(x + 1)\n473:    x + 2\n474:\n475:    This worked, but it was only by accident. Now take a different lambdified\n476:    function:\n477:\n478:    >>> from sympy import sin\n479:    >>> g = lambdify(x, x + sin(x), 'numpy')\n480:\n481:    This works as expected on NumPy arrays:\n482:\n483:    >>> g(a)\n484:    [1.84147098 2.90929743]\n485:\n486:    But if we try to pass in a SymPy expression, it fails\n487:\n488:    >>> g(x + 1)\n489:    Traceback (most recent call last):\n490:    ...\n491:    AttributeError: 'Add' object has no attribute 'sin'\n492:\n(755 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sympy__sympy/sympy/utilities/lambdify.py)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

The reason this fails is that ``g``\n494:    calls ``numpy.sin`` on the input expression, and ``numpy.sin`` does not\n495:    know how to operate on a SymPy object. **As a general rule, NumPy\n496:    functions do not know how to operate on SymPy expressions, and SymPy\n497:    functions do not know how to operate on NumPy arrays. This is why lambdify\n498:    exists: to provide a bridge between SymPy and NumPy.**\n499:\n500:    However, why is it that ``f`` did work? That's because ``f`` doesn't call\n501:    any functions, it only adds 1. So the resulting function that is created,\n502:    ``def _lambdifygenerated(x): return x + 1`` does not depend on the globals\n503:    namespace it is defined in. Thus it works, but only by accident. A future\n504:    version of ``lambdify`` may remove this behavior.\n505:\n506:    Be aware that certain implementation details described here may change in\n507:    future versions of SymPy. The API of passing in custom modules and\n508:    printers will not change, but the details of how a lambda function is\n509:    created may change. However, the basic idea will remain the same, and\n510:    understanding it will be helpful to understanding the behavior of\n511:    lambdify.\n512:\n513:    **In general: you should create lambdified functions for one module (say,\n514:    NumPy), and only pass it input types that are compatible with that module\n515:    (say, NumPy arrays).** Remember that by default, if the ``module``\n516:    argument is not provided, ``lambdify`` creates functions using the NumPy\n517:    and SciPy namespaces.\n518:\n519:    Examples\n520:    ========\n521:\n522:    >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n523:    >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, Matrix\n524:    >>> from sympy import Function\n525:    >>> from sympy.abc import w, x, y, z\n526:\n527:    >>> f = lambdify(x, x**2)\n528:    >>> f(2)\n529:    4\n530:    >>> f = lambdify((x, y, z), [z, y, x])\n531:    >>> f(1,2,3)\n532:    [3, 2, 1]\n533:    >>> f = lambdify(x, sqrt(x))\n534:    >>> f(4)\n535:    2.0\n536:    >>> f = lambdify((x, y), sin(x*y)**2)\n537:    >>> f(0, 5)\n538:    0.0\n539:    >>> row = lambdify((x, y), Matrix((x, x + y)).T, modules='sympy')\n540:    >>> row(1, 2)\n541:    Matrix([[1, 3]])\n542:\n543:    ``lambdify`` can be used to translate SymPy expressions into mpmath\n544:    functions.
