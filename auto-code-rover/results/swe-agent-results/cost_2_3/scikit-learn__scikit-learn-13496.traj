Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nExpose warm_start in Isolation forest\nIt seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.\r\n\r\nEven though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$",

Two important\n13:distinctions must be made:\n14:\n15::outlier detection:\n16:  The training data contains outliers which are defined as observations that\n17:  are far from the others. Outlier detection estimators thus try to fit the\n18:  regions where the training data is the most concentrated, ignoring the\n19:  deviant observations.\n20:\n21::novelty detection:\n22:  The training data is not polluted by outliers and we are interested in\n23:  detecting whether a **new** observation is an outlier. In this context an\n24:  outlier is also called a novelty.\n25:\n26:Outlier detection and novelty detection are both used for anomaly\n27:detection, where one is interested in detecting abnormal or unusual\n28:observations. Outlier detection is then also known as unsupervised anomaly\n29:detection and novelty detection as semi-supervised anomaly detection. In the\n30:context of outlier detection, the outliers/anomalies cannot form a\n31:dense cluster as available estimators assume that the outliers/anomalies are\n32:located in low density regions. On the contrary, in the context of novelty\n33:detection, novelties/anomalies can form a dense cluster as long as they are in\n34:a low density region of the training data, considered as normal in this\n35:context.\n36:\n37:The scikit-learn project provides a set of machine learning tools that\n38:can be used both for novelty or outlier detection. This strategy is\n39:implemented with objects learning in an unsupervised way from the data::\n40:\n41:    estimator.fit(X_train)\n42:\n43:new observations can then be sorted as inliers or outliers with a\n44:``predict`` method::\n45:\n46:    estimator.predict(X_test)\n47:\n48:Inliers are labeled 1, while outliers are labeled -1. The predict method\n49:makes use of a threshold on the raw scoring function computed by the\n50:estimator. This scoring function is accessible through the ``score_samples``\n51:method, while the threshold can be controlled by the ``contamination``\n52:parameter.\n53:\n54:The ``decision_function`` method is also defined from the scoring function,\n55:in such a way that negative values are outliers and non-negative ones are\n56:inliers::\n57:\n58:    estimator.decision_function(X_test)\n59:\n60:Note that :class:`neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` does not support\n61:``predict``, ``decision_function`` and ``score_samples`` methods by default\n62:but only a ``fit_predict`` method, as this estimator was originally meant to\n63:be applied for outlier detection.
