The ``toctree`` directive is the central element.\n31:\n32:.. note::\n33:\n34:   Simple \"inclusion\" of one file in another can be done with the\n35:   :dudir:`include` directive.\n36:\n37:.. note::\n38:\n39:   To create table of contents for current document (.rst file), use the\n40:   standard reST :dudir:`contents directive <table-of-contents>`.\n41:\n42:.. rst:directive:: toctree\n43:\n44:   This directive inserts a \"TOC tree\" at the current location, using the\n45:   individual TOCs (including \"sub-TOC trees\") of the documents given in the\n46:   directive body.  Relative document names (not beginning with a slash) are\n47:   relative to the document the directive occurs in, absolute names are relative\n48:   to the source directory.  A numeric ``maxdepth`` option may be given to\n49:   indicate the depth of the tree; by default, all levels are included.

Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nSphinx 3.2 complains about option:: syntax that earlier versions accepted\nSphinx 3.2 complains about use of the option:: directive that earlier versions accepted without complaint.\r\n\r\nThe QEMU documentation includes this:\r\n```\r\n.. option:: [enable=]PATTERN\r\n\r\n   Immediately enable events matching *PATTERN*\r\n```\r\n\r\nas part of the documentation of the command line options of one of its programs. Earlier versions of Sphinx were fine with this, but Sphinx 3.2 complains:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning, treated as error:\r\n../../docs/qemu-option-trace.rst.inc:4:Malformed option description '[enable=]PATTERN', should look like \"opt\", \"-opt args\", \"--opt args\", \"/opt args\" or \"+opt args\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSphinx ideally shouldn't change in ways that break the building of documentation that worked in older versions, because this makes it unworkably difficult to have documentation that builds with whatever the Linux distro's sphinx-build is.\r\n\r\nThe error message suggests that Sphinx has a very restrictive idea of what option syntax is; it would be better if it just accepted any string, because not all programs and OSes have option syntax that matches the limited list the error message indicates.\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-doc__sphinx)\nbash-$",

The ``toctree`` directive is the central element.\n31:\n32:.. note::\n33:\n34:   Simple \"inclusion\" of one file in another can be done with the\n35:   :dudir:`include` directive.\n36:\n37:.. note::\n38:\n39:   To create table of contents for current document (.rst file), use the\n40:   standard reST :dudir:`contents directive <table-of-contents>`.\n41:\n42:.. rst:directive:: toctree\n43:\n44:   This directive inserts a \"TOC tree\" at the current location, using the\n45:   individual TOCs (including \"sub-TOC trees\") of the documents given in the\n46:   directive body.  Relative document names (not beginning with a slash) are\n47:   relative to the document the directive occurs in, absolute names are relative\n48:   to the source directory.  A numeric ``maxdepth`` option may be given to\n49:   indicate the depth of the tree; by default, all levels are included. [#]_\n50:\n51:   The representation of \"TOC tree\" is changed in each output format.  The\n52:   builders that output multiple files (ex. HTML) treat it as a collection of\n53:   hyperlinks.  On the other hand, the builders that output a single file (ex.\n54:   LaTeX, man page, etc.) replace it with the content of the documents on the\n55:   TOC tree.\n56:\n57:   Consider this example (taken from the Python docs' library reference index)::\n58:\n59:      .. toctree::\n60:         :maxdepth: 2\n61:\n62:         intro\n63:         strings\n64:         datatypes\n65:         numeric\n66:         (many more documents listed here)\n67:\n68:   This accomplishes two things:\n69:\n70:   * Tables of contents from all those documents are inserted, with a maximum\n71:     depth of two, that means one nested heading.  ``toctree`` directives in\n72:     those documents are also taken into account.\n73:   * Sphinx knows the relative order of the documents ``intro``,\n74:     ``strings`` and so forth, and it knows that they are children of the shown\n75:     document, the library index.  From this information it generates \"next\n76:     chapter\", \"previous chapter\" and \"parent chapter\" links.\n77:\n78:   **Entries**\n79:\n80:   Document titles in the :rst:dir:`toctree` will be automatically read from the\n81:   title of the referenced document. If that isn't what you want, you can\n82:   specify an explicit title and target using a similar syntax to reST\n83:   hyperlinks (and Sphinx's :ref:`cross-referencing syntax <xref-syntax>`).
