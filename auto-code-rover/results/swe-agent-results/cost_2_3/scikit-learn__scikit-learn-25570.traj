It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error. If you remove .set_output(transform=\"pandas\") on the line before last, all works fine. If you remove the (\"categorical\", ...) step, it works fine too.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.compose import

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$",

      "content": "The issue describes a problem where transformers that apply to 0 features are not fitted properly when using \"pandas\" as the output. This leads to a mismatch in expected and actual column names, causing an error. The relevant code sections are around lines 856 and 859, where the feature names are handled.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to ensure that transformers with no features (i.e., those that should be ignored) are handled correctly in the `_hstack` method, specifically when setting the output columns. A potential solution could involve modifying the logic to correctly handle cases where a transformer applies to 0 features, ensuring they are either fitted correctly or excluded from the output feature names as appropriate.\n\nBefore making any changes, it's crucial to understand the current logic in lines 856 to 873. The code attempts to concatenate the outputs from different transformers and then set the column names based on the transformers' feature names. However, it seems to fail when a transformer with no features is included, as it doesn't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` and thus breaks the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function.\n\nA possible fix could involve adjusting the logic in the `_iter` method or directly in the section that handles the output columns to ensure that transformers with no features are either correctly processed or their absence is accounted for when setting the output column names.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, it's essential to carefully plan the changes and test them thoroughly to avoid introducing new bugs. Let's start by adding a check to ignore transformers with no features when setting the output column names.\n\nI will now proceed to make an edit to include a check for transformers with no features in the relevant section of the code.\n\n```\nedit 856:873\n                if not self.verbose_feature_names_out:\n                    return output\n\n                transformer_names = [\n                    t[0] for t in self._iter(fitted=True, replace_strings=True)\n                ]\n                feature_names_outs = [X.columns for X in Xs if X.shape[1] > 0]  # Modified line to exclude transformers with no features\n                names_out = self._add_prefix_for_feature_names_out(\n                    list(zip(transformer_names, feature_names_outs))\n                )\n                output.columns = names_out\n                return output\nend_of_edit\n```",
      "thought": "The issue describes a problem where transformers that apply to 0 features are not fitted properly when using \"pandas\" as the output. This leads to a mismatch in expected and actual column names, causing an error. The relevant code sections are around lines 856 and 859, where the feature names are handled.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to ensure that transformers with no features (i.e., those that should be ignored) are handled correctly in the `_hstack` method, specifically when setting the output columns. A potential solution could involve modifying the logic to correctly handle cases where a transformer applies to 0 features, ensuring they are either fitted correctly or excluded from the output feature names as appropriate.\n\nBefore making any changes, it's crucial to understand the current logic in lines 856 to 873.
