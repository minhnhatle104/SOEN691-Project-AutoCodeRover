      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nv3.3 upgrade started generating \"WARNING: no number is assigned for table\" warnings\nWe've updated to Sphinx 3.3 in our documentation, and suddenly the following warning started popping up in our builds when we build either `singlehtml` or `latex`.:\r\n\r\n`WARNING: no number is assigned for table:`\r\n\r\nI looked through the changelog but it didn't seem like there was anything related to `numref` that was changed, but perhaps I missed something? Could anyone point me to a change in the numref logic so I can figure out where these warnings are coming from?\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-doc__sphinx)\nbash-$",

While Docutils provides a number of directives, Sphinx\n9:provides many more and uses directives as one of the primary extension\n10:mechanisms.\n11:\n12:See :doc:`/usage/restructuredtext/domains` for roles added by domains.\n13:\n14:.. seealso::\n15:\n16:   Refer to the :ref:`reStructuredText Primer <rst-directives>` for an overview\n17:   of the directives provided by Docutils.\n18:\n19:\n20:.. _toctree-directive:\n21:\n22:Table of contents\n23:-----------------\n24:\n25:.. index:: pair: table of; contents\n26:\n27:Since reST does not have facilities to interconnect several documents, or split\n28:documents into multiple output files, Sphinx uses a custom directive to add\n29:relations between the single files the documentation is made of, as well as\n30:tables of contents.  The ``toctree`` directive is the central element.\n31:\n32:.. note::\n33:\n34:   Simple \"inclusion\" of one file in another can be done with the\n35:   :dudir:`include` directive.\n36:\n37:.. note::\n38:\n39:   To create table of contents for current document (.rst file), use the\n40:   standard reST :dudir:`contents directive <table-of-contents>`.\n41:\n42:.. rst:directive:: toctree\n43:\n44:   This directive inserts a \"TOC tree\" at the current location, using the\n45:   individual TOCs (including \"sub-TOC trees\") of the documents given in the\n46:   directive body.  Relative document names (not beginning with a slash) are\n47:   relative to the document the directive occurs in, absolute names are relative\n48:   to the source directory.  A numeric ``maxdepth`` option may be given to\n49:   indicate the depth of the tree; by default, all levels are included. [#]_\n50:\n51:   The representation of \"TOC tree\" is changed in each output format.  The\n52:   builders that output multiple files (ex. HTML) treat it as a collection of\n53:   hyperlinks.  On the other hand, the builders that output a single file (ex.\n54:   LaTeX, man page, etc.) replace it with the content of the documents on the\n55:   TOC tree.\n56:\n57:   Consider this example (taken from the Python docs' library reference index)::\n58:\n59:      .. toctree::\n60:         :maxdepth: 2\n61:\n62:         intro\n63:         strings\n64:         datatypes\n65:         numeric\n66:         (many more documents listed here)\n67:\n68:   This accomplishes two things:\n69:\n70:   * Tables of contents from all those documents are inserted, with a maximum\n71:     depth of two, that means one nested heading.  ``toctree`` directives in\n72:     those documents are also taken into account.\n73:   * Sphinx knows the relative order of the documents ``intro``,\n74:     ``strings`` and so forth, and it knows that they are children of the shown\n75:     document, the library index.  From this information it generates \"next\n76:     chapter\", \"previous chapter\" and \"parent chapter\" links.\n77:\n78:   **Entries**\n79:\n80:   Document titles in the :rst:dir:`toctree` will be automatically read from the\n81:   title of the referenced document. If that isn't what you want, you can\n82:   specify an explicit title and target using a similar syntax to reST\n83:   hyperlinks (and Sphinx's :ref:`cross-referencing syntax <xref-syntax>`). This\n84:   looks like::\n85:\n86:       .. toctree::\n87:\n88:          intro\n89:          All about strings <strings>\n90:          datatypes\n91:\n92:   The second line above will link to the ``strings`` document, but will use the\n93:   title \"All about strings\" instead of the title of the ``strings`` document.\n94:\n95:   You can also add external links, by giving an HTTP URL instead of a document\n96:   name.\n97:\n98:   **Section numbering**\n99:\n100:   If you want to have section numbers even in HTML output, give the\n(1155 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sphinx-doc__sphinx/doc/usage/restructuredtext/directives.rst)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-doc__sphinx)\nbash-$",
