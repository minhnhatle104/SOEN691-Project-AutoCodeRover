Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nQueryset raises NotSupportedError when RHS has filterable=False attribute.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Nicolas Baccelli)\n\t \nI'm migrating my app to django 3.0.7 and I hit a strange behavior using a model class with a field labeled filterable\nclass ProductMetaDataType(models.Model):\n\tlabel = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True, blank=False, null=False)\n\tfilterable = models.BooleanField(default=False, verbose_name=_(\"filterable\"))\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tapp_label = \"adminpricing\"\n\t\tverbose_name = _(\"product meta data type\")\n\t\tverbose_name_plural = _(\"product meta data types\")\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.label\nclass ProductMetaData(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tProduit, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE\n\t)\n\tvalue = models.TextField(null=False, blank=False)\n\tmarketplace = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tPlateforme, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE\n\t)\n\tdate_created = models.DateTimeField(null=True, default=timezone.now)\n\tmetadata_type = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tProductMetaDataType, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE\n\t)\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tapp_label = \"adminpricing\"\n\t\tverbose_name = _(\"product meta data\")\n\t\tverbose_name_plural = _(\"product meta datas\")\nError happened when filtering ProductMetaData with a metadata_type :\nProductMetaData.objects.filter(value=\"Dark Vador\", metadata_type=self.brand_metadata)\nError traceback :\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/backoffice/backoffice/adminpricing/tests/test_pw.py\", line 481, in test_checkpolicywarning_by_fields\n\tfor p in ProductMetaData.objects.filter(\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/manager.py\", line 82, in manager_method\n\treturn getattr(self.get_queryset(), name)(*args, **kwargs)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 904, in filter\n\treturn self._filter_or_exclude(False, *args, **kwargs)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 923, in _filter_or_exclude\n\tclone.query.add_q(Q(*args, **kwargs))\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1351, in add_q\n\tclause, _ = self._add_q(q_object, self.used_aliases)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1378, in _add_q\n\tchild_clause, needed_inner = self.build_filter(\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1264, in build_filter\n\tself.check_filterable(value)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1131, in check_filterable\n\traise NotSupportedError(\ndjango.db.utils.NotSupportedError: ProductMetaDataType is disallowed in the filter clause.\nI changed label to filterable_test and it fixed this issue\nThis should be documented or fix.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$",

Each field is\n35:specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a database column.\n36:\n37:The above ``Person`` model would create a database table like this:\n38:\n39:.. code-block:: sql\n40:\n41:    CREATE TABLE myapp_person (\n42:        \"id\" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n43:        \"first_name\" varchar(30) NOT NULL,\n44:        \"last_name\" varchar(30) NOT NULL\n45:    );\n46:\n47:Some technical notes:\n48:\n49:* The name of the table, ``myapp_person``, is automatically derived from\n50:  some model metadata but can be overridden. See :ref:`table-names` for more\n51:  details.\n52:\n53:* An ``id`` field is added automatically, but this behavior can be\n54:  overridden. See :ref:`automatic-primary-key-fields`.\n55:\n56:* The ``CREATE TABLE`` SQL in this example is formatted using PostgreSQL\n57:  syntax, but it's worth noting Django uses SQL tailored to the database\n58:  backend specified in your :doc:`settings file </topics/settings>`.\n59:\n60:Using models\n61:============\n62:\n63:Once you have defined your models, you need to tell Django you're going to *use*\n64:those models. Do this by editing your settings file and changing the\n65::setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting to add the name of the module that contains\n66:your ``models.py``.\n67:\n68:For example, if the models for your application live in the module\n69:``myapp.models`` (the package structure that is created for an\n70:application by the :djadmin:`manage.py startapp <startapp>` script),\n71::setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` should read, in part::\n72:\n73:    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n74:        #...\n75:        'myapp',\n76:        #...\n77:    ]\n78:\n79:When you add new apps to :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, be sure to run\n80::djadmin:`manage.py migrate <migrate>`, optionally making migrations\n81:for them first with :djadmin:`manage.py makemigrations <makemigrations>`.\n82:\n83:Fields\n84:======\n85:\n86:The most important part of a model -- and the only required part of a model --\n87:is the list of database fields it defines. Fields are specified by class\n88:attributes. Be careful not to choose field names that conflict with the\n89::doc:`models API </ref/models/instances>` like ``clean``, ``save``, or\n90:``delete``.\n91:\n92:Example::\n93:\n94:    from django.db import models\n95:\n96:    class Musician(models.Model):\n97:        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n98:        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n99:        instrument = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n100:\n(1379 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /django__django/docs/topics/db/models.txt)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$",

You can easily write\n125:your own fields if Django's built-in ones don't do the trick; see\n126::doc:`/howto/custom-model-fields`.\n127:\n128:Field options\n129:-------------\n130:\n131:Each field takes a certain set of field-specific arguments (documented in the\n132::ref:`model field reference <model-field-types>`). For example,\n133::class:`~django.db.models.CharField` (and its subclasses) require a\n134::attr:`~django.db.models.CharField.max_length` argument which specifies the size\n135:of the ``VARCHAR`` database field used to store the data.\n136:\n137:There's also a set of common arguments available to all field types. All are\n138:optional. They're fully explained in the :ref:`reference\n139:<common-model-field-options>`, but here's a quick summary of the most often-used\n140:ones:\n(1339 more lines below)\nFile updated.
