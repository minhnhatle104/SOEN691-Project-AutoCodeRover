      "response": "The `concat` function in `/pydata__xarray/xarray/core/concat.py` is where we need to make modifications to address the issue. The issue requests an enhancement to allow for the concatenation of datasets with different variables without needing to create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables entirely. \n\nFrom the parameters of the `concat` function, it looks like `data_vars` and `coords` control how data variables and coordinate variables are treated during concatenation. However, to directly address the issue, we might need to introduce a new parameter or modify the behavior of existing parameters to allow for the automatic handling of missing variables.\n\nA potential solution could involve modifying how the `data_vars` parameter works or introducing a new parameter that specifies the behavior when encountering variables that are not present in all datasets being concatenated. This could involve automatically filling missing variables with `NaN` values without requiring the user to manually create dummy variables.\n\nBefore making any changes, let's plan out the modification. We could introduce a new parameter, say `handle_missing_vars`, with options such as `'fill'` (to fill missing variables with `NaN`) and `'ignore'` (to ignore missing variables and proceed with concatenation). The default behavior could remain as it is currently, requiring explicit handling of missing variables by the user, to maintain backward compatibility.\n\nGiven the complexity of the change and the need to ensure it doesn't introduce regressions or unexpected behavior, it would also be necessary to update or add unit tests corresponding to this new functionality.\n\nFor now, let's start by adding a new parameter `handle_missing_vars` to the `concat` function signature with a default value that preserves the current behavior.

However, to directly address the issue, we might need to introduce a new parameter or modify the behavior of existing parameters to allow for the automatic handling of missing variables.\n\nA potential solution could involve modifying how the `data_vars` parameter works or introducing a new parameter that specifies the behavior when encountering variables that are not present in all datasets being concatenated. This could involve automatically filling missing variables with `NaN` values without requiring the user to manually create dummy variables.\n\nBefore making any changes, let's plan out the modification. We could introduce a new parameter, say `handle_missing_vars`, with options such as `'fill'` (to fill missing variables with `NaN`) and `'ignore'` (to ignore missing variables and proceed with concatenation). The default behavior could remain as it is currently, requiring explicit handling of missing variables by the user, to maintain backward compatibility.\n\nGiven the complexity of the change and the need to ensure it doesn't introduce regressions or unexpected behavior, it would also be necessary to update or add unit tests corresponding to this new functionality.\n\nFor now, let's start by adding a new parameter `handle_missing_vars` to the `concat` function signature with a default value that preserves the current behavior. We'll then modify the function's logic to implement the handling of missing variables based on this parameter.\n\nLet's begin by editing the function signature to include the new parameter.\n\n"

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nIgnore missing variables when concatenating datasets?\nSeveral users (@raj-kesavan, @richardotis, now myself) have wondered about how to concatenate xray Datasets with different variables.\n\nWith the current `xray.concat`, you need to awkwardly create dummy variables filled with `NaN` in datasets that don't have them (or drop mismatched variables entirely). Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pydata__xarray)\nbash-$",
