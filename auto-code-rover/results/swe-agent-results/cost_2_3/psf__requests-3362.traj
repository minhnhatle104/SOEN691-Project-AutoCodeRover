Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nUncertain about content/text vs iter_content(decode_unicode=True/False)\nWhen requesting an application/json document, I'm seeing `next(r.iter_content(16*1024, decode_unicode=True))` returning bytes, whereas `r.text` returns unicode. My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\n\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /psf__requests)\nbash-$",

      "content": "The implementation of `stream_decode_response_unicode` starts at line 359 in `requests/utils.py`. This function is designed to decode a stream of bytes into unicode characters, given an iterator over the byte chunks and a response object `r` which contains the encoding information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function's logic:\n- If `r.encoding` is `None`, it yields the items from the iterator as they are, without attempting to decode them (lines 362-365).\n- If `r.encoding` is not `None`, it creates a decoder using the specified encoding and iterates over the chunks, decoding each one and yielding the result (lines 367-374).\n\nThe key part of the function that handles the decoding is:\n```python\ndecoder = codecs.getincrementaldecoder(r.encoding)(errors='replace')\nfor chunk in iterator:\n    rv = decoder.decode(chunk)\n    if rv:\n        yield rv\nrv = decoder.decode(b'', final=True)\nif rv:\n    yield rv\n```\n\nThis implementation seems correct in terms of attempting to decode the content based on the specified encoding. However, the issue reported suggests that despite `decode_unicode=True`, the `iter_content` method is returning bytes instead of decoded unicode strings.\n\nGiven the correct implementation of `stream_decode_response_unicode`, the issue might not lie within this function itself but possibly in how the encoding is determined or set in the response object `r`.

      "thought": "The implementation of `stream_decode_response_unicode` starts at line 359 in `requests/utils.py`. This function is designed to decode a stream of bytes into unicode characters, given an iterator over the byte chunks and a response object `r` which contains the encoding information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function's logic:\n- If `r.encoding` is `None`, it yields the items from the iterator as they are, without attempting to decode them (lines 362-365).\n- If `r.encoding` is not `None`, it creates a decoder using the specified encoding and iterates over the chunks, decoding each one and yielding the result (lines 367-374).\n\nThe key part of the function that handles the decoding is:\nThis implementation seems correct in terms of attempting to decode the content based on the specified encoding. However, the issue reported suggests that despite `decode_unicode=True`, the `iter_content` method is returning bytes instead of decoded unicode strings.\n\nGiven the correct implementation of `stream_decode_response_unicode`, the issue might not lie within this function itself but possibly in how the encoding is determined or set in the response object `r`. If `r.encoding` is not correctly determined or set to `None`, the function would default to yielding byte chunks without decoding them, as seen in lines 362-365.\n\nTo further investigate, we should ensure that the response object `r` has the correct encoding set when `decode_unicode=True` is passed to `iter_content`.
