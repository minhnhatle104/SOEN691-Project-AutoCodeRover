Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nColumnTransformer with pandas output can't handle transformers with no features\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nColumnTransformer doesn't deal well with transformers that apply to 0 features (categorical_features in the example below) when using \"pandas\" as output. It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error.

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$",

This involves adjusting the conditions around lines 394-395, where it checks for empty column selections, to ensure these transformers are included in the output feature names generation process.\n   - Ensure that the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function can handle cases where transformers with no features are included, preventing the length mismatch error.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Review the `_iter` method and identify the exact conditions that lead to transformers with no features being excluded from the fitted transformers list.\n   - Adjust the logic within `_iter` to include transformers with no features in the iteration process when generating output feature names for pandas output.\n   - Test the modified `_iter` method to ensure that it correctly includes transformers with no features in the output feature names list.\n   - Review and possibly adjust the implementation of `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` to ensure it handles the inclusion of transformers with no features appropriately.\n   - Add unit tests to cover the scenario where a `ColumnTransformer` with pandas output includes transformers with no features, ensuring that the expected behavior is achieved without errors.\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Create a test case that replicates the issue using a `ColumnTransformer` with pandas output and a transformer that applies to 0 features.\n   - Verify that the modified implementation resolves the issue by ensuring that the test case runs without resulting in a length mismatch error.\n   - Run the full scikit-learn test suite to ensure that the changes do not introduce any regressions.\n\n5. **Documentation**:\n   - Update the documentation for `ColumnTransformer` to include information about handling transformers with no features when using pandas output.\n   - Include examples that demonstrate the correct usage and expected behavior in such scenarios.\n\nThis plan aims to resolve the issue while maintaining the integrity and functionality of the `ColumnTransformer` class.
