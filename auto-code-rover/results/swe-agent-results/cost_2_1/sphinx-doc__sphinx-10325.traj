Given the current information, it seems we should explore other components of the autodoc extension for the specific logic related to inherited members.\n\nLet's go back to the directory listing to choose another file that could contain the implementation details we're looking for.\n\n"

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\ninherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-doc__sphinx)\nbash-$",

This function seems to handle options in a generic way, which might not directly address how to modify the `:inherited-members:` option to accept a list of classes. However, it does provide insight into how options are generally handled within the autodoc extension.\n\nGiven that the specific handling of the `:inherited-members:` option to accept a list of classes might require modifications in how options are parsed and applied to documenters, and considering that this file (`directive.py`) primarily deals with directive processing rather than the detailed handling of each autodoc option, it's possible that the actual implementation of the `:inherited-members:` logic is elsewhere.\n\nThe modification required for the feature request likely involves:\n1. Extending the parsing capabilities to allow `:inherited-members:` to accept a list of classes.\n2. Modifying the logic that applies the `:inherited-members:` option to documenters, so it can correctly interpret and act upon a list of classes rather than a simple boolean.\n\nSince the direct approach within this file did not reveal the specific implementation details for handling `:inherited-members:`, it might be beneficial to look into other files within the `autodoc` extension that could be responsible for the actual documentation generation process, where the handling of inherited members would be applied.\n\nBefore proceeding to search other files, it's important to consider if there's any other part of this file that might give us more clues. Given the current information, it seems we should explore other components of the autodoc extension for the specific logic related to inherited members.\n\nLet's go back to the directory listing to choose another file that could contain the implementation details we're looking for.\n\n```\nls ./sphinx/ext/autodoc\n```",

However, it does provide insight into how options are generally handled within the autodoc extension.\n\nGiven that the specific handling of the `:inherited-members:` option to accept a list of classes might require modifications in how options are parsed and applied to documenters, and considering that this file (`directive.py`) primarily deals with directive processing rather than the detailed handling of each autodoc option, it's possible that the actual implementation of the `:inherited-members:` logic is elsewhere.\n\nThe modification required for the feature request likely involves:\n1. Extending the parsing capabilities to allow `:inherited-members:` to accept a list of classes.\n2. Modifying the logic that applies the `:inherited-members:` option to documenters, so it can correctly interpret and act upon a list of classes rather than a simple boolean.\n\nSince the direct approach within this file did not reveal the specific implementation details for handling `:inherited-members:`, it might be beneficial to look into other files within the `autodoc` extension that could be responsible for the actual documentation generation process, where the handling of inherited members would be applied.\n\nBefore proceeding to search other files, it's important to consider if there's any other part of this file that might give us more clues. Given the current information, it seems we should explore other components of the autodoc extension for the specific logic related to inherited members.\n\nLet's go back to the directory listing to choose another file that could contain the implementation details we're looking for.\n\n",
