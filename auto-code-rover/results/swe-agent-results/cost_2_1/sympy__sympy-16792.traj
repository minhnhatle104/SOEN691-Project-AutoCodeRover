This code generator can be extended to support\n15:  .pyf files for f2py.\n16:\n17:- SymPy functions are not concerned with programming-technical issues, such\n18:  as input, output and input-output arguments. Other examples are contiguous\n19:  or non-contiguous arrays, including headers of other libraries such as gsl\n20:  or others.\n21:\n22:- It is highly interesting to evaluate several sympy functions in one C\n23:  routine, eventually sharing common intermediate results with the help\n24:  of the cse routine. This is more than just printing.\n25:\n26:- From the programming perspective, expressions with constants should be\n27:  evaluated in the code generator as much as possible. This is different\n28:  for printing.\n29:\n30:--- Basic assumptions ---\n31:\n32:* A generic Routine data structure describes the routine that must be\n33:  translated into C/Fortran/... code. This data structure covers all\n34:  features present in one or more of the supported languages.\n35:\n36:* Descendants from the CodeGen class transform multiple Routine instances\n37:  into compilable code. Each derived class translates into a specific\n38:  language.\n39:\n40:* In many cases, one wants a simple workflow. The friendly functions in the\n41:  last part are a simple api on top of the Routine/CodeGen stuff. They are\n42:  easier to use, but are less powerful.\n43:\n44:--- Milestones ---\n45:\n46:+ First working version with scalar input arguments, generating C code,\n47:  tests\n48:+ Friendly functions that are easier to use than the rigorous\n49:  Routine/CodeGen workflow.\n50:+ Integer and Real numbers as input and output\n51:+ Output arguments\n52:+ InputOutput arguments\n53:+ Sort input/output arguments properly\n54:+ Contiguous array arguments (numpy matrices)\n55:+ Also generate .pyf code for f2py (in autowrap module)\n56:+ Isolate constants and evaluate them beforehand in double precision\n57:+ Fortran 90\n58:+ Octave/Matlab\n59:\n60:- Common Subexpression Elimination\n61:- User defined comments in the generated code\n62:- Optional extra include lines for libraries/objects that can eval special\n63:  functions\n64:- Test other C compilers and libraries: gcc, tcc, libtcc, gcc+gsl, ...\n65:- Contiguous array arguments (sympy matrices)\n66:- Non-contiguous array arguments (sympy matrices)\n67:- ccode must raise an error when it encounters something that can not be\n68:  translated into c. ccode(integrate(sin(x)/x, x)) does not make sense.\n69:- Complex numbers as input and output\n70:- A default complex datatype\n71:- Include extra information in the header: date, user, hostname, sha1\n72:  hash, ...\n73:- Fortran 77\n74:- C++\n75:- Python\n76:- Julia\n77:- Rust\n78:- ...\n79:\n80:\"\"\"\n81:\n82:from __future__ import print_function, division\n83:\n84:import os\n85:import textwrap\n86:\n87:from sympy import __version__ as sympy_version\n88:from sympy.core import Symbol, S, Tuple, Equality, Function, Basic\n89:from sympy.core.compatibility import is_sequence, StringIO, string_types\n90:from sympy.printing.ccode import c_code_printers\n91:from sympy.printing.codeprinter import AssignmentError\n92:from sympy.printing.fcode import FCodePrinter\n93:from sympy.printing.julia import JuliaCodePrinter\n94:from sympy.printing.octave import OctaveCodePrinter\n95:from sympy.printing.rust import RustCodePrinter\n96:from sympy.tensor import Idx, Indexed, IndexedBase\n97:from sympy.matrices import (MatrixSymbol, ImmutableMatrix, MatrixBase,\n98:                            MatrixExpr, MatrixSlice)\n99:\n100:\n(2132 more lines below)\n",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nautowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",
