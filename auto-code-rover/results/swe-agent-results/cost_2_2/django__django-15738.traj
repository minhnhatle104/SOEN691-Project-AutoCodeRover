Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nModels migration with change field foreign to many and deleting unique together.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nI have models like\nclass Authors(models.Model):\n\tproject_data_set = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tProjectDataSet,\n\t\ton_delete=models.PROTECT\n\t)\n\tstate = models.IntegerField()\n\tstart_date = models.DateField()\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\t unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)\nand\nclass DataSet(models.Model):\n\tname = models.TextField(max_length=50)\nclass Project(models.Model):\n\tdata_sets = models.ManyToManyField(\n\t\tDataSet,\n\t\tthrough='ProjectDataSet',\n\t)\n\tname = models.TextField(max_length=50)\nclass ProjectDataSet(models.Model):\n\t\"\"\"\n\tCross table of data set and project\n\t\"\"\"\n\tdata_set = models.ForeignKey(DataSet, on_delete=models.PROTECT)\n\tproject = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.PROTECT)\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tunique_together = (('data_set', 'project'),)\nwhen i want to change field project_data_set in Authors model from foreign key field to many to many field I must delete a unique_together, cause it can't be on many to many field.\nThen my model should be like:\nclass Authors(models.Model):\n\tproject_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(\n\t\tProjectDataSet,\n\t)\n\tstate = models.IntegerField()\n\tstart_date = models.DateField()\nBut when I want to do a migrations.\npython3 manage.py makemigrations\npython3 manage.py migrate\nI have error:\nValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)\nThe database is on production, so I can't delete previous initial migrations, and this error isn't depending on database, cause I delete it and error is still the same.\nMy solve is to first delete unique_together, then do a makemigrations and then migrate. After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.\nBut in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.\nI added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$",

This suggests that we're not looking at the right file for addressing the issue at hand.\n\nGiven the size of the project and the specific nature of the issue, it's clear that a more targeted approach is needed to find the relevant models and make the necessary changes. Since our initial attempts to locate the models directly have not been successful, and considering the broad scope of the project, it might be beneficial to re-evaluate our strategy.\n\nOne possible next step could be to inspect the `tests/prefetch_related/models.py` file, as it was another candidate identified earlier that could potentially contain relevant model definitions or references.
