The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n10:docstrings for examples.\n11:\n12:    TR0 - simplify expression\n13:    TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n14:    TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n15:    TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n16:    TR3 - angle canonicalization\n17:    TR4 - functions at special angles\n18:    TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n19:    TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n20:    TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n21:    TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n22:    TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n23:    TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n24:    TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n25:    TR11 - reduce double angles\n26:    TR12 - separate tan arguments\n27:    TR12i - collect tan arguments\n28:    TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n29:    TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n30:    TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n31:    TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n32:    TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n33:    TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n34:    TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n35:\n36:There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n37:transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n38:a few options.\n39:\n40:Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n41:sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n42:algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n43:best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n44:of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n45:\n46:Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n47:e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n48:``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n49:traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n50:attempted. For example,\n51:\n52:    Set-up for examples below:\n53:\n54:    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n55:    >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n56:    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n57:    >>> from time import time\n58:\n59:>>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n60:>>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n61:-sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n62:\n63:If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n64:the transformation is successful:\n65:\n66:>>> TR10i(_.normal())\n67:cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n68:\n69:TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n70:doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n71:\n72:>>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n73:(2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n74:>>> powsimp(_)\n75:(2*sin(1))**a\n76:\n77:The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n78:be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n79:well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n80:recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n81:\n82:>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n83:a*cos(x - y)\n84:\n85:Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n86:until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n87:help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n88:``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n89:(but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n90:\n91:>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n92:a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n93:\n94:In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n95:to make that decision. For example:\n96:\n97:>>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n98:... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n99:... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n100:... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n(2115 more lines below)\n",

Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n10:docstrings for examples.\n11:\n12:    TR0 - simplify expression\n13:    TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n14:    TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n15:    TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n16:    TR3 - angle canonicalization\n17:    TR4 - functions at special angles\n18:    TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n19:    TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n20:    TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n21:    TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n22:    TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n23:    TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n24:    TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n25:    TR11 - reduce double angles\n26:    TR12 - separate tan arguments\n27:    TR12i - collect tan arguments\n28:    TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n29:    TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n30:    TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n31:    TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n32:    TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n33:    TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n34:    TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n35:\n36:There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n37:transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n38:a few options.\n39:\n40:Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n41:sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n42:algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n43:best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n44:of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n45:\n46:Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n47:e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n48:``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n49:traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n50:attempted. For example,\n51:\n52:    Set-up for examples below:\n53:\n54:    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n55:    >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n56:    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n57:    >>> from time import time\n58:\n59:>>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n60:>>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n61:-sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n62:\n63:If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n64:the transformation is successful:\n65:\n66:>>> TR10i(_.normal())\n67:cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n68:\n69:TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n70:doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n71:\n72:>>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n73:(2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n74:>>> powsimp(_)\n75:(2*sin(1))**a\n76:\n77:The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n78:be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n79:well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n80:recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n81:\n82:>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n83:a*cos(x - y)\n84:\n85:Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n86:until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n87:help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n88:``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n89:(but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n90:\n91:>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n92:a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n93:\n94:In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n95:to make that decision. For example:\n96:\n97:>>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n98:... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n99:... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n100:... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n(2115 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sympy__sympy/sympy/simplify/fu.py)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",
