If Cython supported polymorphism, we would be able to\n14:# create a subclass and derive KDTree and BallTree from it.  Because\n15:# polymorphism is not an option, we use this single BinaryTree class\n16:# as a literal include to avoid duplicating the entire file.\n17:#\n18:# A series of functions are implemented in kd_tree.pyx and ball_tree.pyx\n19:# which use the information here to calculate the lower and upper bounds\n20:# between a node and a point, and between two nodes.  These functions are\n21:# used here, and are all that are needed to differentiate between the two\n22:# tree types.\n23:#\n24:# Description of Binary Tree Algorithms\n25:# -------------------------------------\n26:# A binary tree can be thought of as a collection of nodes.  The top node\n27:# contains all the points.  The next level consists of two nodes with half\n28:# the points in each, and this continues recursively.  Each node contains\n29:# metadata which allow fast computation of distance bounds: in the case of\n30:# a ball tree, the metadata is a center and a radius.  In the case of a\n31:# KD tree, the metadata is the minimum and maximum bound along each dimension.\n32:#\n33:# In a typical KD Tree or Ball Tree implementation, the nodes are implemented\n34:# as dynamically allocated structures with pointers linking them.  Here we\n35:# take a different approach, storing all relevant data in a set of arrays\n36:# so that the entire tree object can be saved in a pickle file. For efficiency,\n37:# the data can be stored in such a way that explicit pointers are not\n38:# necessary: for node data stored at index i, the two child nodes are at\n39:# index (2 * i + 1) and (2 * i + 2); the parent node is (i - 1) // 2\n40:# (where // indicates integer division).\n41:#\n42:# The data arrays used here are as follows:\n43:#   data : the [n_samples x n_features] array of data from which the tree\n44:#          is built\n45:#   idx_array : the length n_samples array used to keep track of the indices\n46:#          of data within each node.  Each node has values idx_start and\n47:#          idx_end: the points within the node are given by (using numpy\n48:#          syntax) data[idx_array[idx_start:idx_end]].\n49:#   node_data : the length n_nodes array of structures which store the node\n50:#          indices, node radii, and leaf information for each node.\n51:#   node_bounds : the [* x n_nodes x n_features] array containing the node\n52:#          bound information.  For ball tree, the first dimension is 1, and\n53:#          each row contains the centroid of the node.  For kd tree, the first\n54:#          dimension is 2 and the rows for each point contain the arrays of\n55:#          lower bounds and upper bounds in each direction.\n56:#\n57:# The lack of dynamic allocation means the number of nodes must be computed\n58:# before the building of the tree. This can be done assuming the points are\n59:# divided equally between child nodes at each step; although this removes\n60:# some flexibility in tree creation, it ensures a balanced tree and ensures\n61:# that the number of nodes required can be computed beforehand.  Given a\n62:# specified leaf_size (the minimum number of points in any node), it is\n63:# possible to show that a balanced tree will have\n64:#\n65:#     n_levels = 1 + max(0, floor(log2((n_samples - 1) / leaf_size)))\n66:#\n67:# in order to satisfy\n68:#\n69:#     leaf_size <= min(n_points) <= 2 * leaf_size\n70:#\n71:# with the exception of the special case where n_samples < leaf_size.\n72:# for a given number of levels, the number of nodes in the tree is given by\n73:#\n74:#     n_nodes = 2 ** n_levels - 1\n75:#\n76:# both these results can be straightforwardly shown by induction.  The\n77:# following code uses these values in the construction of the tree.\n78:#\n79:# Distance Metrics\n80:# ----------------\n81:# For flexibility, the trees can be built using a variety of distance metrics.\n82:# The metrics are described in the DistanceMetric class: the standard\n83:# Euclidean distance is the default, and is inlined to be faster than other\n84:# metrics.  In addition, each metric defines both a distance and a\n85:# \"reduced distance\", which is often faster to compute, and is therefore\n86:# used in the query architecture whenever possible. (For example, in the\n87:# case of the standard Euclidean distance, the reduced distance is the\n88:# squared-distance).\n89:#\n90:# Implementation Notes\n91:# --------------------\n92:# This implementation uses the common object-oriented approach of having an\n93:# abstract base class which is extended by the KDTree and BallTree\n94:# specializations.\n95:#\n96:# The BinaryTree \"base class\" is defined here and then subclassed in the BallTree\n97:# and KDTree pyx files. These files include implementations of the\n98:# \"abstract\" methods.\n99:\n100:# Necessary Helper Functions\n(2439 more lines below)\n",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nMissing parameter validation in Neighbors estimator for float n_neighbors\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\r\nX, y = make_blobs()\r\nneighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3.)\r\nneighbors.fit(X)\r\nneighbors.kneighbors(X)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n~/checkout/scikit-learn/sklearn/neighbors/binary_tree.pxi in sklearn.neighbors.kd_tree.NeighborsHeap.__init__()\r\n\r\nTypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer\r\n```\r\nThis should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised (or we could be lenient and cast to integer, but I think a better error might be better).\r\n\r\nWe need to make sure that \r\n```python\r\nneighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)\r\n```\r\nalso works.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$",

If Cython supported polymorphism, we would be able to\n14:# create a subclass and derive KDTree and BallTree from it.  Because\n15:# polymorphism is not an option, we use this single BinaryTree class\n16:# as a literal include to avoid duplicating the entire file.\n17:#\n18:# A series of functions are implemented in kd_tree.pyx and ball_tree.pyx\n19:# which use the information here to calculate the lower and upper bounds\n20:# between a node and a point, and between two nodes.  These functions are\n21:# used here, and are all that are needed to differentiate between the two\n22:# tree types.\n23:#\n24:# Description of Binary Tree Algorithms\n25:# -------------------------------------\n26:# A binary tree can be thought of as a collection of nodes.  The top node\n27:# contains all the points.  The next level consists of two nodes with half\n28:# the points in each, and this continues recursively.  Each node contains\n29:# metadata which allow fast computation of distance bounds: in the case of\n30:# a ball tree, the metadata is a center and a radius.  In the case of a\n31:# KD tree, the metadata is the minimum and maximum bound along each dimension.\n32:#\n33:# In a typical KD Tree or Ball Tree implementation, the nodes are implemented\n34:# as dynamically allocated structures with pointers linking them.  Here we\n35:# take a different approach, storing all relevant data in a set of arrays\n36:# so that the entire tree object can be saved in a pickle file. For efficiency,\n37:# the data can be stored in such a way that explicit pointers are not\n38:# necessary: for node data stored at index i, the two child nodes are at\n39:# index (2 * i + 1) and (2 * i + 2); the parent node is (i - 1) // 2\n40:# (where // indicates integer division).\n41:#\n42:# The data arrays used here are as follows:\n43:#   data : the [n_samples x n_features] array of data from which the tree\n44:#          is built\n45:#   idx_array : the length n_samples array used to keep track of the indices\n46:#          of data within each node.  Each node has values idx_start and\n47:#          idx_end: the points within the node are given by (using numpy\n48:#          syntax) data[idx_array[idx_start:idx_end]].\n49:#   node_data : the length n_nodes array of structures which store the node\n50:#          indices, node radii, and leaf information for each node.\n51:#   node_bounds : the [* x n_nodes x n_features] array containing the node\n52:#          bound information.  For ball tree, the first dimension is 1, and\n53:#          each row contains the centroid of the node.  For kd tree, the first\n54:#          dimension is 2 and the rows for each point contain the arrays of\n55:#          lower bounds and upper bounds in each direction.\n56:#\n57:# The lack of dynamic allocation means the number of nodes must be computed\n58:# before the building of the tree. This can be done assuming the points are\n59:# divided equally between child nodes at each step; although this removes\n60:# some flexibility in tree creation, it ensures a balanced tree and ensures\n61:# that the number of nodes required can be computed beforehand.  Given a\n62:# specified leaf_size (the minimum number of points in any node), it is\n63:# possible to show that a balanced tree will have\n64:#\n65:#     n_levels = 1 + max(0, floor(log2((n_samples - 1) / leaf_size)))\n66:#\n67:# in order to satisfy\n68:#\n69:#     leaf_size <= min(n_points) <= 2 * leaf_size\n70:#\n71:# with the exception of the special case where n_samples < leaf_size.\n72:# for a given number of levels, the number of nodes in the tree is given by\n73:#\n74:#     n_nodes = 2 ** n_levels - 1\n75:#\n76:# both these results can be straightforwardly shown by induction.  The\n77:# following code uses these values in the construction of the tree.\n78:#\n79:# Distance Metrics\n80:# ----------------\n81:# For flexibility, the trees can be built using a variety of distance metrics.\n82:# The metrics are described in the DistanceMetric class: the standard\n83:# Euclidean distance is the default, and is inlined to be faster than other\n84:# metrics.  In addition, each metric defines both a distance and a\n85:# \"reduced distance\", which is often faster to compute, and is therefore\n86:# used in the query architecture whenever possible. (For example, in the\n87:# case of the standard Euclidean distance, the reduced distance is the\n88:# squared-distance).\n89:#\n90:# Implementation Notes\n91:# --------------------\n92:# This implementation uses the common object-oriented approach of having an\n93:# abstract base class which is extended by the KDTree and BallTree\n94:# specializations.\n95:#\n96:# The BinaryTree \"base class\" is defined here and then subclassed in the BallTree\n97:# and KDTree pyx files. These files include implementations of the\n98:# \"abstract\" methods.\n99:\n100:# Necessary Helper Functions\n(2439 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn/sklearn/neighbors/binary_tree.pxi)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$",

This change should be applied carefully to maintain the integrity of the code and not introduce any side effects.\n\nLet's proceed to edit the line to cast `k` to an integer.\n\n",
