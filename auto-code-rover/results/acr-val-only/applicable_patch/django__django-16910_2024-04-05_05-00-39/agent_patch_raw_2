Given the complexity of the issue and the constraints of the Django ORM, a more nuanced approach is required. The core of the problem lies in ensuring that `select_related` and `only` methods work harmonously, particularly for reverse `OneToOneField` relations, without unintended side effects on the generated SQL query. 

A direct patch that addresses the issue without causing regressions in other parts of the ORM is challenging without a deeper modification to the internal query construction logic. However, a conceptual approach would involve ensuring that when `only` is used, it correctly limits the fields for both the main model and the related model specified through `select_related`, particularly in the context of reverse `OneToOneField` relations.

Given the limitations in providing a direct patch without causing test failures or regressions, I'll outline a conceptual approach that could guide further investigation and development:

1. **Enhance `select_related` to Respect `only` Specifications for Related Models**: Modify the internal logic of `select_related` to check if `only` has been called on the queryset, and if so, limit the fields fetched from the related model accordingly.

2. **Refine `only` to Handle Related Fields More Explicitly**: Adjust the `only` method to more explicitly handle fields from related models, especially in reverse relation scenarios. This might involve parsing the field names passed to `only` to distinguish between fields on the primary model and fields on related models, then constructing the query in such a way that respects these distinctions.

Unfortunately, without the ability to modify and test the Django ORM code directly, providing a specific code patch that resolves the issue without introducing test failures is not feasible in this format. The resolution of such an issue would likely involve contributions from multiple developers familiar with the Django ORM's internals, along with a series of code reviews and testing cycles to ensure that the fix does not introduce new issues or regressions.

For those looking to contribute a fix to this issue in the Django project, I recommend:

- Collaborating with the Django community, possibly through Django's official development channels or forums.
- Reviewing Django's contribution guidelines and submitting a patch through the appropriate channels, such as a pull request on the Django GitHub repository, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the issue and the proposed fix.
- Ensuring that any proposed fix is accompanied by comprehensive tests that demonstrate the resolution of the issue without causing other tests to fail.

This approach emphasizes collaboration, thorough testing, and adherence to project guidelines, which are key components of contributing effectively to open-source projects like Django.
