        "content": "Based on the search results, let's analyze the context and information we've gathered regarding the issue with `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()` crash on proxy models in Django:\n\n1. **CustomModel**: The search result for `CustomModel` shows it's a simple Django model with a custom field. This doesn't directly relate to the issue but provides context on the base model structure that `ProxyCustomModel` would inherit from. The absence of `ProxyCustomModel` and `AnotherModel` in the search results suggests that the issue might be more about Django's internal handling of proxy models and relations rather than something specific to the user-defined models.\n\n2. **select_related and only Methods**: The `select_related` and `only` methods are part of Django's `QuerySet` class. The documentation within the code for these methods provides insight into their intended use and restrictions. `select_related` is used for optimizing database queries by including related objects in the initial database query. The `only` method is essentially the opposite of `defer()`, loading only specified fields immediately when the queryset is evaluated. The error might stem from how these methods interact with proxy models and their fields.\n\n3. **Code Snippet with Potential Issue**: The search for the code snippet `opts = cur_model._meta` led us to a place in Django's codebase (`django/db/models/sql/query.py`) where the model's metadata is accessed. The issue description suggests changing this to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` to resolve the crash. This change aims to ensure that when dealing with proxy models, the system uses the metadata of the concrete model the proxy model is based on, rather than the proxy model's metadata, which might not have direct database fields associated with it.\n\nGiven this context, the problem seems to revolve around Django's handling of proxy models in conjunction with `select_related` and `only` methods. The suggested fix involves ensuring that Django accesses the concrete model's metadata, which has a direct representation in the database, thereby avoiding errors when trying to access fields that are not part of the proxy model's direct database representation.\n\nThe next step would be to consider how to apply this fix in a way that is consistent with Django's design principles and doesn't introduce other issues, especially considering backward compatibility and the potential impact on other parts of the framework that rely on the current behavior."
