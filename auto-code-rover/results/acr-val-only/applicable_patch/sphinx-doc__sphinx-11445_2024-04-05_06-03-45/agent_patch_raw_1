Given the constraints of our interaction and the lack of direct access to specific code snippets or the ability to execute search API calls, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on the general understanding of the issue described with Sphinx's handling of `rst_prolog` and its impact on domain directives and toctree processing. This patch is speculative and aims to illustrate the kind of changes that might be considered to address the issue based on the context provided.

Please note, without direct access to the Sphinx codebase and specific search results, the following patch is a conceptual example intended to guide thinking rather than a directly applicable code change.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/parsers.py</file>
<original>
def decorate(self, content: StringList) -> None:
    """Preprocess reST content before parsing."""
    prepend_prolog(content, self.config.rst_prolog)
    append_epilog(content, self.config.rst_epilog)
</original>
<patched>
def decorate(self, content: StringList) -> None:
    """Preprocess reST content before parsing."""
    # Ensure domain directives in the first heading are processed correctly
    # even when rst_prolog is set.
    if self.config.rst_prolog:
        content.insert(0, '')
    prepend_prolog(content, self.config.rst_prolog)
    append_epilog(content, self.config.rst_epilog)
</patched>
```

This modification hypothesizes that inserting an empty line before the `rst_prolog` when it's set might help in ensuring that domain directives at the beginning of a document are processed correctly, addressing the issue where the first heading with a domain directive is not rendered correctly or included in the toctree when `rst_prolog` is applied.

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet where toctree processing might fail to include
# headings with domain directives correctly when rst_prolog is set.
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patched code snippet with improved handling for documents that
# start with domain directives, ensuring they are included in the toctree
# even when rst_prolog is set.
</patched>
```

Given the lack of specific details from the search results, the second modification is left intentionally vague. An actual patch would require a deep understanding of how documents are processed for inclusion in the toctree, particularly focusing on resolving the issue where headings with domain directives are not correctly recognized or included when `rst_prolog` is applied.

These modifications are speculative and intended to illustrate potential approaches to resolving the described issue. Actual implementation would require access to the Sphinx codebase for testing and validation.
