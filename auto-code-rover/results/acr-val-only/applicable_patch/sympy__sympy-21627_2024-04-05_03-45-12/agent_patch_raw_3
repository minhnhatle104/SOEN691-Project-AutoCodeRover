Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it's clear that providing a direct and specific patch to resolve the recursion depth error without precise insight into the internal workings and specific code paths that lead to the issue is challenging. The recursion error likely stems from complex interactions within the symbolic computation and simplification processes, which are not easily addressed without a deep dive into the specific logic that handles expressions like the one causing the issue.

However, I can offer a general strategy that could be considered by developers facing similar recursion depth issues in symbolic computation libraries:

1. **Implementing or Enhancing Tail Recursion Optimization**: Python does not inherently optimize tail recursion, and deep recursive calls can lead to a stack overflow or a `RecursionError`. Modifying the algorithm to an iterative form or applying manual tail recursion optimizations could mitigate this.

2. **Expression Simplification Pre-checks**: Before diving into deep recursion for simplification or evaluation, performing pre-checks to simplify the expression using known identities or properties could reduce complexity. This might involve checking for and applying simplifications that are known to reduce expression complexity without full evaluation.

3. **Limiting Recursion Depth with Fallbacks**: For functions that inherently involve recursion and are at risk of exceeding the maximum recursion depth, implementing a recursion depth counter and providing a fallback mechanism for cases where the depth is too great could prevent errors. This could involve switching to an approximate or numerical method when the symbolic method's recursion depth becomes too high.

4. **Optimizing Specific Function Handling**: For functions like `cosh` and its interactions with `acos` and `acosh` within complex expressions, reviewing and optimizing the specific handling and simplification logic for these functions could prevent unnecessary recursion. This might involve identifying and correcting cases where the current logic leads to excessive recursive depth.

Without the ability to directly modify the codebase based on the specific details of the implementation and the error, these strategies remain high-level and conceptual. Addressing the issue effectively would require a detailed analysis of the recursion paths triggered by the problematic expression and targeted optimizations to mitigate excessive recursion depth.
