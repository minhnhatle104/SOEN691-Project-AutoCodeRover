Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific parts of the code where the recursion error occurs, it's challenging to provide an exact patch. However, I can suggest a conceptual approach that might help address the issue of recursion depth errors in symbolic computation libraries like SymPy, especially when dealing with complex expressions involving functions like `cosh`.

The issue seems to stem from the evaluation of complex expressions and the determination of whether such expressions are zero. A common approach to mitigate such issues involves implementing or enhancing existing mechanisms for expression simplification and evaluation to prevent deep recursion. This might include optimizing the evaluation paths or introducing iterative algorithms where recursion currently exists.

Since the provided context does not pinpoint the exact location of the recursion error beyond the interaction with `is_zero` and the use of `cosh`, and given the failure of the hypothetical patch, a more general approach to handling recursion errors in symbolic expressions is suggested below. This approach focuses on enhancing the expression simplification process to potentially reduce recursion depth.

# General Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>sympy/core/simplify.py</file>
<original>def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=None, rational=False, inverse=False, doit=True, **kwargs):
    ...
</original>
<patched>def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=None, rational=False, inverse=False, doit=True, max_depth=None, **kwargs):
    if max_depth is not None:
        # Implement a depth-limited simplification strategy
        # This is a conceptual patch. The actual implementation would need to track the depth of recursion
        # and limit the simplification process accordingly to avoid exceeding the maximum recursion depth.
        pass
    ...
</patched>
```

# Additional Conceptual Patch for Expression Evaluation

```python
<file>sympy/core/evaluation.py</file>  # Hypothetical file and function for expression evaluation
<original>def evaluate_expression(expr):
    ...
</original>
<patched>def evaluate_expression(expr, max_depth=None):
    # Conceptual change to add a maximum depth parameter to the evaluation function
    # This would involve modifying the evaluation logic to track recursion depth and halt if the limit is reached
    ...
</patched>
```

These patches are conceptual and aim to illustrate a potential direction for mitigating recursion depth issues by introducing depth limits in the simplification and evaluation processes. Implementing these changes would require a detailed understanding of the internal workings of SymPy, particularly how expressions are simplified and evaluated. The actual implementation would need to carefully track recursion depth across potentially multiple recursive calls and halt or alter the computation strategy when a certain depth is reached to prevent `RecursionError`.

Given the complexity of symbolic computation and the variety of expressions SymPy can handle, any changes would need to be thoroughly tested to ensure they do not negatively impact the library's functionality or performance.
