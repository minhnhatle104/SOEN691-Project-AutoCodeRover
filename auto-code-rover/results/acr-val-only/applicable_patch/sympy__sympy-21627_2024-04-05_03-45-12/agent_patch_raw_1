Given the nature of the issue and the analysis provided, without specific details on the exact cause of the recursion error within the codebase, it's challenging to write a precise patch. However, I can propose a general approach to mitigate recursion depth errors in scenarios like the one described. This approach involves adding a depth check in recursive functions or improving the handling of complex expressions to prevent deep recursion. Since the exact location and cause of the bug are not pinpointed, the following patch is hypothetical and aims to illustrate a potential method to address recursion issues in a generic manner.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/exprtools.py</file>
<original>def is_zero(self):  # Factors
    """
    >>> from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors
    >>> Factors(0).is_zero
    True
    """
    f = self.factors
    return len(f) == 1 and S.Zero in f
</original>
<patched>def is_zero(self, depth=0):  # Factors
    """
    >>> from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors
    >>> Factors(0).is_zero
    True
    """
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth exceeded in is_zero")
    f = self.factors
    return len(f) == 1 and S.Zero in f
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py</file>
<original>Unfortunately, the exact implementation details of `cosh` or related functions and their interaction with `is_zero` were not provided, making it impossible to offer a precise original and patched code snippet.</original>
<patched>One potential approach to mitigate deep recursion errors could involve adding checks or optimizations in the evaluation of hyperbolic functions when they are part of complex expressions, especially before they interact with methods like `is_zero`. This might involve implementing more efficient algorithms for simplification or adding conditions to prevent unnecessary recursion.</patched>
```

Please note, the above modifications are illustrative and based on a hypothetical understanding of the issue. In practice, addressing the recursion depth error would require a detailed investigation into the specific expressions and functions involved, as well as a thorough understanding of the recursion paths that lead to the error. The modifications would need to be tested extensively to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new bugs or performance issues.
