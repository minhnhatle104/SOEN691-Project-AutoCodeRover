Explanation:
- **Modification 1**: Adds a `__rand__` method to the `Q` class. This method is essentially the same as the `__and__` method because the logical AND operation is commutative, meaning the order of operands should not affect the result. This change allows an `Exists` instance to be on the right side of an `&` operation with a `Q` instance on the left.
  
- **Modification 2**: Adds a `__rand__` method to the `Exists` class. This method checks if the other operand (expected to be a `Q` instance when this issue arises) has a `_combine` method, which it should if it's a `Q` instance. It then calls this method, effectively allowing `Q` and `Exists` instances to be combined regardless of their order in an `&` operation. The error handling with `TypeError` ensures that if an incompatible type is used with `Exists`, a clear and informative error message is provided.

These modifications address the issue by implementing the missing `__rand__` methods, thus allowing `Q` and `Exists` instances to be used interchangeably on either side of an `&` operation without raising a `TypeError`.
