Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, let's revise the approach. The goal remains to enable `Q` and `Exists` objects to be combined using `&` in either order without raising a `TypeError`. The issue likely stems from the handling of these operations and the absence of `__rand__` methods. However, the initial attempt might have overlooked the correct integration with Django's query composition logic.

Upon reevaluation, a more precise approach is needed, particularly in ensuring that the `Exists` object can correctly integrate with a `Q` object when `Exists` is on the left side of the `&` operation. Since `Exists` does not naturally support logical operations with `Q` objects, we need to ensure that when `Exists` is on the left, the operation is correctly delegated to the `Q` object on the right, if applicable. 

Let's correct the approach by focusing on ensuring that the `Exists` class can properly delegate the operation to a `Q` object through `__rand__`, and that `Q` objects can handle `Exists` objects in their `_combine` method, if necessary.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query_utils.py</file>
<original>        if not isinstance(other, Q):
            raise TypeError(other)</original>
<patched>        from django.db.models.expressions import Exists
        if not isinstance(other, (Q, Exists)):
            raise TypeError(f"Cannot combine 'Q' with '{type(other)}'")
        # Special handling to integrate Exists objects directly into Q objects.
        if isinstance(other, Exists):
            # Convert Exists object into a Q object for proper combination.
            other = Q(_exists=other)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>    def __init__(self, queryset, negated=False, **kwargs):
        self.negated = negated
        super().__init__(queryset, **kwargs)</original>
<patched>    def __init__(self, queryset, negated=False, **kwargs):
        self.negated = negated
        super().__init__(queryset, **kwargs)
    
    # Ensure Exists can be on the left side of & operation with Q objects.
    def __rand__(self, other):
        # Directly return other.__and__(self) to delegate to Q's __and__.
        return other.__and__(self)</patched>
```

Explanation:
- **Modification 1**: Adjusts the `_combine` method in the `Q` class to accept `Exists` objects by checking if `other` is an instance of `Exists` and then converting it into a `Q` object. This allows for a more seamless integration of `Exists` into the logical operations of `Q` objects. The conversion process might need further refinement to ensure it aligns with Django's query construction logic.

- **Modification 2**: Implements a `__rand__` method in the `Exists` class that directly delegates the operation to the `other` object's `__and__` method, assuming `other` is a `Q` object. This ensures that when an `Exists` object is on the left side of an `&` operation, it correctly integrates with the `Q` object on the right.

This revised approach aims to address the issue more precisely by ensuring proper delegation and conversion between `Exists` and `Q` objects during logical operations.
