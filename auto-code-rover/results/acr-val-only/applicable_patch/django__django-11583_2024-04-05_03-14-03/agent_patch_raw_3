Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the initial approach to directly address the handling of file paths with null bytes might not be the correct path to resolving the issue. The challenge seems to stem from a deeper issue within the Django's `StatReloader` mechanism or how Python's `Pathlib` and file system operations interact, especially under specific conditions that are hard to replicate consistently.

Since direct modifications to handle or log null byte paths have not resolved the issue and have led to test failures, a different strategy might be needed. Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations in reproducing it, a hypothetical patch might involve adding a more robust error handling mechanism around the file path resolution process to gracefully handle unexpected errors and ensure the reloader's stability.

However, without being able to directly modify and test the code or having more detailed error logs from the test failures, proposing a new patch without potentially introducing more issues becomes speculative. In real-world scenarios, this situation would likely require:

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Temporarily adding more detailed logging around the file resolution and modification time checking process to capture more context about when and why failures occur.
2. **Collaboration with Python/Pathlib Developers**: Since the issue might involve interactions with the Python standard library, reaching out to the developers of Python or contributing a bug report to the Python issue tracker with detailed information might uncover known issues or lead to suggestions for workarounds.
3. **Community Feedback**: Sharing the problem and attempted solutions in developer forums or Django's community channels might elicit feedback from others who have encountered similar issues or have insights into potential solutions.

Given these considerations, a speculative patch focusing on enhanced error handling and logging might look like this:

# Speculative Patch for Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
```python
<file>django/utils/autoreload.py</file>
<original>    def snapshot_files(self):
        # watched_files may produce duplicate paths if globs overlap.
        seen_files = set()
        for file in self.watched_files():
            if file in seen_files:
                continue
            try:
                mtime = file.stat().st_mtime
            except OSError:
                # This is thrown when the file does not exist.
                continue
            seen_files.add(file)
            yield file, mtime
</original>
<patched>    def snapshot_files(self):
        # watched_files may produce duplicate paths if globs overlap.
        seen_files = set()
        for file in self.watched_files():
            if file in seen_files:
                continue
            try:
                # Attempt to resolve the path and check modification time
                resolved_path = file.resolve(strict=False)
                mtime = resolved_path.stat().st_mtime
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error("Failed to process file %s: %s", file, e)
                continue
            seen_files.add(file)
            yield file, mtime
</patched>
```

This speculative patch aims to catch a broader range of exceptions during file path resolution and modification time checking, logging errors for further investigation. It's important to note that without specific insights into the test failures or being able to replicate the issue, any modification carries the risk of not addressing the underlying problem or introducing new issues.
