Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's revise the approach. The problem seems to stem from handling file paths that may contain null bytes, which are not valid in file paths and cause `ValueError` when encountered by operations such as `os.readlink`. Since the direct search for `os.readlink` did not yield results, and considering the nature of the error, the issue likely arises from how file paths are handled or resolved within the `snapshot_files` method. 

A more robust approach might involve ensuring that file paths are sanitized before any operations are performed on them. However, since the direct manipulation of file paths to remove or check for null bytes before using them did not resolve the issue, we might need to consider a different strategy that focuses on the point where file paths are collected or used.

                if '\x00' in file_path_str:
                    logger.warning("Ignoring file due to null byte in path: %s", file_path_str)
                    continue
                # Use os.path.getmtime for compatibility and direct filesystem access
                mtime = os.path.getmtime(file_path_str)
            except OSError as e:
                logger.error("Error accessing file %s: %s", file, e)
                continue
            seen_files.add(file)
            yield file, mtime
</patched>
```

This revised patch focuses on converting the `Path` object to a string representation more cautiously and uses `file.resolve(strict=False)` to attempt resolving the path without raising an exception for non-existent files. This approach aims to catch scenarios where the path might be problematic (e.g., contains a null byte) before attempting to get its modification time with `os.path.getmtime`, which directly accesses the filesystem and might handle paths differently than `Pathlib`.

Additionally, this patch includes more explicit error logging to aid in diagnosing issues when accessing files fails, providing clearer insight into the nature of the errors encountered. This should help in identifying if the issue persists due to null bytes in paths or if there are other underlying problems that need to be addressed.
