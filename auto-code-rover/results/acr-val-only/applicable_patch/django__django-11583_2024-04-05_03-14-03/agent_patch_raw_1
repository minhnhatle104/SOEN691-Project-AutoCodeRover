```

The first modification adds a check in the `snapshot_files` method to ensure that file paths converted to strings do not contain null bytes before proceeding with the rest of the method's logic. This approach aims to prevent the `ValueError: embedded null byte` from being raised by preemptively filtering out paths that would cause the issue. The second modification is included for completeness, indicating that no changes were made to the `tick` method but emphasizing the need for consistent handling of file paths across methods related to file monitoring and auto-reloading.
