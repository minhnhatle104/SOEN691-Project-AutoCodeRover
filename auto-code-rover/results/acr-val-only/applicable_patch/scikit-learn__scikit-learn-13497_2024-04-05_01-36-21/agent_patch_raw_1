These modifications address the issue by ensuring that `discrete_features` is properly validated and handled. The first modification adds a check to ensure that `discrete_features` is either `'auto'`, a boolean, a list of indices, or a boolean mask array, and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. The second modification refines the handling of `discrete_features` when it is an array, distinguishing between boolean masks and arrays of indices, and adds appropriate error messages to guide the user. This should prevent future errors related to the handling of `discrete_features` and make the function more robust and easier to use correctly.
