Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's revise the approach. The goal remains to ensure that an empty `__all__` attribute results in no members being documented. It seems the modifications need to be more focused on how the `__all__` attribute is interpreted during the documentation process, particularly in the `ModuleDocumenter` class where module members are determined for documentation.

Upon reevaluation, it appears the initial approach might not have fully addressed the core issue of how members are selected for documentation based on the `__all__` attribute. Let's adjust the strategy to more directly influence this selection process.

# Revised modification
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>if want_all:
            if not self.__all__:
                # for implicit module members, check __module__ to avoid
                # documenting imported objects
                return True, list(members.values())
            else:
                for member in members.values():
                    if member.__name__ not in self.__all__:
                        member.skipped = True

                return False, list(members.values())</original>
<patched>if want_all:
            if hasattr(self, '__all__') and self.__all__ is not None:
                if not self.__all__:
                    # If __all__ is explicitly empty, consider no members for documentation
                    return False, []
                else:
                    # Filter members based on __all__
                    filtered_members = [member for member in members.values() if member.__name__ in self.__all__]
                    return False, filtered_members
            else:
                # for implicit module members, check __module__ to avoid
                # documenting imported objects
                return True, list(members.values())</patched>
```

This revised modification explicitly checks if `__all__` is defined and not `None` before proceeding with the member filtering logic. If `__all__` is present and empty, it returns an empty list of members, effectively documenting no members. This approach directly addresses the issue of an empty `__all__` being ignored and ensures that the documentation process respects the explicit intention to document no members.
