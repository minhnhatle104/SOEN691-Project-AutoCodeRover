The bug report indicates that an empty `__all__` list is being ignored, leading to all functions being documented instead of none. \n\nGiven this context, I will perform the following API calls to gather more information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AutoDoc\")`: Since the issue is related to the autodoc functionality of Sphinx, searching for a class related to autodoc (like `AutoDoc` or similarly named classes) could provide insight into where the handling of the `__all__` attribute is implemented.\n\n2. `search_method(\"process_members\")`: This method name is a guess based on common naming conventions for processing members of a module or class in documentation tools. If there's a method responsible for deciding which members to document based on the `__all__` attribute, it might be named something like this.\n\n3. `search_code(\"__all__\")`: Searching for the `__all__` string in the codebase can help locate where it is being checked or used within the autodoc extension or related modules. This can lead us directly to the logic that needs to be patched.\n\nThese searches are designed to locate the relevant parts of the codebase where the issue might be originating from, allowing for a more targeted approach to patching the bug."

        "content": "Based on the search results, it appears there is no class named `AutoDoc` or a method named `process_members` directly related to our issue in the codebase. However, the search for `__all__` has yielded several promising leads across different files, particularly within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` directory and its `__init__.py` file, which contains 16 matches for `__all__`. This suggests that the handling of the `__all__` attribute and its impact on documentation generation is likely managed within this part of the Sphinx codebase.\n\nGiven these findings, the most relevant files for further investigation are:\n\n1. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`: With the highest number of matches for `__all__`, this file is very likely to contain the logic that determines how the `__all__` attribute influences which module members are documented. The issue might stem from how an empty `__all__` list is interpreted or possibly ignored.\n\n2. `sphinx/util/inspect.py`: This file also has a significant number of matches for `__all__` and could contain utility functions or methods that are used by the autodoc extension to inspect module contents, including the `__all__` attribute.\n\nThe other files might also play a role, especially if they define behaviors or utilities used by the autodoc extension, but the two files listed above are the most promising starting points for addressing the reported issue.\n\nTo proceed, we should focus on understanding how `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/util/inspect.py` handle the `__all__` attribute, particularly in cases where it is defined but empty. This will involve examining the relevant code snippets within these files to identify where the logic might be failing to respect an empty `__all__` list."

The findings indicate that the `__all__` attribute is referenced in several methods across two files, which are likely candidates for where the bug could be located.\n\n### `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\nIn this file, the `__all__` attribute is involved in multiple methods:\n- `filter_members`: This method likely filters which members of a module or class are included in the documentation. The presence of `__all__` here suggests it could be directly involved in deciding whether a member is documented based on the contents of `__all__`.\n- `__init__`: The constructor of a class might be using `__all__` to initialize some settings or configurations related to member documentation.\n- `import_object`: With the highest number of matches, this method possibly deals with importing the module or object to be documented and might use `__all__` to determine which members are available for documentation.\n- `get_object_members`: This method likely retrieves the members of an object for documentation purposes. Its use of `__all__` could be crucial in filtering members based on the attribute's contents.\n- `sort_members`: While sorting might not directly influence whether a member is documented, the use of `__all__` here could affect the order in which members are processed or displayed.\n\n### `sphinx/util/inspect.py`\n- `getall`: This method, with all matches related to `__all__`, is likely a utility function used to retrieve all members of a module or class, potentially respecting the `__all__` attribute. Given its utility nature, this function might be called by various parts of the autodoc extension.\n\n### Analysis\nGiven the information at hand, the bug is likely to be located in the methods that directly influence which members are documented based on the `__all__` attribute. Specifically, the `filter_members` and `get_object_members` methods in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` are strong candidates. These methods are directly involved in determining which members to include in the documentation, and any issues in how they handle an empty `__all__` list could lead to the described bug.\n\nThe `import_object` method also stands out due to the number of matches and its role in importing objects for documentation, which could involve interpreting `__all__`.\n\nThe `getall` method in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` is another potential location, especially if it's used by the autodoc extension to gather members for documentation and incorrectly handles empty `__all__` lists.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo address the issue, the next steps would involve reviewing the implementation of these methods to understand how they handle the `__all__` attribute, especially when it's empty. The goal would be to ensure that an empty `__all__` list results in no members being documented, as expected."
