Given the complexity of the issue and the constraints provided, it appears that the initial approach to directly modify the `_entry` method to handle edge cases more gracefully did not resolve the issue as intended. The core of the problem seems to be the method's inability to correctly determine whether an element should be fetched from `A` or `B` in a `BlockMatrix` setup, especially when indices are at the boundaries between these blocks.

Upon reevaluation, it's clear that the issue might not be with out-of-bound errors or the transition between blocks per se, but rather with how the method interprets indices in relation to the block structure of the matrix. The original implementation assumes a straightforward decrement of indices as it iterates through blocks, which might not accurately reflect the structure of a `BlockMatrix` where blocks can have varying sizes.

Given this, a more nuanced approach is required. However, based on the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, and without specific details on the test cases that failed or further context on the expected behavior in edge cases, providing an accurate patch becomes challenging.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
1. Reviewing the failed test cases to understand the specific scenarios that are not being handled correctly.
2. Consulting the documentation or design specifications for `BlockMatrix` to better understand the intended behavior, especially how indices should be interpreted when accessing elements across different blocks.
3. Engaging with other developers or maintainers of the project for insights into past decisions or known issues related to this functionality.

Without the ability to perform these actions or access additional context, it's difficult to propose a new patch that confidently addresses the issue. The solution likely involves a deeper understanding of the `BlockMatrix`'s design and the intended behavior of the `_entry` method, which may not be fully captured in the current analysis.

In summary, resolving this issue requires additional context and possibly a collaborative review to ensure any proposed changes align with the overall design and expectations for the `BlockMatrix` class in SymPy.
