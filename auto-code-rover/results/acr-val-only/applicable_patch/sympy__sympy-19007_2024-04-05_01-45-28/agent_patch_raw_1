```

This patch addresses the issue by explicitly checking if the indices `i` and `j` are out of bounds after the loops for determining the row and column blocks. If either `row_block` or `col_block` is not set (i.e., remains `None`), it indicates that the provided index is out of the range of the matrix, and an `IndexError` is raised accordingly. This ensures that the method behaves correctly when indices are at or beyond the boundaries of the block matrix, providing clearer error handling and preventing incorrect element access.
