Given the constraints and the failure of the initial approach, let's consider a different strategy that directly addresses the issue of simplifying expressions with floating-point exponents. The problem seems to arise from the handling of floating-point numbers during the simplification process. A more targeted approach could involve enhancing the comparison or simplification logic for expressions involving floating-point exponents to ensure they are correctly identified as equivalent and simplified accordingly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>expr = bottom_up(expr, lambda w: w.normal())
expr = Mul(*powsimp(expr).as_content_primitive())</original>
<patched>from sympy.core.power import Pow
from sympy.core.mul import Mul
from sympy.core.numbers import Float

def custom_simplify_pow(expr):
    """Custom function to simplify expressions with floating-point exponents."""
    if isinstance(expr, Pow) and isinstance(expr.exp, Float):
        # Convert floating-point exponents to a rational approximation if possible
        rational_exp = expr.exp.limit_denominator()
        return Pow(expr.base, rational_exp)
    return expr

expr = bottom_up(expr, custom_simplify_pow)
expr = Mul(*powsimp(expr).as_content_primitive())</patched>
```

Explanation:
This patch introduces a custom function `custom_simplify_pow` within the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` that specifically targets expressions of the form `Pow` with floating-point exponents. The idea is to convert floating-point exponents into their rational approximations using the `limit_denominator()` method, which can then be more easily simplified. This approach aims to address the core issue where expressions with floating-point exponents are not simplified as expected due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic. By converting these exponents to rational numbers, we increase the likelihood that SymPy's existing simplification logic can correctly identify and simplify equivalent expressions. This modification is applied to the expression using the `bottom_up` traversal, ensuring that all instances of `Pow` with floating-point exponents are processed.
