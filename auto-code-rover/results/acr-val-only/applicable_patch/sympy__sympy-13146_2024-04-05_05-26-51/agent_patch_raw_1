Explanation:
The patch introduces an additional step in the `simplify` function within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` to handle expressions involving floating-point numbers more effectively. After the existing simplification strategies are applied, the patch attempts to evaluate the expression using `evalf`. If this evaluated expression is simpler (as determined by the `measure` function) than the original expression (within the specified `ratio`), it replaces the current `expr` with this evaluated form. This approach aims to address the issue where expressions with floating-point exponents do not simplify as expected, by leveraging the evaluation of floating-point numbers to potentially simplify the expression further. If the evaluation does not result in a simpler expression, the function falls back to the existing behavior.
