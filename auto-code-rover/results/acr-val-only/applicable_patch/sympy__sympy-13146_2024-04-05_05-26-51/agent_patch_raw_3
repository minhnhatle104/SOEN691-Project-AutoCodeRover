Given the constraints and the failure of the previous approaches, let's consider a more direct approach to address the issue of simplifying expressions with floating-point exponents. The problem seems to be that the expression does not simplify to 0 due to the presence of floating-point numbers, which can introduce precision issues. A potential solution is to enhance the logic for handling floating-point numbers in expressions, ensuring that equivalent terms are recognized and simplified correctly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>if not isinstance(expr, Basic):  # XXX: temporary hack
        return expr</original>
<patched>from sympy import nsimplify
# Attempt to simplify numerical expressions to a simpler form
expr = nsimplify(expr)
if not isinstance(expr, Basic):  # XXX: temporary hack
        return expr</patched>
```

Explanation:
This patch introduces the use of `nsimplify` within the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. The `nsimplify` function attempts to convert numerical expressions (including those with floating-point numbers) into a simpler symbolic form, which might include rational numbers or simpler constants. By applying `nsimplify` before the final check on the type of the expression, we aim to address the issue where expressions with floating-point exponents do not simplify as expected. This approach leverages SymPy's capability to recognize and simplify numerical values to symbolic forms, potentially allowing expressions that are equivalent but involve floating-point numbers to be simplified more effectively. This modification is strategically placed to ensure that it is applied to the expression after other simplification strategies have been attempted, providing a final pass to simplify numerical expressions further.

This approach directly targets the problem of expressions not simplifying to 0 when they involve floating-point numbers, by leveraging `nsimplify` to potentially convert these numbers into forms that can be more easily simplified or recognized as equivalent.
