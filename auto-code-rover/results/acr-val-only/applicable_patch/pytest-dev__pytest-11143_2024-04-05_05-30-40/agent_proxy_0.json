            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about how the pytest assertion rewriting mechanism works, specifically how it handles the docstrings or the first expression in a file which might be causing the error when it's a number and not a string (docstring). The error trace points to several methods involved in the process, such as `exec_module`, `_rewrite_test`, `rewrite_asserts`, and `is_rewrite_disabled` within the pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism. \n\nGiven this, we should look into the implementation of these methods to understand how they are handling the docstrings or the first expression in a file, and why an integer value is causing a `TypeError`. \n\nLet's start by searching for the relevant methods and code snippets:\n\n1. `search_method(\"exec_module\")`: To understand how modules are executed and how the initial parsing of the file is handled.\n2. `search_method(\"_rewrite_test\")`: This method likely handles the rewriting of assertions, so understanding its implementation will be key.\n3. `search_method(\"rewrite_asserts\")`: Since the traceback points to this method as part of the process where the error occurs, it's crucial to understand its logic.\n4. `search_method(\"is_rewrite_disabled\")`: This method seems to directly interact with the docstring or the first expression in a file, leading to the error when it's not iterable.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to understand the issue and devise a solution."
