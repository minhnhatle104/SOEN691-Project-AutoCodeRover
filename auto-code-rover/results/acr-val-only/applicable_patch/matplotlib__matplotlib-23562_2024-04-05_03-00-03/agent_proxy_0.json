Given the traceback, it's clear that the `get_facecolors` method is attempting to access an attribute `_facecolors2d` that does not exist on the `Poly3DCollection` object. To understand the structure and intended behavior of both the class and the method, we should start by looking into their definitions and any relevant code snippets.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. **Search for the `Poly3DCollection` class**: This will help us understand the structure of the class and see if `_facecolors2d` is defined or used elsewhere within the class.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Poly3DCollection\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `get_facecolors` method within the `Poly3DCollection` class**: This will provide us with the method's implementation details and how it's supposed to interact with `_facecolors2d`.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"get_facecolors\", \"Poly3DCollection\")`\n\nThese calls should give us a good starting point to understand the issue and think about potential fixes."
