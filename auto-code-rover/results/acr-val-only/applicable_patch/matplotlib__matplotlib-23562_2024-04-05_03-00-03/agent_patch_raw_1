<original>def get_edgecolor(self):
    return self._edgecolors2d</original>
<patched>def get_edgecolor(self):
    # Ensure _edgecolors2d is initialized before accessing
    if hasattr(self, '_edgecolors2d'):
        return self._edgecolors2d
    else:
        # Fallback to the 3D edgecolor if _edgecolors2d is not available
        return self._edgecolor3d</patched>
```

These modifications ensure that attempts to access `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` in the `Poly3DCollection` class do not result in an AttributeError by checking for the attribute's existence first. If these attributes are not set, the methods fallback to using the 3D versions of these colors (`_facecolor3d` and `_edgecolor3d`), which should always be available. This approach provides a safer way to access these properties and avoids the issue encountered.
