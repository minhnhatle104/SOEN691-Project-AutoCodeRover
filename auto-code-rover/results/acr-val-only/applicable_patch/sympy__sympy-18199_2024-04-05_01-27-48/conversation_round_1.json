        "content": "Based on the information provided from the search result, the `nthroot_mod` function is designed to solve equations of the form \\(x^n = a \\mod p\\), where `a`, `n`, and `p` are integers, with `n` and `p` being positive. The function is located in the file `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py` within the SymPy library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.\n\nThe function signature is `nthroot_mod(a, n, p, all_roots=False)`, where:\n- `a` is the integer on the right-hand side of the equation \\(x^n = a\\).\n- `n` is the exponent on `x`.\n- `p` is the modulus.\n- `all_roots` is a boolean flag that, when set to `True`, makes the function return all roots of the equation instead of just the smallest one.\n\nThe issue reported is that the function misses a root when \\(a \\mod p = 0\\), specifically, it does not return \\(x = 0 \\mod p\\) as a root of the equation. This is a valid concern because, mathematically, if \\(a \\mod p = 0\\), then \\(x = 0\\) is indeed a root of the equation \\(x^n = a \\mod p\\), regardless of the value of `n`.\n\nThe current implementation starts by converting `a`, `n`, and `p` to integers and then proceeds with various checks and computations to find the roots. It checks if `n` equals `2` to handle square roots separately, verifies if `a` is an nth power residue modulo `p`, and raises an error if `p` is not prime. It then uses number theory methods to compute the roots, depending on the relationship between `n` and `p-1`, and the value of `n`.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to insert a check early in the function to see if `a % p == 0` and, if so, include `0` in the list of roots or return it directly if `all_roots` is `False`. This modification ensures that the function correctly handles cases where \\(a \\mod p = 0\\), thereby fixing the reported bug."
