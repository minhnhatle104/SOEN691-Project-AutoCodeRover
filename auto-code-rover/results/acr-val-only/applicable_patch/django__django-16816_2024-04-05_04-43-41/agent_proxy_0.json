            "content": "To understand the context and potentially find a solution for the reported issue, I will need to invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. To understand how the `Question` and `Choice` models are defined and how they relate to each other, which might give insight into why specifying `list_display = [\"choice\"]` in `QuestionAdmin` could cause an issue:\n   - `search_class(\"Question\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Choice\")`\n\n2. Since the error occurs when visiting `/admin/polls/question/` and involves `QuestionAdmin`, it's important to look into how `QuestionAdmin` is defined and how it's attempting to use the `choice` field:\n   - `search_class(\"QuestionAdmin\")`\n\n3. The traceback mentions several methods and files where the error propagates. Understanding these methods and their roles in rendering the admin page could provide clues on where the handling of `list_display` might be failing or how it could be improved to cover the case described in the issue:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"label_for_field\", \"/django/contrib/admin/utils.py\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"_get_non_gfk_field\", \"/django/contrib/admin/utils.py\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"result_list\", \"/django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_list.py\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the involved components and their interactions, which is crucial for diagnosing the issue and proposing a suitable patch."
