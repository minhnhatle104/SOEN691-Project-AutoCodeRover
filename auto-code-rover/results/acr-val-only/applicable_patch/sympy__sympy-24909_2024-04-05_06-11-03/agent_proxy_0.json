            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `milli` prefix and the `W` (watt) unit are implemented and how they interact in the codebase. The issue description suggests that the multiplication operation between a prefix (like `milli`) and a unit (like `W`) is not behaving as expected. Specifically, `milli*W` should result in `milli watts` but instead evaluates to `1`, and `W*milli` results in an unexpected string representation.\n\nGiven this, we should look into the implementation of the `milli` prefix, the `W` unit, and the multiplication operation that involves these entities. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the class that implements the `milli` prefix to understand its properties and methods.\n2. Search for the class that implements the `W` (watt) unit to understand its properties and methods.\n3. Search for the method that handles the multiplication operation, likely to be involved in the issue.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Prefix\")\nsearch_class(\"Watt\")\nsearch_method(\"__mul__\")\n```"
