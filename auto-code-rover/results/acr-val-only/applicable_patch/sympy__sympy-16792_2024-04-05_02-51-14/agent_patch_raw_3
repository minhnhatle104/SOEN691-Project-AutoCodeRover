Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial approach did not resolve the issue, let's consider a theoretical approach to address the problem based on the provided context and typical practices in handling such issues in code generation systems. This approach will focus on ensuring that `MatrixSymbol` arguments are correctly treated as arrays in the generated code, even when they are not directly used in the expression.

### Theoretical Patch

#### Modification to Ensure Correct Argument Handling in CythonCodeWrapper

The core of the issue seems to be that `MatrixSymbol` arguments are not correctly recognized as arrays when they are not used in the expression. A more robust check in the argument handling within the `CythonCodeWrapper` class could ensure that these arguments are always treated appropriately.

```python
<file>sympy/utilities/autowrap.py</file>
<original>if arg.dimensions:
    t = arg.get_datatype('c')
    return "<{0}*> {1}.data".format(t, self._string_var(arg.name))
elif isinstance(arg, ResultBase):
    return "&{0}".format(self._string_var(arg.name))
else:
    return self._string_var(arg.name)</original>
<patched>if arg.dimensions or isinstance(arg, MatrixSymbol):
    t = arg.get_datatype('c')
    # Ensure we treat MatrixSymbol as an array, defaulting to double* for simplicity
    t = "double" if isinstance(arg, MatrixSymbol) else t
    return "<{0}*> {1}.data".format(t, self._string_var(arg.name))
elif isinstance(arg, ResultBase):
    return "&{0}".format(self._string_var(arg.name))
else:
    return self._string_var(arg.name)</patched>
```

#### Ensuring Correct Code Generation in CodeGen

Additionally, in the `CodeGen` class, when generating the routine, there should be a clear distinction made for `MatrixSymbol` to ensure they are handled as arrays, not scalars.

```python
<file>sympy/utilities/codegen.py</file>
<original>if symbol in array_symbols:
    dims = []
    array = array_symbols[symbol]
    for dim in array.shape:
        dims.append((S.Zero, dim - 1))
    metadata = {'dimensions': dims}
else:
    metadata = {}</original>
<patched>if symbol in array_symbols or isinstance(symbol, MatrixSymbol):
    dims = []
    if isinstance(symbol, MatrixSymbol):
        array = symbol
    else:
        array = array_symbols[symbol]
    for dim in array.shape:
        dims.append((S.Zero, dim - 1))
    metadata = {'dimensions': dims}
else:
    metadata = {}</patched>
```

### Note

This theoretical patch aims to address the issue by ensuring that `MatrixSymbol` arguments are always treated as arrays in the generated Cython code, regardless of their direct usage in the expression. It's important to note that actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full context of the codebase and testing against the specific scenarios described in the issue.

In a real-world scenario, after applying such changes, it would be crucial to run the full test suite of the project to ensure that these modifications do not introduce regressions elsewhere in the system. Additionally, collaboration with other developers familiar with the `sympy` codebase and potentially reviewing similar issues or contributions in the project's issue tracker or pull requests could provide further insights and validation for the proposed solution.
