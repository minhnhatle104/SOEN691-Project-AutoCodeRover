Given the constraints and the failure of the initial patch, let's reconsider the approach, focusing on ensuring that `MatrixSymbol` arguments are always treated as arrays, regardless of their direct use in the expression. The issue seems to stem from the handling of arguments that are not explicitly used in the expression, leading to incorrect type inference for the generated C function signature. 

Since the initial attempt to directly modify the argument handling did not resolve the issue, a more targeted approach might be necessary. Specifically, we need to ensure that the generated Cython code correctly interprets unused `MatrixSymbol` arguments as pointers (arrays) rather than scalars. This might involve ensuring that such arguments are always considered in the context of their potential as arrays, even if not directly referenced in the expression.

However, based on the constraints and the feedback that the provided patches did not resolve the issue, and without further specific details on the test failures or additional context from the codebase, crafting a precise and effective patch becomes speculative. In a real-world scenario, this would be the stage to:

1. Review test cases that failed to understand the specific conditions under which the patch does not behave as expected.
2. Debug the code generation process step by step to see how `MatrixSymbol` arguments are handled and where the type inference diverges from the expected behavior.
3. Consult with additional documentation or developers familiar with the `sympy.utilities.autowrap` and code generation internals for insights into known limitations or behaviors that might affect the handling of such arguments.

Given the limitations of this interaction model, where iterative debugging and access to the full codebase and test suite are not possible, providing a further refined patch without additional context is challenging. The next steps in a real-world scenario would involve the actions listed above to gather more information and iteratively refine the approach based on feedback from test failures and debugging insights.
