        "content": "<issue>autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\nexpr = 1.0\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\n```python\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\n```\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\n```C\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\ndouble autofunc_result;\nautofunc_result = 1.0;\nreturn autofunc_result;\n}\n```\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\n# now output depends on x\nexpr = x[0,0]\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n</issue>"

It supports different backends, including Cython, which is relevant to the issue at hand. The function takes several parameters, but the ones of interest for this issue are `expr`, `args`, and `backend`. The `expr` parameter is the SymPy expression to be wrapped, `args` specifies the argument sequence for the function, and `backend` determines the code generation backend (e.g., Cython).\n\nFrom the provided code snippet, `autowrap` generates a wrapper around the given expression, handling auxiliary expressions through the `helpers` parameter if needed. It uses a `CodeWrapperClass` determined by the backend to wrap the generated code. The actual code generation is deferred to the `code_gen` object, which is responsible for creating the routine (`code_gen.routine('autofunc', expr, args)`) that will be wrapped.\n\n### MatrixSymbol Class Analysis\nThe `MatrixSymbol` class, found in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, represents a symbolic matrix. This class is used to create matrix symbols that can be part of expressions passed to `autowrap`. The class has properties like `shape` and `name`, and methods that handle symbolic operations on matrices. For the issue at hand, the key aspect of `MatrixSymbol` is that it allows for matrix expressions to be used as arguments in expressions passed to `autowrap`.\n\n### Issue Analysis\nThe issue arises when a `MatrixSymbol` is used as an argument in an expression passed to `autowrap`, but the final expression does not actually depend on the matrix symbol. In such cases, the generated C function has an incorrect signature, treating the matrix argument as a scalar (`double`) instead of a pointer to a double (`double *`), leading to a `TypeError` when the function is called with a numpy array.\n\n### Potential Solution Path\nTo address this issue, we need to modify the code generation logic to correctly handle cases where matrix arguments are present but not used in the final expression. This likely involves changes in how `code_gen.routine` determines the argument types for the generated C function. Specifically, we need to ensure that if an argument is a `MatrixSymbol`, it is treated as an array (pointer) in the generated C code, regardless of its usage in the expression.\n\nThe next steps would involve:\n1. Investigating how `code_gen.routine` determines argument types for the generated C function. This might require searching for the implementation of `routine` method in the code generation classes.\n2. Modifying the logic to correctly handle unused `MatrixSymbol` arguments as arrays in the generated C code.\n\nGiven the current context, a deeper dive into the `code_gen` object and its `routine` method is necessary to propose a specific patch."
