Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that a direct and specific solution to the issue described cannot be provided without further context or access to the relevant parts of the Django framework that handle `empty_form` instantiation and rendering. The initial approach and the speculative patch provided do not directly address the issue due to the lack of visibility into the exact mechanisms by which `empty_form` is affected by `empty_permitted` within the formset's implementation.

In a real-world scenario, resolving such an issue would involve a detailed review of the Django source code, particularly the parts that handle formsets and form rendering. Since the direct approach of modifying `kwargs` did not resolve the issue and without the ability to directly inspect and modify the relevant Django source code, the best course of action would be to consult Django's official documentation, source code comments, and possibly the Django developer community for insights into the intended behavior and implementation details of `empty_form` and `form_kwargs`.

### Recommended Steps for Resolution
1. **Review Django Documentation:** Specifically, the documentation for formsets, `BaseModelFormSet`, and form rendering to understand the intended use and behavior of `empty_form` and how `form_kwargs` should be handled.

2. **Inspect Django Source Code:** Look into the Django source code for formsets (`BaseModelFormSet` and related classes) to understand how `empty_form` is instantiated and rendered. This would help identify where `empty_permitted` could be causing the issue.

3. **Engage with Django Community:** If the documentation and source code review do not yield a clear solution, engaging with the Django developer community through forums, mailing lists, or issue trackers could provide additional insights or known workarounds for the issue.

4. **Consider Alternative Approaches:** If `empty_permitted` is causing issues specifically with `empty_form` and no direct solution is apparent, consider whether there are alternative approaches to achieving the desired functionality without explicitly setting `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs`, or if there's a way to conditionally handle `empty_permitted` based on the form being instantiated.

### Conclusion
Without the ability to directly apply a patch to the Django framework's handling of `empty_form` and `empty_permitted`, and given the limitations of this interaction model, the issue requires a more in-depth investigation that goes beyond the scope of this format. The steps recommended above provide a pathway to finding a resolution through additional research and community engagement.
