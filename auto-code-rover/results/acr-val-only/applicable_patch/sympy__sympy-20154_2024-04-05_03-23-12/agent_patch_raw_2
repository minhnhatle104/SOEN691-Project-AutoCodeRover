Given the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach to resolving the issue. The primary goal is to ensure that each partition dictionary yielded by the `partitions` function is a distinct object, to prevent the unexpected behavior described in the issue. Let's revise the patch with a focus on ensuring that a new dictionary is created and yielded in each iteration where it's necessary. This means adjusting the logic within the loop that generates partitions to ensure that a copy of the dictionary is made each time a partition is yielded.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/utilities/iterables.py</file>
<original>if size:
    yield sum(ms.values()), ms
else:
    yield ms</original>
<patched>if size:
    # Ensure a copy of the dictionary is made to avoid reusing the same object
    yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
else:
    # Ensure a copy of the dictionary is made to avoid reusing the same object
    yield ms.copy()</patched>
```

This modification ensures that each time a partition is yielded, whether it includes the size or not, a copy of the current state of the `ms` dictionary is made. This approach addresses the core issue by preventing the reuse of the same dictionary object across multiple yields, which was leading to the confusing behavior and potential bugs as described in the issue.

The previous attempt mistakenly included modifications for cases where static or trivially new dictionaries were yielded (`{0: 1}` and `{}`). These cases do not contribute to the issue described, as they inherently yield new dictionary objects each time. The focus should solely be on the part of the code where the `ms` dictionary, which is actively modified throughout the function, is yielded.
