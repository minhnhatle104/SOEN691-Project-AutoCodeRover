Given the information provided, the following API calls could help us gather more context:\n\n1. Search for any class or method that might be responsible for handling table numbering or the `numref` directive. Since the issue doesn't specify any particular class or method names, we'll start with a broad search related to `numref` and table numbering logic:\n   - `search_method(\"numref\")`\n   - `search_code(\"no number is assigned for table\")`\n\n2. If the warning is specifically related to the `singlehtml` or `latex` builders, it might be useful to look into any methods or classes that are specifically tied to these builders to see if any changes related to table numbering or `numref` handling were introduced in Sphinx 3.3:\n   - `search_class(\"SingleHTMLBuilder\")`\n   - `search_class(\"LaTeXBuilder\")`\n\nThese searches aim to identify the parts of the codebase that could be responsible for the issue, allowing us to further investigate and potentially patch the problem."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some insights into the issue and the context in which it occurs:\n\n1. **No Direct References to `numref` or the Warning Message**: The search for a method named `numref` and the specific warning message \"no number is assigned for table\" yielded no results. This suggests that the warning might not be directly tied to a method or code snippet explicitly named after `numref` or the warning message itself. It's possible that the logic triggering this warning is more indirectly related or is part of a larger system within Sphinx that handles document elements and references.\n\n2. **LaTeXBuilder Class**: The search for classes related to the `singlehtml` and `latex` builders found the `LaTeXBuilder` class but not a `SingleHTMLBuilder`. This could indicate that the issue might be more closely related to the LaTeX part of Sphinx or that the `SingleHTMLBuilder` is either named differently or is part of a different mechanism not directly exposed in the class names. The `LaTeXBuilder` class has several methods that could potentially influence how tables are handled or numbered, but without a direct reference to the issue at hand, pinpointing the exact method requires further analysis.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps in analyzing the issue could involve:\n- Investigating how the `LaTeXBuilder` class handles document elements, particularly tables, and whether it interacts with numbering or referencing mechanisms that could lead to the warning.\n- Considering the broader context of how Sphinx handles document building and references across different builders, given that the issue also affects `singlehtml` builds. This might involve looking into shared utilities or base classes that both the `LaTeXBuilder` and the mechanism behind `singlehtml` builds rely on.\n- Reviewing recent changes to Sphinx, especially around version 3.3, that might have affected table numbering or the `numref` system indirectly. This could involve looking at commit logs, issue trackers, or release notes for Sphinx.\n\nWithout direct leads from the initial searches, the issue likely requires a more nuanced understanding of Sphinx's internal mechanisms for document building and reference handling. Further investigation into how Sphinx versions prior to 3.3 handled these aspects compared to version 3.3 could also shed light on the source of the warning."
