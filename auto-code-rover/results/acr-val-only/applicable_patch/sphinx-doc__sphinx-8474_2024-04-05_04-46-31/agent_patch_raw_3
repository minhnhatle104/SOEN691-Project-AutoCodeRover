Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that creating a direct and effective patch to resolve the issue without specific details on the mechanism generating the "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" message is challenging. The provided code snippets and the nature of the issue suggest that the problem lies in a more complex interaction within the Sphinx documentation generation process, particularly related to the LaTeX output, which was not directly illuminated by the snippets.

Without explicit references to the handling of `numref` or table numbering in the provided code, and given the failure of the hypothetical patches to resolve the issue, it's evident that a different approach or additional information is necessary to accurately address the problem.

In real-world scenarios, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing Documentation and Community Resources**: Often, issues like these have been encountered and discussed by other users. The Sphinx documentation, GitHub issues, and forums like Stack Overflow can provide insights or solutions.

2. **Debugging and Tracing**: By running Sphinx in a debug mode or adding custom logging around the areas where tables are processed for LaTeX output, one might identify where the process fails to assign numbers to tables.

3. **Consulting with Sphinx Developers**: For issues that are deeply rooted in the tool's internals, reaching out to the Sphinx developer community or contributing developers might provide the most direct path to a resolution.

Given the limitations in providing a direct patch without further context, this scenario underscores the importance of comprehensive debugging, community engagement, and possibly, deeper involvement with the Sphinx project to contribute a fix.
