            "content": "- do we need more context: \nGiven the current information and the lack of direct leads, it would be beneficial to gather more context about how Sphinx handles table numbering and references across its different builders. Specifically, understanding the mechanisms that could potentially interact with the LaTeX builder or the document building process in general might help. Therefore, the following search API calls could provide more context:\n\n1. Investigate if there's a base class or common utility methods for builders that might affect table numbering:\n   - `search_class(\"Builder\")`\n\n2. Since the issue might be related to how references or numbers are assigned to tables, searching for methods that handle document elements and their numbering could be insightful:\n   - `search_method(\"assign_numbers\")`\n   - `search_code(\"table numbering\")`\n\n3. Given that the issue also affects `singlehtml`, understanding how Sphinx handles document conversion to single HTML might reveal shared logic with the LaTeX builder:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"build_singlehtml\", \"sphinx/builders/__init__.py\")`\n\nThese searches aim to uncover more about the underlying mechanisms that could be responsible for the warning, focusing on document building, element numbering, and the potential shared logic between different builders.\n\n- where are bug locations: \nCurrently, we do not have enough specific information to pinpoint the exact bug locations. The only concrete lead we have is the `LaTeXBuilder` class located in `sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py`, but without knowing how this class or its methods might be directly related to the issue, it's premature to label any part as definitively buggy. Further context from additional searches is needed to accurately identify bug locations."
