Given the information provided, the following API calls could help us gather more context:\n\n1. Search for any class or method that might be responsible for handling table numbering or the `numref` directive. Since the issue doesn't specify any particular class or method names, we'll start with a broad search related to `numref` and table numbering logic:\n   - `search_method(\"numref\")`\n   - `search_code(\"no number is assigned for table\")`\n\n2. If the warning is specifically related to the `singlehtml` or `latex` builders, it might be useful to look into any methods or classes that are specifically tied to these builders to see if any changes related to table numbering or `numref` handling were introduced in Sphinx 3.3:\n   - `search_class(\"SingleHTMLBuilder\")`\n   - `search_class(\"LaTeXBuilder\")`\n\nThese searches aim to identify the parts of the codebase that could be responsible for the issue, allowing us to further investigate and potentially patch the problem."
