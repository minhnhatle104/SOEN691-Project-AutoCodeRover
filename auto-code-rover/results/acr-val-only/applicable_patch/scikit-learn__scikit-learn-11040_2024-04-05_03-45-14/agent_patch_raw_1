These modifications ensure that `n_neighbors` is validated to be an integer as early as possible in the `kneighbors` method. This approach prevents the propagation of a float value that could cause a `TypeError` in deeper parts of the code, such as within the `NeighborsHeap` class, and provides a clear and informative error message to the user.
