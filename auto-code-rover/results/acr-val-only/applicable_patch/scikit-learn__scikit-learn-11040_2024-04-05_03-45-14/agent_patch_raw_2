Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach might have been too restrictive or incorrectly placed. Considering the need to also allow for the `n_neighbors` parameter to be a float that can be interpreted as an integer (e.g., 3.0), a revised approach would involve explicitly converting `n_neighbors` to an integer where necessary, rather than raising an error. This approach would maintain flexibility while ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/neighbors/base.py</file>
<original>if n_neighbors is None:
    n_neighbors = self.n_neighbors</original>
<patched>if n_neighbors is None:
    n_neighbors = self.n_neighbors
# Ensure n_neighbors is an integer
n_neighbors = int(n_neighbors)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/neighbors/base.py</file>
<original>if n_neighbors > train_size:
    raise ValueError(
        "Expected n_neighbors <= n_samples, "
        " but n_samples = %d, n_neighbors = %d" %
        (train_size, n_neighbors)
    )</original>
<patched># Ensure n_neighbors is an integer before this check
n_neighbors = int(n_neighbors)
if n_neighbors > train_size:
    raise ValueError(
        "Expected n_neighbors <= n_samples, "
        " but n_samples = %d, n_neighbors = %d" %
        (train_size, n_neighbors)
    )</patched>
```

This revised patch explicitly converts `n_neighbors` to an integer in the `kneighbors` method. This conversion is done after checking if `n_neighbors` is `None` and before it is used in any comparisons or operations that require it to be an integer. This approach should resolve the issue by ensuring that `n_neighbors` is always an appropriate type for the operations it's involved in, thus preventing the `TypeError` observed when a float is passed. Additionally, this method of casting to an integer is more lenient and user-friendly, as it automatically corrects float inputs that are effectively integers (e.g., 3.0) without requiring the user to make this correction manually.
