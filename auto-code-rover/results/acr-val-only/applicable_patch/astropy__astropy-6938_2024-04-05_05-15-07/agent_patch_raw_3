Given the constraints and the feedback received, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach to modify the contents of `output_field` directly. Since the direct assignment and iteration approaches have not resolved the issue, it's important to reconsider the nature of the operation and the data structure it's being applied to. Given `output_field` is likely a numpy array or a similar structure that doesn't support direct string replacement operations as intended, a different strategy is required.

However, based on the feedback that both proposed solutions did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, it appears there might be a fundamental misunderstanding of how to apply the fix within the constraints of the data structure (`output_field`) being manipulated. Without the ability to directly test and interact with the codebase or more detailed error messages from the test failures, providing an accurate and effective patch becomes challenging.

In real-world scenarios, the next steps would involve:

1. Reviewing the documentation or source code of the data structure of `output_field` to understand its capabilities and limitations regarding in-place modifications.
2. Investigating the test failures to identify why the proposed patches did not work as expected. This could provide insights into the nature of `output_field` and how it should be manipulated.
3. Considering alternative approaches to achieve the desired outcome, such as modifying the data structure to one that supports the required operations or applying the transformation at a different stage in the data processing pipeline.

Given the limitations of our current interaction, I cannot proceed further without additional context or the ability to perform more interactive debugging. In a practical setting, the steps outlined above would be essential to moving forward and finding a viable solution.
