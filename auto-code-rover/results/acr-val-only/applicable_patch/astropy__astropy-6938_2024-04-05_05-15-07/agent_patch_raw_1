# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py</file>
<original>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</original>
<patched>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field[:] = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the result of the `replace` operation is correctly assigned back to `output_field`. This is necessary because, as identified, the `replace` method does not modify the array in place but returns a new array with the replacements made. By assigning the result back to `output_field[:]`, we ensure that the modifications are applied to the original array.
