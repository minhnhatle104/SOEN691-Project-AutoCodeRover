Given the feedback, it seems the direct assignment approach `output_field[:] = ...` did not work as expected, possibly due to the nature of the data structure or the encoding method used. Considering `output_field` is likely a character array and the goal is to replace characters within each element of this array, we may need to iterate over the array and replace the content of each element individually. This approach ensures compatibility with various data structures and their in-place modification constraints.

```python
<file>astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py</file>
<original>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</original>
<patched>        if 'D' in format:
            for i in range(len(output_field)):
                output_field[i] = output_field[i].replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</patched>
```

This revised patch iterates over each element of `output_field` and applies the `replace` operation individually. This method should ensure that the replacement is effectively applied in-place for each element of the array, thus addressing the issue with the original approach.
