            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find where the text representation of `DatasetGroupBy` objects is defined in the codebase. This involves locating the method responsible for generating the string representation, which is typically `__str__` or `__repr__` in Python classes. Given that `DatasetGroupBy` is the class in question, we should start by searching for this class and then look for the method within it that generates its textual representation.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")`: This will help us locate the file and the exact location of the `DatasetGroupBy` class within the project.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`: Since the issue is related to the string representation, this will help us find if there's a custom `__str__` method in the `DatasetGroupBy` class that might be adding the trailing whitespace.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`: If the `__str__` method is not responsible or does not exist, the `__repr__` method might be the one generating the string representation, so we should check this as well."
