These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that transformers with no features to transform are handled correctly when setting the output column names for pandas DataFrames. The first modification filters out transformers that did not have any features to transform before attempting to set column names, preventing the "Length mismatch" error. The second modification adds a check to ensure that concatenation only occurs if there are names to concatenate, providing a fallback to an empty array if no transformers had features to transform. This approach maintains the intended functionality while ensuring robustness when dealing with edge cases.
