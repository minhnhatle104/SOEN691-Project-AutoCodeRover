Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's refine the approach. The main goals remain to enable `idiff` to handle `Eq` objects properly and to support differentiation with respect to functions like `f(x)` instead of just symbols like `y`. However, we need to ensure that the modifications do not break existing functionality and pass all tests.

Considering the original implementation and the issues reported, it seems that a more careful handling of `Eq` objects and function symbols is required. Let's revise the patch with a focus on compatibility and correctness.

# Revised Patch

## Modification 1: Handling `Eq` objects
We need to ensure that `Eq` objects are correctly converted into an expression that can be processed by the rest of the `idiff` function. This involves subtracting the right-hand side from the left-hand side of the equation.

```python
<file>sympy/geometry/util.py</file>
<original>if is_sequence(y):
    dep = set(y)
    y = y[0]
elif isinstance(y, Symbol):
    dep = {y}
else:
    raise ValueError("expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s" % y)</original>
<patched>if isinstance(eq, Eq):
    eq = eq.lhs - eq.rhs  # Convert Eq object to an expression

if is_sequence(y):
    dep = set(y)
    y = y[0]
elif isinstance(y, Symbol):
    dep = {y}
else:
    raise ValueError("expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s" % y)</patched>
```

## Modification 2: Supporting differentiation with respect to functions
The original approach to modifying the handling of `y` when it is a function (like `f(x)`) was not entirely correct. We need to ensure that `y` is treated appropriately throughout the function, especially when solving the differential equation.

```python
<file>sympy/geometry/util.py</file>
<original>elif isinstance(y, Symbol):
    dep = {y}
else:
    raise ValueError("expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s" % y)</original>
<patched>elif isinstance(y, Symbol):
    dep = {y}
elif isinstance(y, Function):
    dep = {y.args[0]}  # Assuming y is a function of a single variable
    y = y.func.__name__  # Use the function name as the dependent variable symbol
else:
    raise ValueError("expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s" % y)</patched>
```

Note: This revised approach assumes that when `y` is a function, it is always a function of a single variable, which is a reasonable assumption given the context of `idiff`. The patch now also correctly handles the conversion of function `y` into a symbol that represents the dependent variable, by using the function's name. This should address the issue without breaking existing functionality.
