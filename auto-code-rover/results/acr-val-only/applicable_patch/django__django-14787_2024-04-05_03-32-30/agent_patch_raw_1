```

This patch modifies the `method_decorator` function in `django/utils/decorators.py` to ensure that when a method is wrapped, it preserves the wrapper assignments such as `__name__`, `__module__`, and others defined in `WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS`. This is achieved by explicitly setting these attributes on the `_wrapper` if they exist on the original `method`. This change should address the issue where a `functools.partial` object does not have the expected function attributes, assuming that the partial object is created within the `_multi_decorate` function or similar.
