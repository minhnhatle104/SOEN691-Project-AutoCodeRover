Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's reconsider the approach. The core issue seems to be related to handling `functools.partial` objects which do not inherently have attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. The `method_decorator` should ideally ensure that these attributes are preserved or appropriately handled when dealing with partial objects. 

Since the initial approach of manually copying attributes did not solve the problem, a more robust solution might involve ensuring that the `update_wrapper` function from `functools` is used more effectively to copy all relevant attributes from the original function to the wrapper, including handling partial objects correctly.

```python
<file>django/utils/decorators.py</file>
<original>def method_decorator(decorator, name=''):
    ...
    if not hasattr(decorator, '__iter__'):
        update_wrapper(_dec, decorator)
    ...
    return _dec</original>
<patched>from functools import update_wrapper, partial, WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS

def method_decorator(decorator, name=''):
    ...
    def _dec(obj):
        ...
        _wrapper = _multi_decorate(decorator, method)
        # Check if the method is a partial object and update wrapper accordingly
        if isinstance(method, partial):
            update_wrapper(_wrapper, method.func)
            # Additionally copy attributes from the partial object itself, if any
            for attr in WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS:
                if hasattr(method, attr) and not hasattr(_wrapper, attr):
                    setattr(_wrapper, attr, getattr(method, attr))
        else:
            update_wrapper(_wrapper, method)
        setattr(obj, name, _wrapper)
        return obj
    ...
    if not hasattr(decorator, '__iter__'):
        update_wrapper(_dec, decorator, assigned=WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS)
    ...
    return _dec</patched>
```

This revised patch introduces a specific check for if the `method` is an instance of `functools.partial`. If so, it uses `update_wrapper` to copy the attributes from the `partial` object's underlying function (`method.func`) to the wrapper. Additionally, it attempts to copy any relevant attributes from the `partial` object itself that might not be present on the underlying function but are important for preserving the identity and behavior of the original method. This approach aims to ensure that the wrapper function correctly mimics the original method, including when that method is a partial object, thereby addressing the issue described.
