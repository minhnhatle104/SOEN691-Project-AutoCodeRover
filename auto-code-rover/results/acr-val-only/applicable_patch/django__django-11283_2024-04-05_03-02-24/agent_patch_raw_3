Given the constraints and the need for a solution that aligns closely with the original program structure while addressing the issue of unique constraint violations during the migration process, let's propose a refined patch. This patch will focus on preventing the unique constraint violation by ensuring that permission updates do not attempt to create duplicates, with a more careful approach to match the original program's structure and logic.

# modification 1 (Refined Approach)
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py</file>
<original>Permission.objects.filter(
            permissions_query,
            content_type=old_content_type,
        ).update(content_type=new_content_type)</original>
<patched># First, collect all permissions that need to be updated to avoid the unique constraint violation.
permissions_to_update = Permission.objects.filter(
    permissions_query,
    content_type=old_content_type,
)

# Iterate through each permission and update it individually, checking for potential duplicates.
for permission in permissions_to_update:
    if Permission.objects.filter(codename=permission.codename, content_type=new_content_type).exists():
        # If a permission with the same codename already exists for the new content type, skip the update.
        # Optionally, log this event or handle it as needed.
        print(f"Permission with codename '{permission.codename}' already exists for the new content type. Skipping update to prevent duplication.")
        continue
    # Update the content_type of the permission to the new content_type since no duplicate was found.
    permission.content_type = new_content_type
    permission.save()</patched>
```

This refined patch modifies the approach to updating permissions in the `update_proxy_model_permissions` function. Instead of attempting to bulk update all permissions and potentially triggering a unique constraint violation, it iterates through each permission that matches the criteria. Before performing the update, it checks if a permission with the same `codename` already exists for the `new_content_type`. If such a permission exists, the update is skipped for that particular permission to prevent duplication, and a message is logged (or other handling logic can be implemented as needed). This approach ensures that the migration can proceed without encountering unique constraint violations related to duplicate permissions.
