Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, a revised approach is necessary. The unique constraint violation suggests that the migration is trying to update permissions to a new `content_type` where permissions with the same `codename` already exist. A more robust solution would involve not only checking for existing permissions but also considering the possibility of merging or explicitly handling the permissions that would cause duplication. 

This revised approach will focus on enhancing the check for existing permissions and adding a mechanism to handle potential duplicates more gracefully. This might involve logging a warning or even deleting the old permissions if they are deemed redundant, depending on the specific requirements and safety considerations of the migration.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py</file>
<original>for permission in Permission.objects.filter(
            permissions_query,
            content_type=old_content_type,
        ):
    # Check if the permission with the new content type already exists.
    if not Permission.objects.filter(codename=permission.codename, content_type=new_content_type).exists():
        permission.content_type = new_content_type
        permission.save()
    else:
        # Log or handle the case where the permission update would create a duplicate.
        print(f"Skipping update for existing permission codename {permission.codename} to prevent duplicate.")</original>
<patched>from django.db import IntegrityError

for permission in Permission.objects.filter(
            permissions_query,
            content_type=old_content_type,
        ):
    try:
        # Attempt to update the permission's content type.
        permission.content_type = new_content_type
        permission.save()
    except IntegrityError:
        # If an IntegrityError is raised (e.g., due to a unique constraint violation), handle it.
        existing_permission = Permission.objects.filter(codename=permission.codename, content_type=new_content_type).first()
        if existing_permission:
            # If an existing permission is found, consider merging or deleting the old permission.
            # This example logs a message, but additional logic could be implemented as needed.
            print(f"Found existing permission with codename {permission.codename} for the new content type. Consider merging or explicitly handling this case.")
            # Example action: delete the old permission if it's safe to do so.
            # permission.delete()
</patched>
```

This revised modification introduces a try-except block to catch `IntegrityError` exceptions, which are raised in case of unique constraint violations. Upon catching such an error, it checks for the existence of a permission with the same `codename` for the `new_content_type`. If found, it logs a message indicating the situation. This is a safer approach that avoids directly modifying the database without a clear understanding of the implications. 

**Note**: The commented-out line `# permission.delete()` is a placeholder for a potential action, such as deleting the old permission. However, this action should be considered carefully and implemented only if it's certain that it won't negatively impact the system's integrity or permission model. Additional logic might be required to safely merge permissions or handle duplicates according to the specific needs of the application.
