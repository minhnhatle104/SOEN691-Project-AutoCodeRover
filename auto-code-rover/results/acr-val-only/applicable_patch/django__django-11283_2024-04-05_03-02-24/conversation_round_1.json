When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on \u200bdjango-users and was asked to report this here.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the results from the search API calls, let's analyze the collected context to understand the issue better and work towards a solution.\n\n1. **Migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` Not Found**: The search for the method `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` did not yield any results. This could mean that the migration is part of Django's internal migrations and not directly exposed or accessible through the project's codebase in a straightforward manner. This migration is likely part of the Django authentication system, specifically related to updating permissions for proxy models. Since we can't directly analyze this migration, we'll need to infer its intentions and effects based on the error message and the behavior described in the issue.\n\n2. **`ContentType` Class**: The `ContentType` model is found in `django/contrib/contenttypes/models.py`. This model is crucial for Django's content type framework, which allows permissions to be associated with models. The `ContentType` model includes fields like `app_label` and `model`, which uniquely identify a model in the Django project. The error message mentioned a violation of a unique constraint involving `content_type_id` and `codename`, suggesting that the migration attempts to create a permission that already exists for a given content type. Understanding how `ContentType` works is key to diagnosing issues related to permissions and content types.\n\n3. **Proxy Models Permissions**: The search for \"proxy models permissions\" led to a test case in `tests/admin_views/tests.py` named `AdminViewProxyModelPermissionsTests`, which suggests that there are specific tests for proxy model permissions in the admin. While this doesn't provide direct insight into the migration issue, it indicates that Django has a mechanism to handle permissions for proxy models, and there are tests to ensure this functionality works as expected.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from a conflict during the migration process where it attempts to create permissions for proxy models that already exist. This could be due to the migration not correctly identifying unique permissions for proxy models or not adequately handling the renaming or recreation of proxy models.\n\nTo move forward, we might need to look into how Django's migration system handles updates to permissions for proxy models and whether there are known issues or edge cases related to this. Since we can't directly access the migration code, we might also consider reviewing Django's issue tracker for similar issues or reaching out to the Django community for insights. Additionally, examining the implementation of the `ContentType` model and how it's used in relation to permissions could provide clues on how to prevent duplicate permission entries during migrations."
