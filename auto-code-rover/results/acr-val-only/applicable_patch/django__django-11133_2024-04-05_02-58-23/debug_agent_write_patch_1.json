        "content": "Based on the search result for the `HttpResponse` class in the `django/http/response.py` file, we have identified several key components and methods within the class that could be relevant to the issue at hand. Here's a breakdown of the findings and how they might relate to the problem:\n\n1. **Constructor `__init__(self, content=b'', *args, **kwargs)`**: This method initializes a new `HttpResponse` object. The `content` parameter is set to an empty byte string by default. This could be the first point where the handling of different content types, including `memoryview`, is relevant.\n\n2. **Property `content` and its setter `content(self, value)`**: This is likely the most relevant part of the class for the issue. The getter and setter for the `content` property manage how the content of the response is accessed and modified. The issue described involves an unexpected representation of `memoryview` objects when assigned to `content`, suggesting that the logic within the setter (or possibly the getter) does not properly handle `memoryview` objects.\n\n3. **Methods like `write(self, content)` and `writelines(self, lines)`**: These methods allow for content to be added to the response. While not directly implicated in the issue, understanding how they handle different content types could provide insights into how `memoryview` objects should be managed.\n\nGiven this context, the next step is to examine the implementation of the `content` property setter in the `HttpResponse` class. This will help us understand how it currently processes the assigned value and why it might not be handling `memoryview` objects as expected. Specifically, we need to see if there's a conversion or handling mechanism for different types of content and whether `memoryview` objects are considered.\n\nLet's proceed by looking into the implementation of the `content` setter method within the `HttpResponse` class:\n\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"def content(self, value):\", \"django/http/response.py\")`"
