Given the feedback and the need to revise the approach, let's consider an alternative solution that directly addresses the compatibility check within the `subplots_adjust` method without assuming additional methods like `get_constrained_layout()`. Instead, we can refine the compatibility check to more accurately determine when to issue the warning based on the actual usage of the constrained layout.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>        if (self.get_layout_engine() is not None and
                not self.get_layout_engine().adjust_compatible):
            _api.warn_external(
                "This figure was using a layout engine that is "
                "incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; "
                "not calling subplots_adjust.")
            return</original>
<patched>        layout_engine = self.get_layout_engine()
        if layout_engine is not None and hasattr(layout_engine, '_adjust_compatible') and
           not layout_engine._adjust_compatible:
            if hasattr(layout_engine, '_constrained') and not layout_engine._constrained:
                pass  # Proceed with subplots_adjust if constrained_layout is False
            else:
                _api.warn_external(
                    "This figure was using a layout engine that is "
                    "incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; "
                    "not calling subplots_adjust.")
                return</patched>
```

**Explanation**: This revised patch checks if the layout engine has an attribute `_adjust_compatible` and if it's set to `False`, indicating incompatibility with `subplots_adjust`. It then introduces an additional check for a hypothetical attribute `_constrained` on the layout engine, which would indicate whether `constrained_layout` is actively being used. If `_constrained` is `False`, it allows `subplots_adjust` to proceed, bypassing the warning and the early return. This approach assumes that the layout engine (e.g., `ConstrainedLayoutEngine`) could be extended with a `_constrained` attribute that accurately reflects the usage state of `constrained_layout`. If such an attribute does not exist, it would need to be implemented accordingly within the layout engine's initialization or configuration methods to reflect whether `constrained_layout` is enabled or not.

This solution aims to provide a more direct and accurate control over when the warning is issued, based on the actual state of `constrained_layout` usage, without assuming the existence of methods not previously identified in the provided context.
