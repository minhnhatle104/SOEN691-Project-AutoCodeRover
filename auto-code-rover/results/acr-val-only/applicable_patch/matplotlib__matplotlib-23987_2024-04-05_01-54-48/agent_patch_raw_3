Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that a direct approach to addressing the issue within the existing structure of the `subplots_adjust` method and the `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` class is necessary. Since the initial attempts to patch the issue were not successful, let's propose a solution that directly modifies the check within `subplots_adjust` to ensure it accurately reflects the intention behind `constrained_layout` usage without assuming additional methods or attributes.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>        if (self.get_layout_engine() is not None and
                not self.get_layout_engine().adjust_compatible):
            _api.warn_external(
                "This figure was using a layout engine that is "
                "incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; "
                "not calling subplots_adjust.")
            return</original>
<patched>        layout_engine = self.get_layout_engine()
        if layout_engine is not None:
            if isinstance(layout_engine, ConstrainedLayoutEngine) and not self.get_constrained_layout():
                pass  # Proceed with subplots_adjust if ConstrainedLayoutEngine is used but constrained_layout is False
            elif not layout_engine.adjust_compatible:
                _api.warn_external(
                    "This figure was using a layout engine that is "
                    "incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; "
                    "not calling subplots_adjust.")
                return</patched>
```

**Explanation**: This patch revises the compatibility check within the `subplots_adjust` method. It first retrieves the current layout engine and checks if it is an instance of `ConstrainedLayoutEngine`. If so, it then checks if `constrained_layout` is actually enabled for the figure. This is done by hypothetically using a method `get_constrained_layout()`, which should return the current state of `constrained_layout`. If `constrained_layout` is disabled (`False`), the method proceeds without issuing a warning or returning early, allowing `subplots_adjust` to execute as intended. 

For this patch to work as intended, it assumes the existence of a `get_constrained_layout()` method within the figure class that accurately returns whether `constrained_layout` is enabled. If such a method does not exist, an alternative approach would be needed to check the `constrained_layout` state directly, possibly by accessing a relevant attribute or configuration setting within the figure or layout engine.

This solution aims to address the issue by ensuring that the warning is only issued when `constrained_layout` is actively in use and incompatible with `subplots_adjust`, thereby avoiding the problem of the warning appearing even when `constrained_layout` is disabled.
