**Explanation**: The patch adds an additional condition to check if `constrained_layout` is actually enabled (`self.get_constrained_layout()`) before deciding to issue a warning and skip the `subplots_adjust` call. This ensures that the warning is only issued when `constrained_layout` is enabled, addressing the issue where the warning was incorrectly triggered even when `constrained_layout` was set to `False`. Note that this assumes the existence of a method `get_constrained_layout()` in the `Figure` class that returns the current state of `constrained_layout`. If such a method does not exist, it would need to be implemented based on how `constrained_layout` is stored and managed within the `Figure` class.
