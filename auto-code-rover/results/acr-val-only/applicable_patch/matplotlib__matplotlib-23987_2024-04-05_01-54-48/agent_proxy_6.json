This property indicates that the `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` does not support adjustments made through methods like `subplots_adjust` or `tight_layout`, leading to the warning when such methods are attempted.\n\n2. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`\n   - **Method**: `FigureBase.subplots_adjust`\n     - This method contains the compatibility check that triggers the warning if the current layout engine (in cases where `constrained_layout` is used, this would be an instance of `ConstrainedLayoutEngine`) is marked as incompatible. The method's logic that issues a warning, despite `constrained_layout` being set to `False`, is central to the reported issue.\n\nThese identified locations are where the logic related to the issue resides, making them key targets for modifications or further investigation to resolve the problem."
