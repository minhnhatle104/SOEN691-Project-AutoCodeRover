This patch introduces a `kind` property to the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py`. It checks if the expression (`self.expr`) the derivative is taken of is an instance of `MatrixExpr`. If it is, the `kind` property returns `MatrixKind`, indicating that the derivative is of a matrix expression. Otherwise, it returns `UndefinedKind`, which is the current behavior. This approach aligns with how the `kind` property is expected to behave based on the issue description, ensuring consistency with the handling of the `kind` attribute in other parts of the SymPy library.
