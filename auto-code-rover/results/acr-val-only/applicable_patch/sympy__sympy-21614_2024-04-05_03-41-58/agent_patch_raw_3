Given the constraints and the feedback, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the approach to directly modify the internal behavior of the `Derivative` class, especially without clear guidance on where and how the `kind` property is managed across different types of expressions in SymPy. Since the direct approach to introduce a `kind` method or modify the `_eval_derivative` method did not align with the program's structure and expectations, and considering the limitations in applying the patch directly, a more fitting solution cannot be provided without further insights into the SymPy library's architecture regarding the handling of kinds for mathematical expressions.

In the context of SymPy, the handling of kinds, especially for complex expressions like derivatives of matrix symbols, involves a nuanced understanding of the library's type system and the propagation of kinds through operations. The correct approach would likely involve a deeper integration with the existing kind system, ensuring that the derivative of a matrix symbol correctly infers its kind based on the symbol's kind and the operation being performed.

Without the ability to directly inspect and modify the library's source code or run tests to validate the approach, providing a specific patch to resolve the issue as described is not feasible. The resolution would require access to the library's implementation details regarding kind inference and the ability to test changes to ensure they correctly address the issue without introducing regressions or inconsistencies in kind handling across the library.
