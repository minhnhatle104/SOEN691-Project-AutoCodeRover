Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem might be related to handling single-dimension variables during the unstacking process. However, without a clear indication of a specific bug or a detailed understanding of the internal workings and dependencies of the xarray library, proposing an exact patch is challenging. Still, I can suggest a conceptual approach that could be explored further by developers familiar with the xarray codebase.

The issue appears during the `to_unstacked_dataset` process, where a `MergeError` is raised due to conflicting values for a variable. This might happen if the method does not correctly handle cases where variables have been stacked from a single dimension and then are attempted to be unstacked back to their original form.

A conceptual patch could involve ensuring that during the unstacking process, the method correctly identifies and handles variables that originated from a single dimension, avoiding conflicts that lead to a `MergeError`. This might involve checking the dimensions of variables during the unstacking process and applying special handling for single-dimension cases.

# modification 1
```python
<file>xarray/core/dataarray.py</file>
<original>if not isinstance(idx, pd.MultiIndex):
    raise ValueError(f"'{dim}' is not a stacked coordinate")</original>
<patched>if not isinstance(idx, pd.MultiIndex):
    # If the dimension is not a MultiIndex, it might be a single-dimension variable that was stacked.
    # In such cases, directly reconstruct the dataset from the DataArray without unstacking.
    if dim in self.dims:
        return self.to_dataset(name=dim)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"'{dim}' is not a stacked coordinate and does not match any existing dimension.")</patched>
```

This modification attempts to handle cases where the dimension to be unstacked is not a `MultiIndex`, which might indicate a single-dimension variable. Instead of raising a `ValueError` immediately, it checks if the dimension exists in the `DataArray` and tries to convert it directly into a `Dataset`. This is a conceptual approach and might need adjustments based on the internal logic and data structures of xarray.

Please note, this patch is speculative and intended as a starting point for further investigation by the xarray development team. It is essential to thoroughly test any changes to ensure they correctly address the issue without introducing new bugs.
