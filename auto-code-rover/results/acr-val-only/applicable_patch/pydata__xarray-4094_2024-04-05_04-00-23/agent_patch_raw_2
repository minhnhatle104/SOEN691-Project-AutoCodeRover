Given the complexity of the issue and without direct access to run and test the code within the xarray library, providing a precise patch is challenging. However, I can offer a more conceptual approach to address the issue based on the information provided and the typical patterns of problems in such scenarios.

The error seems to stem from the handling of dimensions and coordinates during the unstacking process, particularly for variables with a single dimension. A potential solution could involve ensuring that the unstacking process correctly reconstructs the original dimensions and coordinates of such variables.

Since the direct approach in the previous attempt was speculative and not successful, let's consider a more nuanced approach focusing on ensuring the integrity of dimensions and coordinates during the unstacking process.

# Conceptual Patch:

The conceptual approach involves adding checks and logic to handle single-dimension variables more gracefully during the unstacking process. This would likely involve modifications in the `to_unstacked_dataset` method to detect when a variable that was stacked (and thus has a MultiIndex) can be safely unstacked back to its original single-dimension form without causing conflicts.

```python
<file>xarray/core/dataarray.py</file>
<original>level_number = idx._get_level_number(level)
variables = idx.levels[level_number]
variable_dim = idx.names[level_number]

# pull variables out of datarray
data_dict = {}
for k in variables:
    data_dict[k] = self.sel({variable_dim: k}).squeeze(drop=True)</original>
<patched># Before attempting to unstack, check if the operation will result in single-dimension variables
try:
    level_number = idx._get_level_number(level)
    variables = idx.levels[level_number]
    variable_dim = idx.names[level_number]

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the unstacked variables
    data_dict = {}

    for k in variables:
        # Select the data for each variable and attempt to drop the level used for stacking
        selected_data = self.sel({variable_dim: k})
        
        # If the resulting selection has more than one dimension, squeeze to drop the level
        # Otherwise, retain the original dimensions to avoid collapsing to a scalar
        if len(selected_data.dims) > 1:
            data_dict[k] = selected_data.squeeze(drop=True)
        else:
            data_dict[k] = selected_data
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle cases where unstacking is not straightforward due to dimensionality issues
    raise ValueError("Error during unstacking: {}".format(e))</patched>
```

This conceptual patch introduces a try-except block to catch potential issues during the unstacking process. It also adds logic to handle the selection and squeezing of data more carefully, aiming to preserve the original dimensions of variables where possible. This approach is designed to mitigate issues related to dimensionality conflicts, particularly for variables that were originally single-dimensional.

Please note, this patch is still conceptual and would need to be adapted to fit the exact data structures and logic of the xarray library. It's crucial to thoroughly test any changes to ensure they address the issue without introducing new problems.
