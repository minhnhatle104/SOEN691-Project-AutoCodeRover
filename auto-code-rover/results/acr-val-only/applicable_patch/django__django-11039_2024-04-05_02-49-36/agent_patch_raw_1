        # Show begin/end around output for atomic migrations and if the database supports transactional DDL
        self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl

```

This patch modifies the `sqlmigrate` command to ensure that the output is wrapped in `BEGIN/COMMIT` only if the migration is atomic **and** the database supports transactional DDL. This is achieved by also checking the `can_rollback_ddl` feature of the database connection in addition to the `migration.atomic` attribute. This approach aligns with the issue's description and addresses the problem of wrapping the output in transactions for databases that do not support transactional DDL.
