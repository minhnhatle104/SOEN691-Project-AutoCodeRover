        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, we can start analyzing the relevant parts of the Django codebase to understand how to address the issue described in the submitted bug report. The issue is that `makemigrations` does not check if the fields named in `UniqueConstraint` actually exist, unlike the older `unique_together` syntax, which raises `models.E012` if the fields don't exist.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **`makemigrations` Method**: The search for `makemigrations` did not yield direct results, which suggests that the logic for handling migrations, including the processing of constraints, might be spread across multiple modules and classes rather than being encapsulated in a single method named `makemigrations`. This means we'll need to focus on the parts of the codebase that deal with model validation and migration autodetection.\n\n2. **`unique_together` Usage**: The search for `unique_together` returned numerous results across various files, with significant matches in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `tests/schema/tests.py`. This indicates that the validation for `unique_together` is likely implemented in these areas, particularly in model and migration-related code. The `autodetector.py` file seems especially relevant for understanding how Django detects and handles unique constraints during the migration generation process.\n\n3. **`UniqueConstraint` Class**: The `UniqueConstraint` class is defined in `django/db/models/constraints.py`. The class methods suggest that it has the capability to generate SQL for creating and removing constraints, among other things. However, there's no direct indication of field existence validation in the provided class methods snippet. This means the validation logic might need to be implemented or extended to include checks for field existence.\n\n4. **`models.E012` Error**: The search for `models.E012` showed that this error code is used in `django/db/models/base.py` and in tests under `tests/invalid_models_tests/test_models.py`. This suggests that the implementation for raising this error for `unique_together` constraints is likely in `base.py`, and the mechanism could potentially be adapted or extended to handle `UniqueConstraint` validations.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n\n- **Reviewing `autodetector.py`**: To understand how `unique_together` constraints are detected and validated during the migration generation process. This could provide insights into where and how to implement similar validation for `UniqueConstraint`.\n\n- **Examining `base.py`**: Since this file is involved in raising `models.E012`, it's likely a good place to start looking for existing field validation logic that could be adapted for `UniqueConstraint`.\n\n- **Extending `UniqueConstraint` Validation**: Based on the understanding gained from the above steps, the `UniqueConstraint` class or the process that handles it during migrations might need to be extended to include validation for the existence of specified fields.\n\nThis approach should provide a pathway towards implementing a solution for the reported issue."

        "content": "With the additional context provided by the search results, we can refine our understanding of where and how the issue with `UniqueConstraint` field validation might be addressed within the Django codebase.\n\n### Analysis of New Context\n\n1. **`validate_unique_together` Method**:\n   - The search for `validate_unique_together` in `django/db/models/base.py` did not find any results. This indicates that the validation for `unique_together` might not be encapsulated in a method with this exact name, or it's handled differently than initially anticipated.\n\n2. **Usage of `unique_together` in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`**:\n   - The `unique_together` snippets found in `autodetector.py` are spread across several methods, including `_detect_changes`, `check_dependency`, `generate_created_models`, `generate_deleted_models`, `_generate_removed_field`, and `generate_altered_unique_together`. This distribution suggests that `unique_together` is considered at various stages of the migration detection and generation process, from detecting changes in models to generating the actual migration files.\n   - The presence of a method named `generate_altered_unique_together` specifically points to the mechanism for handling changes to `unique_together` constraints. This could serve as a model for implementing similar handling for `UniqueConstraint`.\n\n3. **`models.E012` in `django/db/models/base.py`**:\n   - The snippet found in `_check_local_fields` method under the `Model` class in `base.py` indicates that `models.E012` is raised as part of the local field checks in a model. This suggests that the validation for field existence in relation to `unique_together` is integrated into broader model validation logic.\n   - This approach to validation could potentially be adapted or extended to include checks for the fields specified in `UniqueConstraint`.\n\n### Conclusions\n\n- **Where to Implement `UniqueConstraint` Field Checks**:\n  - Given the structure of the validation for `unique_together` and the handling of `models.E012`, it seems appropriate to integrate the field existence checks for `UniqueConstraint` within the model validation process, similar to how `unique_together` fields are validated. Specifically, extending the `_check_local_fields` method or a similar validation point in `django/db/models/base.py` could be a viable approach.\n  - Additionally, considering how `unique_together` is handled in `autodetector.py`, especially in methods like `generate_altered_unique_together`, it might be necessary to ensure that `UniqueConstraint` changes are correctly detected and processed during migration generation. This could involve extending existing methods or adding new ones to handle `UniqueConstraint` specifically.\n\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - The next step would involve drafting a patch that extends the model validation logic to include checks for the existence of fields specified in `UniqueConstraint`. This would likely involve modifications to `django/db/models/base.py`, particularly within the model validation methods.\n  - Another aspect of the solution would involve ensuring that `UniqueConstraint` changes are correctly detected and processed in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, potentially by adapting the logic used for `unique_together`.\n\nThis analysis provides a clearer direction for addressing the issue, focusing on integrating field existence checks for `UniqueConstraint` into the model validation process and ensuring correct handling during migration generation."
