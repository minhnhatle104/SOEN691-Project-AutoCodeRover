These modifications aim to address the issue with single-element tuples not being correctly recognized due to the absence of a trailing comma in the generated Python code. By introducing a `_print_Tuple` method in `PythonCodePrinter`, we ensure that tuples are formatted correctly, including adding a trailing comma for single-element tuples. The second modification doesn't change the code in `lambdify.py` directly but highlights that the changes in `PythonCodePrinter` will ensure tuples are handled correctly in the generated code by `lambdify`.
