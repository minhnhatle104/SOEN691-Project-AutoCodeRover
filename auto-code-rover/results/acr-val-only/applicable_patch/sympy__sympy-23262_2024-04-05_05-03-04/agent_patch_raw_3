Given the constraints and the need to address the issue with the handling of single-element tuples in the Python code generated by SymPy's `lambdify` function, a more precise approach is required. Considering the feedback, let's refine the patch to ensure compatibility and address the core issue effectively.

    def _print_Tuple(self, expr):
        """
        Handle printing of tuples in Python code, ensuring single-element tuples
        are correctly formatted with a trailing comma.
        """
        elements = list(expr)
        if len(elements) == 1:
            # For single-element tuples, add a comma to ensure it's recognized as a tuple
            return "({},)".format(self._print(elements[0]))
        else:
            return "({})".format(", ".join(self._print(element) for element in elements))
</patched>
```

Given the initial attempt did not resolve the issue due to potential mismatches or inaccuracies in addressing the specific problem, the refined patch still focuses on adding a `_print_Tuple` method to `PythonCodePrinter`. This method is crucial for ensuring that tuples, especially those with a single element, are formatted correctly in the generated Python code, adhering to Python's syntax requirements for tuples.

This modification directly introduces a method to handle tuple expressions, which was identified as a missing piece in the puzzle for generating syntactically correct Python code for tuples. By explicitly formatting single-element tuples with a trailing comma, this approach aims to rectify the issue where such tuples were previously misinterpreted as mere parentheses surrounding an expression, rather than as tuples.

Please ensure that this patch is applied in the context of the `PythonCodePrinter` class within the `sympy/printing/pycode.py` file, as it directly modifies the class definition to include the new `_print_Tuple` method. This method should correctly handle the conversion of tuple expressions into their appropriate Python code representation, thereby resolving the issue reported with `lambdify`'s handling of single-element tuples.
