The issue suggests that the behavior changed in SymPy 1.10, affecting the output format for single-element tuples. \n\nGiven this information, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"lambdify\")`: This will help in understanding how `lambdify` is implemented and might give insights into any changes made in the recent version that could have led to this issue.\n\n2. `search_code(\"return (1,)\")`: Searching for the correct tuple syntax in the codebase might help identify where the Python code printer is handling tuple outputs and if there's a specific condition for single-element tuples that was altered or is missing in the latest version.\n\n3. `search_code(\"return (1)\")`: This will help in identifying where the incorrect tuple syntax without a comma is being generated, which seems to be the root cause of the issue reported."
