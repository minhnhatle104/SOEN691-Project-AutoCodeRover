        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Based on the collected context, we can deduce the following key points relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Implementation of `pytest.raises`**:\n   - The `raises` function is defined in `src/_pytest/python_api.py`. It is designed to assert that a code block or function call raises an expected exception. If the expected exception is not raised, it fails the test.\n   - The `raises` function can be used both as a context manager and in a legacy form where a callable is specified.\n   - When used as a context manager, `raises` returns an `ExceptionInfo` object which can be used to inspect the details of the captured exception. This is likely where the discrepancy in behavior noted in the issue arises.\n\n2. **`RaisesContext` Class**:\n   - Also located in `src/_pytest/python_api.py`, this class seems to be the context manager returned by the `raises` function. It has methods `__enter__` and `__exit__`, which are standard for Python context managers.\n   - The issue likely stems from how the `RaisesContext` class handles the exception and what is returned or accessible when calling `str()` on the context variable.\n\n3. **Usage of `pytest.raises` in the Codebase**:\n   - There are numerous instances of `with pytest.raises` across various test files in the codebase, indicating that this pattern is widely used and any changes to its behavior need to be carefully considered to avoid breaking existing tests.\n\nGiven these points, the core of the issue seems to be the difference in behavior between how exceptions are represented when caught using a try-except block versus when captured using the `pytest.raises` context manager. Specifically, the user expects that calling `str()` on the context variable returned by `pytest.raises` would yield the full exception message, similar to the behavior observed with a caught exception in a try-except block. However, currently, one must access `e.value` to get the full exception message when using `pytest.raises`.\n\nTo address this issue, we would need to look into modifying the `RaisesContext` class to alter how the exception message is represented or accessed, ensuring that it aligns more closely with the standard Python exception handling behavior. This might involve adjusting how the exception is stored within the context manager or overriding the `__str__` method of the `RaisesContext` class to return the full exception message directly, rather than requiring access through `e.value`."

This has been deprecated as it\n        is considered error prone as users often mean to use ``match`` instead.\n        See :ref:`the deprecation docs <raises message deprecated>` for a workaround.\n\n    .. note::\n\n       When using ``pytest.raises`` as a context manager, it's worthwhile to\n       note that normal context manager rules apply and that the exception\n       raised *must* be the final line in the scope of the context manager.\n       Lines of code after that, within the scope of the context manager will\n       not be executed. For example::\n\n           >>> value = 15\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError(\"value must be <= 10\")\n           ...     assert exc_info.type is ValueError  # this will not execute\n\n       Instead, the following approach must be taken (note the difference in\n       scope)::\n\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError(\"value must be <= 10\")\n           ...\n           >>> assert exc_info.type is ValueError\n\n    **Using with** ``pytest.mark.parametrize``\n\n    When using :ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize ref`\n    it is possible to parametrize tests such that\n    some runs raise an exception and others do not.\n\n    See :ref:`parametrizing_conditional_raising` for an example.\n\n    **Legacy form**\n\n    It is possible to specify a callable by passing a to-be-called lambda::\n\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, lambda: 1/0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    or you can specify an arbitrary callable with arguments::\n\n        >>> def f(x): return 1/x\n        ...\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, 0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, x=0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    The form above is fully supported but discouraged for new code because the\n    context manager form is regarded as more readable and less error-prone.\n\n    .. note::\n        Similar to caught exception objects in Python, explicitly clearing\n        local references to returned ``ExceptionInfo`` objects can\n        help the Python interpreter speed up its garbage collection.\n\n        Clearing those references breaks a reference cycle\n        (``ExceptionInfo`` --> caught exception --> frame stack raising\n        the exception --> current frame stack --> local variables -->\n        ``ExceptionInfo``) which makes Python keep all objects referenced\n        from that cycle (including all local variables in the current\n        frame) alive until the next cyclic garbage collection run.

The goal is to ensure that users can access the full exception message directly through the `RaisesContext` instance in a way that is intuitive and consistent with Python's standard exception handling.

This allows users to easily access the exception and its message without changing the fundamental return behavior of the `__enter__` method. The `__str__` method is also adjusted to check if `self.excinfo` and `self.excinfo.value` are not `None` before attempting to return the string representation of the exception, ensuring that it gracefully handles cases where no exception is captured. This approach aims to provide a more intuitive way for users to access the full exception message while maintaining backward compatibility and not altering the core behavior of the `RaisesContext`."

The expectation to use `str(e)` directly on the context manager's return value to get the full exception message, while intuitive from a Python standard usage perspective, does not align with the design and usage patterns encouraged by pytest for interacting with captured exceptions.\n\nTherefore, without a specific code modification that can address the issue without causing test failures or fundamentally changing the intended usage patterns of pytest, the best course of action might be to enhance documentation or provide clear examples on how to properly access the full exception message when using `pytest.raises`. This approach ensures that users are well-informed about the intended usage patterns and how to achieve their goals without necessitating changes to the codebase that could have unintended side effects.\n\nIn summary, based on the limitations encountered with direct code modifications and the importance of maintaining pytest's existing behavior and compatibility, focusing on user education and documentation might be the most effective resolution for the issue described."
