# modification 2
```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>        hooks = hooks or {}

        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)</original>
<patched>        hooks = hooks or {}

        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)  # No change needed here due to the updated register_hook method handling both cases.</patched>
```
The second modification indicates that no change is needed in the `__init__` method for handling the `hooks` parameter, as the updated `register_hook` method now correctly handles both single hooks and lists of hooks.
