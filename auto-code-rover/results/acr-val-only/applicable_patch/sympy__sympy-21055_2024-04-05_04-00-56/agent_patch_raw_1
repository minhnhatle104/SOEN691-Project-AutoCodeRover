These modifications aim to enhance the `refine` function's handling of `Piecewise` expressions by explicitly refining both the conditions and expressions within `Piecewise` objects based on the provided assumptions. Additionally, it ensures that conditions within `Piecewise` expressions are simplified based on assumptions during the evaluation process, potentially resolving the issue where `refine()` does not simplify complex arguments effectively.
