Given the feedback, it seems there was an oversight in the initial patch. Let's revise the approach considering the structure of the `eval` method and how SymPy typically handles symbolic limits and infinite values. A more nuanced approach might be required to ensure compatibility with the rest of the SymPy library and to pass all tests.

        if n.is_Integer and n.is_nonnegative:
            if k_sym is None:
                return Integer(cls._bell(int(n)))
            elif symbols is None:
                return cls._bell_poly(int(n)).subs(_sym, k_sym)
            else:
                r = cls._bell_incomplete_poly(int(n), int(k_sym), symbols)
                return r
</original>
<patched>    def eval(cls, n, k_sym=None, symbols=None):
        if n.is_infinite:
            if n == S.Infinity:
                return S.Infinity
            else:
                raise ValueError("The Bell number is not defined for negative infinity.")
        if n.is_Integer and n.is_nonnegative:
            if k_sym is None:
                return Integer(cls._bell(int(n)))
            elif symbols is None:
                return cls._bell_poly(int(n)).subs(_sym, k_sym)
            else:
                r = cls._bell_incomplete_poly(int(n), int(k_sym), symbols)
                return r
</patched>
```

This revised patch introduces a more specific check for infinite values using `is_infinite` and distinguishes between positive and negative infinity. This approach ensures that the method correctly handles the case when `n` is positive infinity by returning `S.Infinity`, aligning with the expected behavior. Additionally, it introduces error handling for negative infinity, which is not a valid input for Bell numbers, thereby improving the robustness of the method. This adjustment should help in passing the tests that failed previously by ensuring that the method behaves correctly for all types of inputs.
