As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified key components in the codebase that are related to the issue:\n\n1. **Limit Method**: The `limit` method appears in several files, but the most relevant ones for our issue are likely to be in `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. These files contain the implementation of the limit functionality that is being called incorrectly or not handling the case of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` as expected.\n\n2. **Bell Class**: The `bell` class is defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`. This class contains methods related to Bell numbers, including the `eval` method, which is likely where the logic to handle `bell(oo)` should be implemented or fixed. The `eval` method is where the evaluation of the Bell number for a given argument is defined, and it seems this is where the logic might need to be adjusted to correctly handle the limit case.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around how the `limit` method interacts with the `bell` class, specifically how the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity is evaluated. The expected behavior is for `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` to return infinity (`oo` in SymPy), but instead, it returns `bell(oo)`, which suggests that the limit is not being evaluated as expected.\n\nTo further investigate and potentially fix this issue, we might need to look into how the `limit` method is implemented for the `bell` class or how the `bell` class's `eval` method handles the case when its argument is infinity. Adjusting the logic in one of these areas to correctly interpret the limit as infinity when the argument approaches infinity could resolve the issue."
