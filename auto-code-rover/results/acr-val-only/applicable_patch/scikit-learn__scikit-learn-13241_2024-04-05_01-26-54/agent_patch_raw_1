# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py</file>
<original>self.alphas_ = self.alphas_[:, indices]</original>
<patched># Ensure consistent sign orientation of the eigenvectors across different runs
# by making the largest absolute value in each eigenvector positive.
self.alphas_ = self.alphas_[:, indices]
for i in range(self.alphas_.shape[1]):
    max_abs_index = np.argmax(np.abs(self.alphas_[:, i]))
    if self.alphas_[max_abs_index, i] < 0:
        self.alphas_[:, i] = -self.alphas_[:, i]</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py</file>
<original>X_transformed = self.alphas_ * np.sqrt(self.lambdas_)</original>
<patched># Apply the square root of eigenvalues only to non-negative eigenvalues to avoid NaNs
# This is a safety check and does not directly relate to the sign issue but is good practice.
X_transformed = self.alphas_ * np.sqrt(np.maximum(self.lambdas_, 0))</patched>
```

These modifications address the issue of sign inconsistency in the KernelPCA results by ensuring that the largest absolute value in each eigenvector is positive, which should make the orientation of the eigenvectors consistent across different runs. The second modification is a safety measure to ensure that the square root is only applied to non-negative eigenvalues, preventing potential NaN values in the transformed data.
