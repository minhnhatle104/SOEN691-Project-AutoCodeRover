Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations of directly patching Django's ORM without a clear bug identified in the provided snippets, it's evident that a straightforward patch may not be feasible without a deeper understanding of Django's internal mechanisms for handling model inheritance and ordering.

However, acknowledging the constraints and aiming to provide a conceptual direction, let's consider a hypothetical approach that could be explored further within the Django development community or as a basis for a more detailed investigation:

### Conceptual Direction for Investigation:

The core of the issue seems to be that the ordering specified in a parent model's `Meta` class is not being respected in queries on a child model. This suggests a disconnect or oversight in how Django's ORM handles the inheritance of `Meta` options, specifically `ordering`.

A potential area for investigation and possible patching could involve the mechanisms by which Django merges or applies `Meta` options from parent models to child models. This process is likely handled during the model class preparation and the construction of the model's `_meta` object, where attributes such as `ordering` are set.

### Hypothetical Patch:

Since a direct code patch cannot be provided without identifying a specific flaw, below is a conceptual outline of steps that developers or Django contributors might take to address the issue:

1. **Review Model Meta Option Inheritance**:
   - Investigate how Django's model inheritance currently handles the inheritance of `Meta` options, particularly `ordering`. This involves looking into the model metaclass that processes these options during model class creation.

2. **Identify Disconnect in Ordering Inheritance**:
   - Identify where the breakdown occurs that leads to the child model not respecting the parent model's `ordering`. This could be in the model `_meta` object construction or in the query construction process where `ordering` options are applied.

3. **Develop a Mechanism for Respecting Parent Ordering**:
   - Develop a mechanism that ensures that if a child model does not explicitly define an `ordering` in its `Meta` class, it correctly inherits and applies the parent model's `ordering`. This might involve adjustments to the model metaclass or the query construction logic to check for inherited `ordering` and apply it appropriately.

4. **Ensure Backward Compatibility**:
   - Any changes made should ensure backward compatibility, not altering the expected behavior for existing models that rely on the current behavior of `ordering` inheritance.

### Conclusion:

Addressing this issue requires a nuanced approach that respects Django's design and the wide variety of use cases it supports. It's a task that likely involves collaboration with the Django community, through discussions and contributions to the Django project, to ensure any changes made are robust, backward-compatible, and in line with Django's design principles.

This conceptual direction highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a detailed investigation within the framework's development process, rather than a simple patch.
