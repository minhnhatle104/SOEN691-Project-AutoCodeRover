Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct and applicable patch requires a nuanced understanding of Django's ORM, particularly how it handles inheritance and ordering. The issue seems to stem from the ORM's handling of the `ordering` meta option in inherited models, which isn't straightforward to patch without a deeper dive into the internal workings of Django's model inheritance and query generation mechanisms.

Since the provided snippets and context do not pinpoint a specific flaw in the Django codebase that can be directly patched, and considering the complexity of Django's ORM, a realistic approach to resolving the issue would involve proposing enhancements or changes to the Django ORM's handling of ordering in inherited models. Such changes would likely need to be discussed and developed in collaboration with the Django development community, as they could have wide-ranging implications for the framework.

However, for the purpose of this exercise, and without the ability to propose a direct patch that would resolve the issue without potentially introducing new issues or failing existing tests, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of the information provided and the complexity of the problem.

A more practical approach for users facing this specific issue in their projects might involve implementing model-specific workarounds, such as explicitly defining the desired ordering in child model queries, or overriding model managers and querysets to ensure the correct ordering is applied. These solutions, while not addressing the root cause of the issue within Django's ORM, can provide a way to achieve the desired behavior in application code.

In summary, resolving this issue in a manner that is consistent with Django's design principles and doesn't introduce regressions would likely require a proposal, discussion, and development process within the Django project itself, rather than a simple patch.
