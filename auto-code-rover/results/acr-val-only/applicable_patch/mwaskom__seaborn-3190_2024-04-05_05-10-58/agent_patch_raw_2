Given the feedback and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, let's refine the approach to handling boolean data in the normalization process. The goal is to ensure compatibility with seaborn's existing functionality while correctly handling boolean data types. Here's an updated patch that focuses on adjusting the normalization process for boolean data without altering the behavior for other data types.

# modification 1
```python
<file>seaborn/_core/scales.py</file>
<original>            vmin, vmax = axis.convert_units((vmin, vmax))
            a = forward(vmin)
            b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)

            def normalize(x):
                return (x - a) / b</original>
<patched>            vmin, vmax = axis.convert_units((vmin, vmax))
            # Adjust handling for boolean data to avoid subtraction operation
            if isinstance(data.dtype, (np.bool_, bool)):
                # Map True/False to 1.0/0.0 explicitly to avoid subtraction with boolean types
                a, b = 0.0, 1.0
            else:
                a = forward(vmin)
                b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)

            def normalize(x):
                # For boolean data, map True/False directly to 1.0/0.0
                if isinstance(data.dtype, (np.bool_, bool)):
                    return x.astype(float)
                return (x - a) / b</patched>
```

This revised patch explicitly checks if the data type is boolean and, if so, avoids the subtraction operation by setting `a` and `b` for normalization directly to `0.0` and `1.0`, respectively. For boolean data, it maps `True`/`False` directly to `1.0`/`0.0` during normalization. This approach should maintain the expected behavior for numeric data types while correctly handling boolean data, thus avoiding the `TypeError` and ensuring that all tests pass.
