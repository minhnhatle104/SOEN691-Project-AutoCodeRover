            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to gather more context about the implementation details of the methods and classes involved in the traceback. Specifically, I will focus on understanding how color mapping is handled and how boolean data is causing a failure. The relevant parts of the traceback include the `_plot` method in the `Plot` class, the `_setup_scales` method in the `Plotter` class, and the `_setup` method in the `ContinuousBase` class, which seems to be where the error occurs. Additionally, understanding how the `Scale` class and its subclasses are implemented could provide insights into why boolean subtraction is being attempted.\n\nHere are the API calls I will make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"Plot\", \"_plot\")` to understand how plotting is initiated and how scales are set up.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"Plotter\", \"_setup_scales\")` to get details on how scales are prepared for plotting.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"ContinuousBase\", \"_setup\")` to investigate the implementation details where the error occurs, particularly how it handles different data types.\n4. `search_class(\"Scale\")` to get an overview of the `Scale` class hierarchy and its role in handling plot scales, which might reveal how boolean values should be managed.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue's context and guide the development of a patch to handle boolean color mapping correctly."
