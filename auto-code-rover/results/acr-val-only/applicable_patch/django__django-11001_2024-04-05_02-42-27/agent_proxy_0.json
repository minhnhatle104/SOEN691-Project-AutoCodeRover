Additionally, understanding how `ordering_parts` is defined and used within the context of `SQLCompiler` is crucial. Therefore, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SQLCompiler\")`: This will help us locate the `SQLCompiler` class within the codebase to understand its structure and the context in which `get_order_by` method operates.\n\n2. `search_method(\"get_order_by\")`: Since the issue is directly related to the `get_order_by` method, searching for it in the entire codebase will help us find all occurrences and possibly related implementations or overrides.\n\n3. `search_code(\"ordering_parts\")`: Understanding how `ordering_parts` is defined and used is crucial for addressing the issue, especially since the problem seems to stem from how it processes multiline SQL queries. \n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the issue, allowing for a more informed approach to devising a solution."
