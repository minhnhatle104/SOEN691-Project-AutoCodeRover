Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, it's clear that a different approach is needed. The core issue remains that the method incorrectly identifies duplicates in the `ORDER BY` clause when dealing with multiline `RawSQL` expressions. The initial attempt to convert the SQL to a single line before applying the `ordering_parts` regular expression might not have been sufficient or could have introduced other issues.

A more robust solution would involve enhancing the duplicate detection logic to consider the entire `RawSQL` expression, including all its lines, without merely converting it to a single line. This can be achieved by improving the way duplicates are checked, perhaps by using a more comprehensive hash of the SQL and its parameters.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</file>
<original>if (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:
                continue
            seen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))</original>
<patched>full_sql_hash = make_hashable((sql, params))
            if full_sql_hash in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(full_sql_hash)</patched>
```

This modification changes the duplicate detection mechanism to use a hash of the entire SQL statement and its parameters, rather than just the part of the SQL statement without the ordering direction. This approach ensures that the uniqueness check considers the full context of the `RawSQL` expression, including all its lines, thereby accurately identifying duplicates without being misled by similarities in the last line of different expressions.

This solution assumes the existence of a `make_hashable` function that can create a hashable representation of the SQL and its parameters, which was implied by the original code snippet. If such a function does not exist or does not work as expected with the full SQL and parameters, it may need to be implemented or adjusted accordingly.

Please note, while this approach aims to address the issue without the unintended side effects of the initial patch, thorough testing is recommended to ensure compatibility with all expected use cases and to verify that it does not introduce any new issues.
