Specifically, the methods that are likely to contain the bug are:\n    - `_print_Sum`: This method is responsible for the pretty printing of `Sum` expressions and is a primary suspect for the alignment issue between the `x` and `+ 3`.\n    - `_print_Mul`: Since this method also contains references to `Sum` and is involved in the pretty printing of multiplication operations, it could potentially affect how `Sum` expressions are combined with additional operations, impacting their alignment."
