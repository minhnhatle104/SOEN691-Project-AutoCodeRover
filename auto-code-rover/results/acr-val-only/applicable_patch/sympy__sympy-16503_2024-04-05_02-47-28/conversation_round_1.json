        "content": "Based on the search results, we found that there isn't a class named `PrettyPrint` or a method named `pprint` directly in the codebase, which suggests that the pretty printing functionality might be implemented under a different name or it's part of a larger system that handles the rendering of mathematical expressions in a human-readable format.\n\nHowever, we did find the `Sum` class within the `sympy/concrete/summations.py` file. This class is likely responsible for handling summation operations, including their creation, manipulation, and possibly their presentation. Given that the issue is related to the presentation of a `Sum` operation, particularly how it's pretty-printed alongside additional operations (like `+ 3`), it's reasonable to assume that the solution might involve adjusting how instances of the `Sum` class are rendered or how they interact with the pretty printing system.\n\nSince we didn't find direct references to a pretty printing system, it's possible that the pretty printing functionality is either part of a larger utility module or is integrated into the classes representing mathematical expressions, like `Sum`. \n\nTo proceed, we should look into how the `Sum` class interacts with any pretty printing functionality. This could involve searching for methods within the `Sum` class that are responsible for rendering or formatting, or looking for any utility functions or classes that are specifically designed to handle the pretty printing of expressions involving `Sum`.\n\nGiven the current context, the next steps could involve:\n- Searching for methods within the `Sum` class that might be responsible for rendering or formatting.\n- Searching for any references to pretty printing or formatting within the file where the `Sum` class is defined, which could lead us to utility functions or systems used for pretty printing.\n\nLet's proceed with:\n- search_method_in_class(\"render\", \"Sum\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"format\", \"Sum\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"pretty\", \"sympy/concrete/summations.py\")"
