Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, a deeper understanding of the pretty printing mechanism for `Sum` expressions and their alignment with additional operations is necessary. The alignment issue might not solely be due to the baseline calculation but could also involve how the components of the `Sum` expression and additional operations are assembled together.

Upon re-examination of the provided code snippets and considering the nature of the issue, it seems that the alignment problem might be better addressed by adjusting how the sum and additional operations are combined rather than just tweaking the baseline adjustment. However, without specific details on the failed tests and how the patch did not resolve the issue, the next best approach is to propose a more generalized solution that ensures better alignment of the components.

Given this, a potential area for adjustment could be in the way additional operations (like `+ 3`) are integrated with the pretty-printed `Sum` expression. This integration likely happens in the `_print_Sum` method when constructing the final `prettyF` object that represents the formatted expression. However, without explicit code showing this integration, providing a precise patch is challenging.

A hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that additional operations are aligned with the main body of the `Sum` expression by adjusting their placement relative to the `Sum`'s baseline. This could involve modifying how `prettyF` is combined with other parts of the expression (not shown in the provided code snippets).

Since the initial patch did not resolve the issue and without specific details on the integration of `Sum` expressions with additional operations, I'll provide a general direction for a patch that could be explored:

# modification 1 (Hypothetical direction)
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>prettyF = prettyForm(*prettySign.right(prettyF))</original>
<patched># Adjust the placement of additional operations (like '+ 3') relative to the Sum's baseline
# This is a hypothetical direction. Specific implementation would depend on how additional operations are handled.
# One approach could be to adjust the baseline or the right alignment of prettyF when combining with prettySign or additional operations.
prettyF = adjust_additional_operations_alignment(prettySign, prettyF, additional_operations)</patched>
```

Explanation: This modification suggests a direction rather than a specific patch, due to the lack of detailed insight into how additional operations are combined with the `Sum` expression's pretty print. The idea is to introduce a method or adjust the existing logic to better align additional operations with the `Sum` expression, possibly by adjusting their baselines or how they are combined (`prettySign.right(prettyF)`). This approach requires a deeper dive into the codebase to implement a method like `adjust_additional_operations_alignment`, which would handle the alignment more gracefully.

Given the constraints and the information provided, I recommend reviewing how additional operations are integrated with the `Sum` expression's pretty print and exploring adjustments in that integration process to resolve the alignment issue.
