```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2</original>
<patched>prettyF.baseline = max_upper + (sign_height - prettyF.height())//2</patched>
```

Explanation: The issue with the alignment of the `x` and `+ 3` in the pretty print of the `Sum` expression seems to stem from how the baseline for the entire expression is calculated. The original calculation does not consider the height of the pretty-printed function `prettyF` when setting its baseline relative to the summation sign and the upper limit. By adjusting the baseline calculation to account for the height of `prettyF`, we can ensure that the function part of the `Sum` expression is more appropriately aligned with additional elements like `+ 3`. This patch aims to correct the vertical alignment by adjusting the baseline so that `prettyF` is centered with respect to the summation sign, taking into account its own height.
