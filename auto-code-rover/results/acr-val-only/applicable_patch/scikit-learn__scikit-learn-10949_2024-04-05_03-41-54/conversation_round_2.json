The expected behavior, when `warn_on_dtype=True`, is to issue a warning if the input data needs to be converted to a different dtype (in this case, from `object` to `float64`). However, this warning is not being raised when the input is a pandas DataFrame.\n\nGiven the error in locating the `validation` class, it's possible that the function `check_array` is not part of a class named `validation` or the class name might be different, or the function could be in a module rather than a class. \n\nTo proceed with the analysis, we should try to locate the `check_array` function directly in the codebase since it's a crucial part of understanding why the warning is not being issued as expected.\n\nLet's adjust our approach and search for the `check_array` method directly in the entire codebase to find its implementation and analyze how it handles pandas DataFrames and dtype warnings.\n\n---\n\nsearch_method(\"check_array\")"
