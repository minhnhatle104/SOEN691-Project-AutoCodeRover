Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's important to revisit the approach while keeping in mind the constraints of the `check_array` function and how it interacts with pandas DataFrames. A more refined patch should focus on accurately detecting the conversion of data types, especially for pandas DataFrames, without introducing dependencies that might not be universally applicable or could cause other parts of the function to behave unexpectedly.

Considering the original implementation does not explicitly check for pandas DataFrame inputs before performing dtype checks and issuing warnings, a more generalized approach that doesn't assume the presence of pandas (thus avoiding potential import errors or dependency issues) might be necessary.

Let's propose a revised patch that focuses on improving the dtype comparison logic to ensure it accurately reflects conversions from object types, potentially including a more robust way to handle inputs that are pandas DataFrames without directly checking for that type (since direct type checks could introduce compatibility issues or dependencies on pandas being imported).

### Revised Patch:

```python
<file>sklearn/utils/validation.py</file>
<original>if warn_on_dtype and dtype_orig is not None and array.dtype != dtype_orig:
    msg = ("Data with input dtype %s was converted to %s%s."
           % (dtype_orig, array.dtype, context))
    warnings.warn(msg, DataConversionWarning)</original>
<patched>if warn_on_dtype and dtype_orig is not None:
    # Enhanced check to account for potential conversion scenarios more accurately
    dtype_changed = not np.can_cast(array_orig.dtype, array.dtype, casting='safe')
    if dtype_changed:
        msg = ("Data with input dtype %s was converted to %s%s."
               % (dtype_orig, array.dtype, context))
        warnings.warn(msg, DataConversionWarning)</patched>
```

**Explanation:**
This revised patch changes the approach to determining whether a dtype conversion warning should be issued. Instead of directly comparing `dtype_orig` with `array.dtype`, it uses `np.can_cast` with the `casting='safe'` argument to check if the original dtype can be safely cast to the new dtype without losing information. This method is more robust and can accurately detect when a conversion (that should warrant a warning) has occurred, including but not limited to conversions from object types in pandas DataFrames. This approach avoids direct dependency on pandas and makes the check more universally applicable to various input types that `check_array` might handle.

Note: This solution assumes that `array_orig.dtype` is accessible and correctly reflects the original dtype of the input. If `array_orig` does not have a `dtype` attribute (e.g., if it's not an ndarray or similar), additional checks or try-except blocks might be necessary to ensure compatibility.
