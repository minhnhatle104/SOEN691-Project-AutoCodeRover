Given the feedback, it seems there was an oversight in the initial patch. Let's refine the approach by ensuring that the `__matmul__` method correctly identifies matrix-like objects and only proceeds with the operation if both operands are indeed matrices. This refined approach will also consider the structure and conventions of the SymPy library more carefully.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/common.py</file>
<original>    def __matmul__(self, other):
        return self.__mul__(other)
</original>
<patched>    def __matmul__(self, other):
        # Ensure both operands are matrices for matrix multiplication.
        if not getattr(other, 'is_Matrix', False):
            raise ValueError("Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead for scalar multiplication.")
        return self._eval_matrix_mul(other)
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that `__matmul__` in `MatrixArithmetic` only proceeds with matrix multiplication if the `other` operand is indeed a matrix, aligning with the behavior described in the issue. The check uses the `is_Matrix` attribute, which is a common pattern in SymPy for identifying matrix objects. The method `_eval_matrix_mul` is used for matrix multiplication, assuming it's the appropriate method within the `MatrixArithmetic` class for handling such operations directly.

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py</file>
<original>    def __matmul__(self, other):
        return MatMul(self, other).doit()
</original>
<patched>    def __matmul__(self, other):
        from sympy.matrices.expressions.matexpr import MatrixExpr
        # Ensure both operands are matrix expressions for matrix multiplication.
        if not isinstance(other, MatrixExpr):
            raise ValueError("Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead for scalar multiplication.")
        return MatMul(self, other).doit()
</patched>
```

For the `MatrixExpr` class, the patch ensures that `__matmul__` only allows operations between matrix expressions, which is consistent with the intended use of matrix multiplication. The check uses `isinstance` to verify that `other` is an instance of `MatrixExpr`, ensuring compatibility with the matrix expression framework within SymPy.

These modifications aim to address the issue more accurately by enforcing the requirement that both operands must be matrices (or matrix expressions) for the `@` operator to be used, thereby preventing scalar operands from being mistakenly allowed in matrix multiplication operations.
