The issue arises due to how this method handles the order of media files when merging, leading to potentially unnecessary warnings.\n\nGiven the specific references to the `merge` method in the `Media` class and the definition of `MediaOrderConflictWarning` in the same file, the location for the bug seems accurately identified based on the provided context and the nature of the issue described.\n\nNo further context appears necessary for identifying the bug location based on the provided information and the analysis conducted. The next steps would involve proposing a solution or patch based on this understanding of the issue's location and mechanism."
