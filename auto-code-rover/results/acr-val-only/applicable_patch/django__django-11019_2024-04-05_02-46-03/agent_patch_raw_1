This patch modifies the `merge` method in the `Media` class to refine the conditions under which a `MediaOrderConflictWarning` is issued. The original code issues a warning whenever it finds the same media files in both lists (`list_1` and `list_2`) but in a different order. The patched version adds an additional check to ensure that a warning is only issued if there are no intermediate dependencies between the conflicting files in the original lists that would justify their reversed order in the merged list. This aims to reduce unnecessary warnings when the order of media files is logically correct due to their dependencies.
