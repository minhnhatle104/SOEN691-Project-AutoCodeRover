To address the issue of generating man page section directories in a way that conforms to `MANPATH` search functionality, we need to modify the `write` method in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`. The goal is to ensure that each generated man page is placed within the appropriate section directory (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.). This involves adjusting the destination path for each man page based on its section.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/builders/manpage.py</file>
<original>destination = FileOutput(
                destination_path=path.join(self.outdir, targetname),
                encoding='utf-8')</original>
<patched>import os
destination = FileOutput(
                destination_path=path.join(self.outdir, "man" + section, targetname),
                encoding='utf-8')
os.makedirs(path.join(self.outdir, "man" + section), exist_ok=True)</patched>
```

This modification ensures that each man page is saved in a directory corresponding to its section. The `os.makedirs` call with `exist_ok=True` ensures that the directory is created if it does not already exist, without raising an error if the directory already exists.

Please note, the `import os` statement is added at the beginning of the file (if not already present) to ensure that the `os.makedirs` function is available for use.
