However, the files that are likely involved in the issue and may contain the relevant code to be patched include:\n\n1. `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` - This file is a primary candidate as it contains multiple matches for `man_pages` and is likely responsible for the logic around building and organizing man pages in the output directory.\n\n2. `sphinx/writers/manpage.py` - Although only one match was found for `man_pages`, this file may handle aspects of writing or formatting the man pages, which could be relevant to ensuring they are placed in the correct section directories.\n\nFurther analysis of these files with the specified search queries is needed to identify the exact locations within the code that require modification to address the issue."
