To address the issue of generating man page section directories in a way that conforms to `MANPATH` search functionality, we need to modify the `write` method in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`. The goal is to ensure that each generated man page is placed within the appropriate section directory (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.). This involves adjusting the destination path for each man page based on its section.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/builders/manpage.py</file>
<original>destination = FileOutput(
                destination_path=path.join(self.outdir, targetname),
                encoding='utf-8')</original>
<patched>destination = FileOutput(
                destination_path=path.join(self.outdir, "man" + section, targetname),
                encoding='utf-8')
                os.makedirs(path.join(self.outdir, "man" + section), exist_ok=True)</patched>
```

This modification ensures that each man page is saved in a directory corresponding to its section. The `os.makedirs` call with `exist_ok=True` ensures that the directory is created if it does not already exist, without raising an error if the directory already exists.

Additionally, to fully support this feature, it might be beneficial to document this change and inform users about the new directory structure of the generated man pages. This could involve updating the documentation and possibly adding configuration options if users need to customize this behavior further. However, without access to the full project repository and documentation, specific instructions for these updates cannot be provided here.
