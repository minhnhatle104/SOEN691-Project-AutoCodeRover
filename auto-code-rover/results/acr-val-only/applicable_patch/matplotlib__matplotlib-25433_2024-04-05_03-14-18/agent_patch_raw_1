Given the context and the issue described, a potential patch could involve ensuring that when the figure is cleared (`pyplot.clf()`), the widgets are properly re-initialized and their event listeners are re-attached correctly. This solution assumes that the primary issue is the loss of widget functionality due to the clearing and redrawing of the figure, which might be disconnecting the event listeners.

However, without the ability to modify the internal workings of `pyplot.clf()` or the event dispatching mechanism directly, a workaround can be proposed in the user's code. This involves modifying the `addElements` function to ensure that widgets are re-initialized with their event listeners every time the figure is cleared and redrawn.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/widgets.py</file>
<original>def on_changed(self, func):
    """
    Connect *func* as callback function to changes of the slider value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Function to call when slider is changed. The function
        must accept a 2-tuple of floats as its argument.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Connection id (which can be used to disconnect *func*).
    """
    return self._observers.connect('changed', lambda val: func(val))
</original>
<patched>def on_changed(self, func):
    """
    Connect *func* as callback function to changes of the slider value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Function to call when slider is changed. The function
        must accept a 2-tuple of floats as its argument.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Connection id (which can be used to disconnect *func*).
    """
    # Ensure any existing connection for 'changed' is removed before connecting a new one
    # This prevents multiple callbacks from stacking if this method is called multiple times
    self._observers.disconnect('changed')
    return self._observers.connect('changed', lambda val: func(val))
</patched>
```

# modification 2

    # Reconnect the on_changed event to ensure it's properly attached after redrawing
    slider.on_changed(onchanged)
    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])
    global button
    button = widgets.Button(ax, "Test")
    # Reconnect the on_clicked event to ensure it's properly attached after redrawing
    button.on_clicked(onclick)
    addElements()
    pyplot.show()</patched>
```

This patch aims to address the issue by ensuring that event listeners are correctly managed, especially after the figure is cleared and redrawn. The first modification ensures that any existing connections are cleared before a new one is made, preventing potential issues from multiple callbacks being registered. The second modification is a suggestion for the user's code, ensuring that widgets are re-initialized with their event listeners correctly re-attached after the figure is cleared.
