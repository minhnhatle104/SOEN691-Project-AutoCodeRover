Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears that a direct modification to the Matplotlib library's source code or suggesting changes that cannot be directly applied is not feasible. Instead, the solution should focus on a workaround that can be implemented in user code without requiring modifications to the library itself. 

Considering the limitations and the need for a solution that can be applied without altering the Matplotlib source code, let's propose a workaround that users can implement on their side to mitigate the issue.

The core of the problem seems to be the loss of widget functionality due to the disconnection of event listeners when the figure is cleared (`pyplot.clf()`) and redrawn. A viable workaround is to ensure that widgets and their event connections are properly re-established after the figure is cleared.

Since direct modifications to the `RangeSlider` and `Button` classes or the `pyplot.clf()` method are not applicable, the workaround will focus on the user's code, specifically on how to manage the lifecycle of widgets and their event connections around the figure clearing operation.

### Workaround in User Code

The idea is to encapsulate the widget creation and event connection logic in a way that it can be easily re-invoked after clearing the figure. This involves defining a setup function for widgets that can be called both initially and after the figure has been cleared.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.widgets as widgets

# Global references to widgets
slider = None
button = None

def setup_widgets():
    global slider, button
    ax_slider = plt.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])
    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax_slider, "Test", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))
    slider.on_changed(onchanged)

    ax_button = plt.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])
    button = widgets.Button(ax_button, "Test")
    button.on_clicked(onclick)

def onchanged(values):
    print("on changed")
    print(values)
    plt.clf()  # Clear the figure
    setup_widgets()  # Re-setup widgets
    plt.draw()

def onclick(event):
    print("on click")
    plt.clf()  # Clear the figure
    setup_widgets()  # Re-setup widgets
    plt.draw()

setup_widgets()
plt.show()
```

This workaround does not modify the Matplotlib library itself but instead provides a pattern for users to follow when they need to dynamically update figures with widgets. By encapsulating the widget setup in a dedicated function (`setup_widgets`), it becomes straightforward to re-establish the widgets and their event connections after clearing the figure, thus maintaining the desired interactivity.
