**Note**: The proposed patches aim to address the issue by ensuring that the `from django.db import models` import statement is correctly added to migration files whenever models or fields are referenced. The first modification directly checks for model or field references in the `as_string` method of `MigrationWriter` and adjusts the import logic accordingly. The second modification marks when the `models` import is needed during serialization of fields, managers, or model classes, leveraging a hypothetical flag (`MigrationWriter.needs_models_import`). This approach assumes the ability to modify or access attributes of `MigrationWriter` from within the `serializer_factory` function, which may require additional architectural changes or the introduction of a mechanism to communicate such requirements between components.
