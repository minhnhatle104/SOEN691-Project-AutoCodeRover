Given the constraints and the need to ensure that the generated migration files correctly import the `models` module from Django when necessary, a more precise approach is required. The initial attempt aimed to dynamically determine the need for importing `models` based on the operations involved in the migration. However, considering the failure of the tests and the need for a simpler, more reliable solution, let's focus on ensuring that the `models` import is always correctly managed without introducing additional flags or checks that might not cover all cases.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/writer.py</file>
<original>        # django.db.migrations is always used, but models import may not be.
        # If models import exists, merge it with migrations import.
        if "from django.db import models" in imports:
            imports.discard("from django.db import models")
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations, models")
        else:
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations")</original>
<patched>        # Ensure models import is added if the migration involves model operations.
        # This approach simplifies the handling by always including models when there are model-related operations.
        if any(isinstance(op, migrations.CreateModel) or isinstance(op, migrations.AlterModelTable) for op in self.migration.operations):
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations, models")
        else:
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations")</patched>
```

This modification directly addresses the issue by ensuring that `from django.db import models` is included in the imports whenever there are operations related to creating or altering models, which are the most straightforward indicators of needing the `models` module. This approach simplifies the logic and avoids the need for additional checks or flags that might not accurately capture all scenarios where `models` is required.

**Explanation**: The patched code looks through the migration operations and checks if any of them are instances of `CreateModel` or `AlterModelTable`, which are clear indicators that the migration involves direct manipulation of models and, therefore, would require access to `models`. This heuristic should cover the majority of cases where `models` would be needed in the migration file without introducing undue complexity or relying on potentially unreliable indicators.
