Given the constraints and the feedback, it appears that the initial approach to dynamically adjust imports based on the content of the migration operations might not be the most effective solution. Reflecting on the original issue and the Django migration system's architecture, the core problem lies in ensuring that the generated migration file includes the necessary `from django.db import models` import whenever model references are present, directly or indirectly, through fields or base classes.

Since the direct manipulation of import logic based on the migration's content has proven challenging and potentially error-prone, a revised approach should focus on ensuring the robustness and simplicity of the solution. Given the limitations in dynamically detecting all possible scenarios where `models` might be needed, a more straightforward and fail-safe patch would be to ensure that the import statement for `models` is always present in migration files, regardless of the detected need. This approach guarantees that the `NameError` described in the issue will not occur due to a missing import statement, at the cost of potentially including an unnecessary import in some migration files.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/writer.py</file>
<original>        # django.db.migrations is always used, but models import may not be.
        # If models import exists, merge it with migrations import.
        if "from django.db import models" in imports:
            imports.discard("from django.db import models")
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations, models")
        else:
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations")</original>
<patched>        # Adjusted approach to ensure 'models' import is always included when generating migration files.
        # This change aims to prevent 'NameError' issues by defaulting to include 'models' import, addressing scenarios where dynamic detection may fail.
        imports.add("from django.db import migrations, models")</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the migration files always include both `migrations` and `models` imports together. This approach is a compromise that prioritizes reliability and simplicity over optimizing for the minimal set of imports. By always including the `models` import, we eliminate the risk of encountering a `NameError` due to missing context for model references, at the expense of including this import even in migrations that might not strictly require it.

**Explanation**: The rationale behind this approach is to address the reported issue in a manner that ensures maximum compatibility and reliability across various use cases and custom model configurations. While it introduces a blanket solution that may include an unnecessary import in some cases, it effectively eliminates the risk of the specific `NameError` without requiring complex logic to dynamically determine the need for `models` import. This change should be considered a safe and straightforward way to ensure that all generated migration files have access to the necessary Django model infrastructure, thereby resolving the issue reported.
