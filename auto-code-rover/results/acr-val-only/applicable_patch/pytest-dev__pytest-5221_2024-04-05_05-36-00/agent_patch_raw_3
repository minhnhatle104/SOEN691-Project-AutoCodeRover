Given the constraints and the nature of the request, it appears there's been a misunderstanding in the approach to providing a direct patch without access to the specific parts of the codebase that handle the output of the `--fixtures` command. Since we cannot modify the logic for displaying fixtures directly due to the lack of specific context in that area, and given the limitations in resolving the issue without further actionable details or access, I must clarify that providing a precise and test-passing patch under these conditions is beyond the current capabilities.

The initial conceptual approach aimed to outline the necessary steps and considerations for implementing the requested feature based on the provided context and general understanding of how pytest and its fixture system work. However, without the ability to interact with the actual pytest codebase or detailed insights into the implementation of the fixtures listing functionality, creating a specific, actionable, and correct patch is not feasible in this scenario.

For a feature enhancement like displaying fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`, the typical development process would involve:

1. Identifying where in the codebase the output for the `--fixtures` command is generated.
2. Modifying that logic to include fixture scope information, which would likely involve accessing each fixture's metadata to retrieve its scope.
3. Testing the changes to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce regressions.

This process requires direct access to the codebase, the ability to run and modify the code, and the capability to run tests to verify the changes.

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would involve submitting a pull request to the pytest project with the proposed changes, accompanied by tests demonstrating the new functionality and ensuring that existing functionality is not adversely affected.

I apologize for any confusion and hope the discussion has been helpful in understanding the considerations involved in enhancing pytest with this feature.
