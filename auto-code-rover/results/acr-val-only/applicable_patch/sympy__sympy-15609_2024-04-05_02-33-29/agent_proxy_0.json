            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the LaTeX string is being generated for matrix expressions, particularly when indexing into the result of a matrix multiplication. The issue points to a problem with how subscripts are handled, leading to LaTeX syntax errors. Given this, we will focus on finding the relevant parts of the codebase that handle LaTeX string generation for matrix expressions and indexed elements.\n\n1. **Search for the class handling matrix symbols**: Since `MatrixSymbol` is mentioned, it's likely part of the mechanism generating the problematic LaTeX code. We'll start by searching for this class to understand its structure and related methods.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for LaTeX printing functionality**: The issue arises when converting an expression to LaTeX, so we need to find the method responsible for this conversion. It's common for such functionality to be named something like `to_latex`, `latex`, or be part of a larger LaTeX printing utility.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"latex\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for handling of indexed expressions**: Since the issue specifically involves indexed expressions (i.e., `(M*N)[i, j]`), we should look for how these are processed. This might be part of a method that handles general expression indexing or specifically tailored for LaTeX output.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"indexed\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to locate the relevant parts of the codebase where the issue might originate, providing a foundation for proposing a fix."
