Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial attempts did not resolve the issue, let's reconsider the problem with a focus on the core issue reported: LaTeX complains about a double subscript `_`. This problem arises from the way indexed matrix multiplication results are represented in LaTeX, specifically the naming convention used for temporary indices in the summation.

The issue likely stems from the way subscripts are formatted in the LaTeX representation of the matrix multiplication. The original code does not account for scenarios where the subscript naming convention could lead to LaTeX syntax errors, such as double subscripts.

Upon further reflection, a direct approach to solving this problem might not involve just the handling of subscripts in `_print_MatrixElement` or adjustments in `_print_Sum` or `_print_MatMul` alone. Instead, the solution should ensure that the generated subscripts for temporary indices in matrix operations are unique and comply with LaTeX syntax rules, avoiding constructs that lead to errors like double subscripts.

However, without specific methods that directly address the generation and handling of these temporary indices in the provided code snippets, proposing a precise patch is challenging. A more general approach would be required, focusing on ensuring that the naming of temporary indices during matrix operations does not conflict with LaTeX's syntax rules.

Given the limitations and the information provided, a hypothetical solution could involve introducing a method or modifying existing methods to sanitize or adjust the naming convention for indices in matrix operations before converting them to LaTeX. This approach would aim to detect and correct potential syntax issues proactively.

Since the specific implementation details and the exact location within the code where this adjustment should be made are not clear without further context, below is a conceptual outline of what such a solution might look like, rather than a direct code patch:

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code where indices for matrix operations are generated or handled before LaTeX conversion.
</original>
<patched>
# Conceptual patched code introducing a method or modification to sanitize or adjust indices naming.
def sanitize_indices_for_latex(self, index):
    """
    Adjusts the naming of indices to prevent LaTeX syntax issues, such as double subscripts.
    """
    # Example implementation that replaces problematic characters or patterns in index names
    # This is a placeholder and should be adapted to the specific needs and context of the actual implementation
    sanitized_index = str(index).replace("_", "\_")
    return sanitized_index

# Then, this method would be called wherever indices are generated or processed before converting to LaTeX,
# ensuring that the naming convention avoids syntax issues.
</patched>
```

This conceptual modification suggests a direction for addressing the issue by focusing on the root cause: the need to ensure that the naming convention for indices in LaTeX representations of matrix operations does not lead to syntax errors. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of where and how these indices are generated and processed in the codebase.
