This class includes methods for basic operations and properties related to matrix symbols, such as getting the shape, name, and handling substitutions.\n   - Given that the issue involves matrix symbols (`M` and `N`), it's likely that the problem isn't directly within the `MatrixSymbol` class itself but rather in how expressions involving these symbols are converted to LaTeX.\n\n2. **LaTeX Printing Functionality (sympy/printing/latex.py)**:\n   - The `latex` function is responsible for converting SymPy expressions into their LaTeX string representations. This function handles a wide range of expressions, including basic operations, trigonometric functions, integrals, matrices, and more.\n   - The function utilizes a `LatexPrinter` object, which likely contains the logic for handling different types of expressions, including matrix operations and indexed expressions.\n   - The issue described involves the generation of LaTeX code for an indexed matrix multiplication result, which suggests that the problem might be in how the `LatexPrinter` processes such expressions.\n\n3. **Indexed Expressions**:\n   - The search for a method named `indexed` did not yield results, which suggests that the handling of indexed expressions might not be isolated to a single method with that name. Instead, the logic for processing indexed expressions, especially in the context of LaTeX printing, might be embedded within the `LatexPrinter` class or related methods that handle general expression printing.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nThe issue likely stems from how the `LatexPrinter` class (or related functionality within the `latex` function) handles the conversion of indexed matrix multiplication expressions to LaTeX. The problematic output `\\sum_{i_{1}=0}^{k - 1} M_{i, _i_1} N_{_i_1, j}` suggests that there's a mishandling of subscript naming or concatenation, leading to invalid LaTeX syntax with double subscripts.\n\n**Next Steps**:\nTo further investigate and ultimately fix the issue, we should:\n- Examine the `LatexPrinter` class or related methods within `sympy/printing/latex.py` to understand how matrix expressions and their indexed results are converted to LaTeX.\n- Identify the specific logic that generates subscripts for indexed matrix multiplication results and revise it to ensure valid LaTeX syntax is produced, avoiding double subscripts or other syntax errors.\n\nGiven the current context, the next logical step would be to search for and examine the implementation of the `LatexPrinter` class or related methods that handle the printing of matrix expressions and their indices."
