Given the information provided, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. **Search for the `EnumSerializer` class**: This will help us understand how the serialization process is currently implemented and where we might integrate the suggested changes regarding enum decomposition.\n   \n   `search_class(\"EnumSerializer\")`\n\n2. **Search for the usage of `._decompose` method**: Since the issue description suggests using `enum._decompose` to handle cases where there is no single item for a given value, it's important to see if this method is already used somewhere in the codebase or if it will be a new addition.\n   \n   `search_method(\"_decompose\")`\n\n3. **Search for the code snippet related to the default value in migrations**: The issue mentions that a specific pattern of setting default values in migrations leads to an incorrect representation (`default=re.RegexFlag[None]`). Searching for this pattern might help us identify where the problem occurs and how widespread it is.\n   \n   `search_code(\"default=re.RegexFlag[None]\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the current state of the codebase in relation to the issue and how to approach fixing it."
