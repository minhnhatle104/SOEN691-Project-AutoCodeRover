The main area of focus has been identified (the `EnumSerializer` class), and the absence of the `_decompose` method in the codebase suggests that the solution will involve new development rather than modification of existing code. Therefore, additional context from the project is not required at this stage for planning the solution.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\n**Buggy file**: `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`\n\n**Buggy method**: The issue is likely within or related to the `serialize` method of the `EnumSerializer` class. This method is responsible for serializing enum values, and the issue description suggests that it does not currently handle the serialization of combined enum flags correctly."
