            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the `UserChangeForm` class and the initialization method `__init__` where the bug seems to originate. Specifically, we want to understand how the `password` field's `help_text` is being formatted and potentially find where the `UserAdmin` class is defined or used, as it seems to be related to the issue. Here are the API calls that would be most relevant:\n\n1. `search_class(\"UserChangeForm\")`: This will help us find the file and more context about the `UserChangeForm` class, including its definition and any relevant methods or properties that are not mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"UserChangeForm\")`: Since the issue mentions that the problem arises in the `__init__` method of the `UserChangeForm` class, this search will provide us with the exact implementation of the method, allowing us to understand how the `password` field's `help_text` is currently being set.\n\n3. `search_code('password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")')`: This search will help us find the exact location(s) in the codebase where the problematic formatting of the `password` field's `help_text` is happening, which is crucial for understanding the scope of the issue and ensuring that the patch is applied correctly.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of the context surrounding the issue, enabling us to devise an appropriate patch."
