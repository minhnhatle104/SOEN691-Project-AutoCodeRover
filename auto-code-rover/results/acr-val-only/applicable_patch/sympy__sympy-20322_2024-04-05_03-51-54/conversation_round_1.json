The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    convert_xor\n    -----------\n\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n    x**y\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n    x ^ y\n\n    rational\n    --------\n\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n    0.1\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n    1/10\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered.

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, let's analyze the relevant parts of the SymPy codebase to understand the issue and identify potential solutions.\n\n### sympify Function\nThe `sympify` function is crucial for converting Python objects into SymPy objects, which can then be manipulated by SymPy's symbolic math functions. The `evaluate` parameter in `sympify` controls whether the expression is evaluated or left in its original form. When `evaluate=False`, the expression is not simplified or altered, preserving the structure as entered by the user. This is important for the issue at hand because the inconsistency arises depending on the value of the `evaluate` parameter.\n\n### simplify Function\nThe `simplify` function attempts to simplify an expression into a more readable or more efficient form. The behavior of `simplify` can be influenced by how the expression was created or parsed, which is why the `evaluate` parameter in `sympify` plays a significant role. The inconsistency mentioned in the issue arises after applying `simplify` to expressions created with different `evaluate` settings.\n\n### ceiling Function\nThe `ceiling` function rounds up to the nearest integer. The issue seems to involve how expressions involving `ceiling` are simplified, particularly how the `evaluate` parameter during the `sympify` process affects the outcome after simplification.\n\n### Analysis\nThe inconsistency described in the issue arises between versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2 of SymPy, specifically in how expressions involving the `ceiling` function are simplified. In version 1.5.1, the expression `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)` remains unchanged regardless of the `evaluate` parameter during the `sympify` process. However, in version 1.6.2, when `evaluate=False`, the expression is simplified differently, resulting in `4*ceiling(x/4) - 3`.\n\nThis inconsistency could be due to changes in how the `evaluate` parameter is handled in either the `sympify` or `simplify` functions, or changes in the simplification rules for the `ceiling` function itself. Since the search for the specific code snippet involving `ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False` did not yield results, the issue likely lies in the broader handling of the `evaluate` parameter or the simplification logic.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo address the issue, we need to:\n1. Review the changes made to the `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling` functions between SymPy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2.\n2. Understand how the `evaluate` parameter's handling might have changed in these versions.\n3. Investigate the simplification rules for the `ceiling` function and how they interact with the `evaluate` parameter.\n\nBy comparing the implementations of these functions and their interactions across the two versions, we can identify the cause of the inconsistency and develop a patch to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the `evaluate` parameter's setting."
