Here are the API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `sympify` method**: This will help us understand how the `evaluate` parameter is handled within the method, which seems to be a crucial part of the issue.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(\"sympify\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `simplify` method**: Since the issue arises after calling `simplify`, understanding its implementation will be key to identifying why the behavior changes between versions.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(\"simplify\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the `ceiling` function**: Understanding how the `ceiling` function is implemented and interacts with other parts of the codebase might provide insights into why its behavior changes with the `evaluate` parameter.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(\"ceiling\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for the code snippet involving `ceiling` and `evaluate=False`**: This could help us find any specific handling or optimizations related to the `ceiling` function when `evaluate=False` is used.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of how the `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling` functions work individually and together, and how the `evaluate` parameter affects their behavior."
