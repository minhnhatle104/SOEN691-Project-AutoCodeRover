Given the context and the issue described, the inconsistency seems to stem from how expressions involving the `ceiling` function are simplified, particularly in relation to the `evaluate` parameter during the `sympify` process. However, without specific details on the internal logic changes between SymPy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2, pinpointing the exact location for a patch is challenging. 

The issue might not be directly within the `ceiling` function implementations themselves but rather in how expressions are simplified when `evaluate=False` is set during `sympify`. The `simplify` function's behavior might have been affected by changes in the global simplification routines or in how expressions are parsed and prepared for simplification.

Given this, a hypothetical patch might involve ensuring that the `evaluate` parameter's intention is preserved throughout the simplification process, especially for functions like `ceiling` that might have special cases. However, without a clear bug in the provided code snippets or a detailed understanding of the changes between versions, proposing a specific code change is speculative. 

A general approach to address such issues could involve adding checks or modifications in the `simplify` function to handle cases where `evaluate=False` more consistently, but without specific details on what changed or what the intended behavior should be, it's difficult to provide a concrete patch.

For educational purposes, here's an example of how a patch format might look if we were to hypothetically adjust the simplification process to account for the `evaluate` parameter more explicitly. This is not a real patch but an illustration of how one might structure it if a specific area of improvement were identified.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>
if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack
    return expr
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patch to check the evaluate parameter before simplification
if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args or not preserve_evaluation(expr):  # Added check
    return expr

def preserve_evaluation(expr):
    # Hypothetical function to ensure expressions with evaluate=False are handled correctly
    # This is a placeholder and would need to be implemented based on the specific logic required
    return True
</patched>
```

This example is illustrative and not a direct solution to the issue. Addressing the reported inconsistency would require a deeper dive into the changes between the SymPy versions mentioned and possibly adjusting the simplification logic to ensure that the `evaluate=False` parameter's behavior is consistent across versions.
