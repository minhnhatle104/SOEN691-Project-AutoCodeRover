Given the feedback, it seems the initial patch to simply add `header_rows` as a parameter to the `RST` class's `__init__` method is not sufficient to resolve the issue. The `RST` class must not only accept `header_rows` as an argument but also utilize it effectively to modify the output accordingly. Since the initial patch did not include logic to handle `header_rows` in the output generation, let's propose a more comprehensive solution.

This solution will involve two steps:
1. Modify the `__init__` method to accept `header_rows`.
2. Implement logic within the `write` method to use `header_rows` for generating the header in the RestructuredText output.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/rst.py</file>
<original>    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(delimiter_pad=None, bookend=False)</original>
<patched>    def __init__(self, header_rows=None):
        super().__init__(delimiter_pad=None, bookend=False)
        self.header_rows = header_rows</patched>
```

# modification 2
Assuming the `write` method in `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` needs to be adapted to handle `header_rows`, but since the actual implementation of the `write` method was not provided, I'll outline a conceptual patch that could be applied to incorporate `header_rows` into the output.

```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/rst.py</file>
<original>    def write(self, lines):
        # Original write method implementation</original>
<patched>    def write(self, lines):
        if self.header_rows:
            # Example logic to handle header rows
            header_lines = self._format_header_rows(self.header_rows)
            lines = header_lines + lines
        # Continue with the rest of the write method implementation</patched>
```

This conceptual patch outlines how the `write` method could be modified to prepend `header_rows` to the output if they are provided. The `_format_header_rows` method (which would need to be implemented) should format the header rows according to the RestructuredText specifications.

Please note, the actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of how the `write` method processes `lines` and how `header_rows` should be formatted to fit into the existing structure of the RST output. This solution provides a direction for implementing the requested feature but would need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements and existing code structure of the `RST` class.
