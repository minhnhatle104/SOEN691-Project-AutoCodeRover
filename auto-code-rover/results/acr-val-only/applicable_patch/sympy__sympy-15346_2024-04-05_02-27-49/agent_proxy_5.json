Given the analysis and the information provided:\n\n- do we need more context:\n\n- where are bug locations: \n```plaintext\nThe potential locations related to the issue could be:\n1. File: sympy/simplify/simplify.py, Method: simplify - This method is responsible for simplifying expressions, including trigonometric functions, and may not handle specific cases involving rational numbers within trigonometric functions optimally.\n2. Since the Matrix class operations are spread across multiple files, the exact location within the matrix-related files (e.g., sympy/matrices/common.py or sympy/matrices/matrices.py) could not be pinpointed without more detailed investigation. However, the interaction between matrix operations and the simplify method could be a key area to investigate.\n```"
