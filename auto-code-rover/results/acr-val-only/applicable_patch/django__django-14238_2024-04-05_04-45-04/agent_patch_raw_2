Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to directly address the issue without altering the behavior of other parts of the Django framework that might rely on the current implementation. The goal is to ensure that `MyBigAutoField` and similar custom fields that subclass `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField` are recognized as valid subclasses of `AutoField` for the purpose of being used as a primary key. 

The initial approach attempted to modify the `__subclasscheck__` method and the `_subclasses` property in a way that might have broader implications than intended. A more focused approach could involve ensuring that the check for a valid primary key class in `_get_default_pk_class` method accommodates custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` without requiring modifications to the `AutoFieldMeta` class.

Given this, let's adjust the strategy:

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/db/models/options.py</file>
<original>        if not issubclass(pk_class, AutoField):
            raise ValueError(
                f"Primary key '{pk_class_path}' referred by {source} must "
                f"subclass AutoField."
            )</original>
<patched>        # Adjusting the check to also consider subclasses of BigAutoField and SmallAutoField
        from django.db.models.fields import BigAutoField, SmallAutoField
        if not (issubclass(pk_class, AutoField) or issubclass(pk_class, BigAutoField) or issubclass(pk_class, SmallAutoField)):
            raise ValueError(
                f"Primary key '{pk_class_path}' referred by {source} must "
                f"subclass AutoField, BigAutoField, or SmallAutoField."
            )</patched>
```

This modification directly addresses the issue by expanding the check in `_get_default_pk_class` to explicitly include `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` along with their subclasses. This way, the system will correctly recognize `MyBigAutoField` (and similar custom fields) as valid primary key classes without altering the behavior of `AutoFieldMeta` or other parts of Django that rely on its current implementation. This approach minimizes the risk of unintended side effects from the patch.
