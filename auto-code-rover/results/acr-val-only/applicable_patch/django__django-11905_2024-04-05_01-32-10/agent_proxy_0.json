            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find where the `__isnull` lookup is implemented or processed in the codebase. Since `__isnull` is a lookup, it's likely part of a query processing or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. Given the nature of the issue, it's important to find the method or class responsible for handling `__isnull` to ensure we can properly enforce the restriction on using boolean values only.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"__isnull\")`: This will help us find any methods directly named `__isnull` or methods that are likely to process the `__isnull` lookup.\n2. `search_code(\"__isnull\")`: This will help us find any code snippets where `__isnull` is mentioned, which could lead us to the implementation or usage of the `__isnull` lookup that needs modification."
