Here's a breakdown of the findings and their implications for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **django/db/models/query.py**:\n   - The `__isnull` lookup is used in the methods `dates` and `datetimes` of the `QuerySet` class. In both instances, `__isnull` is used with a hardcoded boolean value (`False`), which is a correct and intended use case. These instances do not directly contribute to the issue at hand but demonstrate the usage pattern of `__isnull` within query construction.\n\n2. **django/db/models/sql/query.py**:\n   - The `split_exclude` method in the `Query` class constructs a filter condition using `__isnull`. This snippet shows how `__isnull` is integrated into the query construction process, particularly in handling outer joins. The method dynamically builds a filter condition, which suggests this could be a place where validation for boolean values in `__isnull` lookups could be enforced.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The issue described is about preventing the use of non-boolean values with the `__isnull` lookup to avoid confusion and ensure consistency. The search results do not directly show where non-boolean values are accepted or processed for `__isnull` lookups. However, they do indicate where `__isnull` is used within the ORM layer.\n- The `split_exclude` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is particularly interesting because it dynamically constructs a filter with `__isnull`. This suggests that the method or its vicinity could be involved in processing `__isnull` lookups and, therefore, might be a suitable location to introduce validation for boolean values.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- To address the issue, we need to ensure that `__isnull` lookups only accept boolean values. This likely involves adding validation logic in the query construction or processing stages, possibly in areas where `__isnull` lookups are interpreted or compiled into SQL queries.\n- The `split_exclude` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is a potential location for implementing such validation. However, without seeing the broader context of how lookups are processed in the method or class, we cannot definitively pinpoint the exact insertion point for the validation logic.\n\nGiven the current context, the next step would be to review the `Query` class, particularly methods involved in filter construction and lookup processing, to identify where to enforce the boolean value constraint for `__isnull` lookups."
