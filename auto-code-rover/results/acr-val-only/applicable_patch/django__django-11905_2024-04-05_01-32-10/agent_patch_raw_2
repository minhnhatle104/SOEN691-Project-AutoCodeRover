Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, it seems the approach to directly modify the `split_exclude` method may not be the most effective or correct way to enforce the boolean value constraint for `__isnull` lookups. Instead, the validation should likely occur at a more centralized location where lookups are processed or validated, ensuring that the boolean constraint for `__isnull` is enforced across all usage scenarios without causing unintended side effects.

However, without direct access to more specific parts of the codebase where lookups are parsed or validated, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. A more general approach would involve adding validation in the method responsible for parsing or applying lookups, ensuring that when `__isnull` is encountered, its value is checked to be a boolean.

Since the direct modification in `split_exclude` was not appropriate, let's consider a hypothetical patch that would be applied in a method responsible for handling lookups more broadly. This example assumes the existence of a method `apply_lookup` where lookups are processed.

# modification 1 (hypothetical)
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code where lookups are applied
def apply_lookup(self, lookup_name, value):
    # Lookup application logic
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patched code with added validation for __isnull lookups
def apply_lookup(self, lookup_name, value):
    if lookup_name == '__isnull' and not isinstance(value, bool):
        raise ValueError("__isnull lookup requires a boolean value.")
    # Lookup application logic
</patched>
```

This modification is hypothetical and assumes the existence of a method `apply_lookup` that is responsible for applying lookups. The patch introduces a check specifically for the `__isnull` lookup to ensure that its value is a boolean. If a non-boolean value is passed, a `ValueError` is raised, which directly addresses the issue described.

Please note, the actual implementation would require identifying the correct location in the Django ORM codebase where lookups are parsed or applied. The concept demonstrated in this hypothetical patch should be adapted to the specific structure and methods of the Django ORM.
