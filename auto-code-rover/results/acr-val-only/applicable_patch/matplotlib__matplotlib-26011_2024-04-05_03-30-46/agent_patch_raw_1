Based on the issue description and the provided context, the problem lies in the handling of the `emit` parameter within the `set_xlim` method of the `_AxesBase` class. The issue suggests that when an axis limit change is induced by a shared axis, the `xlim_changed` callbacks are not being called because the `emit` parameter is set to `False` for sibling axes. A potential solution involves ensuring that `xlim_changed` callbacks are triggered for all shared axes, even when the change is induced by a sibling axis. However, care must be taken to avoid recursion issues that may arise from setting `emit=True` directly within the shared axes loop.

Given the constraints and the goal to resolve this issue, here is a proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py</file>
<original>
return self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)
</original>
<patched>
result = self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)
if emit:
    for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
        if other is not self:
            other.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', other)
return result
</patched>
```

This patch modifies the `set_xlim` method to ensure that after setting the x-axis limits, if `emit` is `True`, it explicitly triggers the `xlim_changed` callbacks for all sibling axes that share the x-axis with the current axis. This approach aims to address the issue without introducing recursion, as it processes the callbacks after the limits have been set, and only if `emit` is `True`. This ensures that the callbacks are only processed once per change, avoiding the potential recursion issue mentioned in the original issue description.

Please note, this patch is based on the understanding of the issue from the provided context and assumes that the `self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self)` method correctly retrieves all sibling axes that share the x-axis with the current axis, and that `other.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', other)` is the correct way to manually trigger the `xlim_changed` callbacks for the sibling axes. Further testing and validation would be necessary to ensure that this patch fully resolves the issue without introducing any new problems.
