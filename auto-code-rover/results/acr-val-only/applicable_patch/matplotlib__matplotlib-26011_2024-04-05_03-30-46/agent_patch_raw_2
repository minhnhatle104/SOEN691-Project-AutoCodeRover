Given the feedback and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, a revised approach is necessary. The original patch aimed to directly trigger `xlim_changed` callbacks for all shared axes after setting the limits. However, if this approach led to test failures, it's possible that the solution needs to be more nuanced, particularly to avoid unintended side effects or recursion issues.

A potential issue with the original patch could be the indiscriminate triggering of `xlim_changed` callbacks for all sibling axes without considering the current state of those axes or additional conditions that might be necessary to prevent recursion or other side effects.

A refined approach could involve adding a mechanism to ensure that `xlim_changed` callbacks are only triggered when there is an actual change in the limits of the sibling axes, and to do so in a way that does not lead to recursion. This might involve checking the current limits before setting new ones and only proceeding with the callback if there is a change.

```python

<patched>
# Store the original limits before setting new ones
original_limits = self.get_xlim()
# Set the new limits
result = self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)
# Check if the limits have changed and if emit is True
if emit and original_limits != self.get_xlim():
    # Explicitly trigger xlim_changed callbacks for all sibling axes
    for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
        if other is not self:
            # Trigger the callback only if the limits have actually changed
            other_limits = other.get_xlim()
            if other_limits != original_limits:
                other.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', other)
return result
</patched>
```

This revised patch first stores the original x-axis limits before setting new ones. After setting the new limits, it checks if the limits have actually changed and if `emit` is `True`. If both conditions are met, it then iterates over all sibling axes, checks if their limits have changed compared to the original limits, and only then triggers the `xlim_changed` callbacks. This approach aims to minimize unnecessary callback triggers and prevent recursion by ensuring that callbacks are only processed when there is an actual change in the axis limits.

Please note, this solution assumes that the `get_xlim` method accurately retrieves the current x-axis limits and that comparing these limits before and after the change can effectively determine whether an update has occurred. This patch should be thoroughly tested to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems or failing existing tests.
