Given the issue description and the code context provided, the problem seems to arise from the interaction between the figure management in `Gcf` and the backend or configuration changes possibly influenced by `rc_context`. The issue is that calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`. However, without a clear indication that `get_backend` or `rc_context` directly modifies `Gcf.figs`, the problem might lie in how figures are tracked or managed in relation to backend changes.

Since the provided code snippets and analysis do not pinpoint a specific flaw in the implementation of `get_backend`, `Gcf`, or `rc_context` that would directly cause the described issue, the patch will focus on ensuring that figure references in `Gcf.figs` are not inadvertently cleared upon backend queries. This approach is speculative and aims to safeguard against potential side effects of backend queries on figure management.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>def get_backend():
    """
    Return the name of the current backend.

    See Also
    --------
    matplotlib.use
    """
    return rcParams['backend']
</original>
<patched>def get_backend():
    """
    Return the name of the current backend without affecting figure management.

    See Also
    --------
    matplotlib.use
    """
    from matplotlib._pylab_helpers import Gcf
    # Store a copy of the current figures to restore after backend query
    current_figs = Gcf.figs.copy()
    backend = rcParams['backend']
    # Restore figures to ensure backend query does not clear them
    Gcf.figs = current_figs
    return backend
</patched>
```

This modification attempts to preserve the state of `Gcf.figs` across backend queries by explicitly copying and restoring it around the backend retrieval operation. This approach is a workaround that addresses the symptom (figures being cleared) rather than the root cause, which remains unidentified without a deeper dive into how backend queries interact with figure management and `rc_context`.

It's important to note that this patch is speculative and should be thoroughly tested, especially to ensure it does not introduce unintended side effects in figure management or backend behavior. Further investigation is recommended to understand the underlying cause of the issue and to develop a more targeted solution.
