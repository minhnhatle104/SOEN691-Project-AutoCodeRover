I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's refine the approach to ensure the patch correctly addresses the issue without causing test failures. Given the context and the goal to prevent developers from defining a `related_name` on symmetrical `ManyToManyFields`, the validation should happen early in the `__init__` method after determining if the field is symmetrical. This approach minimizes the impact on other logic within the method.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/related.py</file>
<original>        if symmetrical is None:
            symmetrical = (to == RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT)
</original>
<patched>        if symmetrical is None:
            symmetrical = (to == RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT)
        
        # Validate that 'related_name' is not used with symmetrical ManyToManyField
        if symmetrical and related_name is not None:
            raise ValueError("Cannot use 'related_name' with a symmetrical ManyToManyField.")
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the validation for `related_name` usage with symmetrical `ManyToManyFields` is performed right after determining whether the field is symmetrical. This placement is chosen to ensure that the check is done as early as possible, preventing any further processing that might rely on the `related_name` in a context where it shouldn't be used. This approach should address the issue without affecting unrelated functionality or causing test failures.
