I understand the need to revise the patch to ensure it addresses the issue effectively and passes all tests. Given the initial attempt, let's refine the approach to modifying the `from_file` method in the Flask `Config` class to support a file mode parameter, ensuring compatibility with binary file operations such as those required by `tomllib.load` in Python 3.11. 

Considering the feedback, it's crucial to ensure that the patch not only adds the functionality but also maintains backward compatibility and does not introduce errors in existing tests. Let's adjust the patch with a more careful approach to handling the file mode and ensuring the `load` function is called correctly with the file object in the specified mode.

This revised patch includes the necessary parameter `mode` with a default value of `'r'`, ensuring backward compatibility. It also explicitly mentions the support for binary mode (`'rb'`) which is required for loading TOML files using `tomllib.load`, as described in the issue. This approach should address the issue while ensuring that existing functionality remains unaffected.
