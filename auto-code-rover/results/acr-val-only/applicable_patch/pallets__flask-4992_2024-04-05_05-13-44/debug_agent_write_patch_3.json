This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\n```\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\n```\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\n```\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\n```python\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\napp.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\n```\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, the `Config` class from Flask, specifically located in `src/flask/config.py`, contains the method `from_file` that we are interested in modifying. The current implementation of `from_file` is as follows:\n\n- It accepts three parameters: `self`, `filename`, and `load`. The `filename` parameter is the path to the data file, which can be either an absolute path or relative to the config root path. The `load` parameter is a callable that takes a file handle and returns a mapping of loaded data from the file. The `silent` parameter, if set to `True`, will ignore the file if it doesn't exist.\n- The method updates the values in the config from a file that is loaded using the `load` parameter. The loaded data is then passed to the `from_mapping` method.\n- The file is opened in text mode as indicated by the `open(filename)` statement without specifying a mode, which defaults to `'r'` (text mode).\n- The method handles file-related errors and raises an exception with a custom error message if the file cannot be loaded unless the `silent` parameter is set to ignore missing or directory files.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to modify the `from_file` method to accept an additional parameter that specifies the file mode. This will allow it to support binary mode (`'b'`), which is necessary for loading TOML files using Python 3.11's `tomllib.load` function, as well as maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality that expects files to be opened in text mode."
