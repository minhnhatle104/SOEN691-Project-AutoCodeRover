Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, it's crucial to revisit the approach and refine the patch to ensure it addresses the problem without introducing new issues. Let's adjust the patch to more accurately catch and handle `socket.error` exceptions during the streaming of response content in the `iter_content` method of the `Response` class.

                try:
                    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
                        yield chunk
                except IncompleteRead as e:
                    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)
                except DecodeError as e:
                    raise ContentDecodingError(e)
                except socket.error as e:  # Correctly handle socket errors
                    raise requests.exceptions.ConnectionError(e)
            except AttributeError:
                # Standard file-like object.
                try:
                    while True:
                        chunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)
                        if not chunk:
                            break
                        yield chunk
                except socket.error as e:  # Correctly handle socket errors
                    raise requests.exceptions.ConnectionError(e)</patched>
```

**Key Adjustments**:
- The patch now explicitly references `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` when re-raising the caught `socket.error` exceptions. This adjustment ensures that the correct exception type is used, aligning with the `requests` library's exception handling conventions.
- The comment has been updated to clarify the intention behind handling `socket.error` exceptions, emphasizing the goal of correctly wrapping these into `requests` exceptions.

**Additional Note**:
Ensure that both `socket` and `requests.exceptions` are imported at the top of the `requests/models.py` file. If not already present, add the following lines at the beginning of the file:

```python
import socket
import requests.exceptions
```

This refined patch aims to address the issue more accurately by ensuring that `socket.error` exceptions encountered during the streaming of response content are properly caught and re-raised as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This should provide a consistent and expected behavior for handling network-related errors within the `requests` library, improving the robustness of exception handling.
