Given the constraints and the failure of the initial patch attempt, let's consider a simpler approach to resolve the issue without introducing checks for specific method signatures or altering the handling of expressions significantly. The goal is to ensure that the `_print_Pow` method does not pass the `exp` keyword argument in a way that causes errors with functions that do not expect it, such as `_print_SingularityFunction`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>if expr.base.is_Function:
    return self._print(expr.base, exp=self._print(expr.exp))</original>
<patched>if expr.base.is_Function:
    # Directly handle the exponent part without passing it as a keyword argument
    base_latex = self._print(expr.base)
    exp_latex = self._print(expr.exp)
    return f"{base_latex}^{{{exp_latex}}}"</patched>
```

This modification directly constructs the LaTeX string for the base and exponent parts of the power expression, then combines them using LaTeX syntax for superscripts. This approach avoids passing `exp` as a keyword argument, thereby circumventing the issue where `_print_SingularityFunction` or similar methods do not expect such an argument. This should resolve the TypeError while maintaining the intended functionality of printing power expressions correctly in LaTeX format.
