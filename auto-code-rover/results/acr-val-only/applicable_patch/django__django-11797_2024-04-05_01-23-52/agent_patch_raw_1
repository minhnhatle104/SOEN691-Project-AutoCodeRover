Given the issue description and the code snippets provided, the issue seems to stem from how the `GROUP BY` clause is determined when chaining `filter`, `annotate`, and `values` methods together. The problem is that the final query does not maintain the `GROUP BY` clause as expected when a subquery is used in a filter condition. 

However, without specific details on how the underlying SQL is constructed and managed within these methods, proposing a precise patch is challenging. A general approach to address this issue would involve ensuring that when a subquery is constructed using `annotate` and `values`, the `GROUP BY` clause is correctly preserved or reconstructed in the final query.

Since the exact mechanism for how the `GROUP BY` clause is lost or incorrectly set is not detailed in the provided code snippets, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a conceptual approach rather than a ready-to-deploy solution.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>if clone._fields is None:
    clone.query.group_by = True
else:
    clone.query.set_group_by()</original>
<patched># Ensure GROUP BY fields are correctly determined when a subquery is involved
if clone._fields is None or isinstance(clone.query, Subquery):
    clone.query.group_by = True
    # Additional logic to correctly identify and set the fields for GROUP BY
    # when the query is a subquery. This might involve inspecting the subquery
    # to determine the correct fields to group by, especially when 'values' or
    # 'annotate' methods are used.
else:
    clone.query.set_group_by()</patched>
```

This modification suggests adding a check to see if the query is a subquery and, if so, applying a different logic to ensure the `GROUP BY` clause is correctly handled. The actual implementation of this logic would require a deeper understanding of the Django ORM's internals, specifically how it constructs and manipulates SQL queries for subqueries, annotations, and aggregations.

Please note, this patch is speculative and intended to illustrate a potential direction for solving the issue. Actual implementation might require a more in-depth modification of the Django ORM's query construction mechanisms.
