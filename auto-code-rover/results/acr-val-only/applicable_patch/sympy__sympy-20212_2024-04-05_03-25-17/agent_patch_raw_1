<original>if b is S.NaN:
    return (b**e)**other  # let __new__ handle it</original>
<patched>from sympy import oo, zoo, S
if b is S.Zero and e is -oo:
    return zoo
elif b is S.NaN:
    return (b**e)**other  # let __new__ handle it</patched>
```

This patch introduces a condition to explicitly handle the case where the base `b` is `0` and the exponent `e` is negative infinity (`-oo`). According to the issue description and the SymPy documentation, `0**-oo` should evaluate to `ComplexInfinity` (`zoo`). The patch adds this condition before the existing check for `NaN` values, ensuring that the specific case of `0**-oo` is correctly handled to return `zoo`. This solution assumes that the `e` variable directly represents the exponent in the form that allows a simple comparison with `-oo`. If `e` is not in a directly comparable form, additional parsing or normalization of the exponent might be required before performing this check.
