Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the initial approach needs a more nuanced handling within the SymPy framework. The handling of `0**-oo` should be carefully integrated into the existing logic of the `_eval_power` method to ensure that it does not disrupt other functionalities and passes all tests. Let's attempt a different approach that more closely aligns with the internal logic of SymPy, particularly focusing on how it evaluates expressions involving infinity and zero.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/power.py</file>
<original>if other.is_integer:
    s = 1
elif b.is_polar:  # e.g. exp_polar, besselj, var('p', polar=True)...
    s = 1</original>
<patched>from sympy import oo, zoo, S
if b == S.Zero and other == -oo:
    return zoo
elif other.is_integer:
    s = 1
elif b.is_polar:  # e.g. exp_polar, besselj, var('p', polar=True)...
    s = 1</patched>
```

This modification introduces a direct check for the condition where the base `b` is exactly `S.Zero` (SymPy's representation of `0`) and the exponent `other` is exactly `-oo` (SymPy's representation of negative infinity). This check is placed at the beginning of the `_eval_power` method to ensure that this specific case is handled before any other logic is applied. 

By directly returning `zoo` (SymPy's representation of complex infinity) when this condition is met, the patch aims to correct the behavior of `0**-oo` without altering the handling of other expressions. This approach is designed to be minimally invasive, ensuring that existing functionality is preserved while addressing the specific issue reported. 

This solution assumes that the representations of `0` and `-oo` as `S.Zero` and `-oo`, respectively, are consistent throughout SymPy's codebase, which should be the case. However, it's important to thoroughly test this patch to ensure that it does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior changes in other parts of the library.
