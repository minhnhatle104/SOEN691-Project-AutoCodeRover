Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential patch would involve ensuring that the `ExpressionWrapper` correctly handles the compilation of negated `Q` objects into SQL. Since the issue arises when `~Q(pk__in=[])` is used, indicating that the negation might not be properly translated into the SQL equivalent, we need to ensure that the SQL generated correctly represents the negation.

However, without a clear bug in the provided code snippets and based on the description and analysis, it's challenging to propose a specific code change without making assumptions about the rest of the framework's internals. A generic approach to address such issues could involve adding logic to handle the negation more explicitly in the SQL generation process, but without specific insight into how the Django ORM handles these cases internally, this is speculative.

Given this, a speculative patch might look like this:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        return compiler.compile(self.expression)
</original>
<patched>    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        compiled_expression, params = compiler.compile(self.expression)
        if hasattr(self.expression, 'negated') and self.expression.negated:
            compiled_expression = "NOT ({})".format(compiled_expression)
        return compiled_expression, params
</patched>
```

This speculative patch wraps the compiled expression in a `NOT` clause if the expression has a `negated` attribute set to `True`. However, this is a speculative solution and might not be directly applicable without further context on how the Django ORM's compiler and the `Q` object handle negation and parameter passing.

It's important to note that changes to ORM internals can have wide-reaching effects, and any patch should be thoroughly tested across a variety of cases to ensure it doesn't introduce regressions or unexpected behavior. Additionally, contributing such a patch back to Django would involve engaging with the Django community, including discussions and code reviews, to ensure the change aligns with the project's design principles and standards.
