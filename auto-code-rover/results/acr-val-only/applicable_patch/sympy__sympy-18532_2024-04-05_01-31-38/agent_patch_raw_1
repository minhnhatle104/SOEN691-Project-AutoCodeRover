This patch modifies the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class to ensure that it returns objects with no `.args` in addition to checking if they are instances of `Atom` or the specified types. This change aligns with the correct definition of a leaf node as being an object that has no `.args`, addressing the issue raised.
