This revised patch changes the approach to handling the case when no types are specified. Instead of defaulting to `Atom`, it sets `types` to `None` and adds an additional condition to check if an expression has no arguments (`expr.args`). This ensures that the method returns objects with no `.args` when no specific types are requested, aligning with the correct definition of a leaf node. This approach should address the issue without affecting the performance significantly, as it still leverages the efficient traversal and type checking mechanisms.
