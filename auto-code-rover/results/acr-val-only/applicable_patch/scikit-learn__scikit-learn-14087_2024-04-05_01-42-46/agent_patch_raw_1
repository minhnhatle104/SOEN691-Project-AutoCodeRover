This modification addresses the `IndexError` by adding a try-except block around the problematic code section. The `except IndexError` block provides a fallback mechanism for scenarios where `coefs_paths` does not match the expected dimensions for multi-class scenarios when `refit=False`. This approach ensures that the code gracefully handles dimension mismatches while maintaining the intended functionality of averaging the coefficients based on the best indices across folds.
