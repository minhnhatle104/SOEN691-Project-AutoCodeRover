Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the issue, a more careful examination of the dimensions and logic for handling `coefs_paths` when `refit=False` is necessary. The error suggests that the way indices are used to access `coefs_paths` might not align with its dimensions in certain configurations, particularly when not refitting the model. 

A more robust solution would ensure that the dimensions of `coefs_paths` are correctly accounted for in all scenarios, including when `multi_class` is not `'ovr'` and `refit` is `False`. However, without the ability to directly test changes or access the full context of how `coefs_paths` is structured in all scenarios, proposing a precise patch is challenging. 

Given the constraints, a hypothetical patch might involve verifying the dimensions of `coefs_paths` before attempting to index into it, and adjusting the logic to handle different expected shapes. This approach aims to prevent `IndexError` by ensuring the indexing operation is always valid for the array's current shape.

This hypothetical modification introduces a check on the shape of `coefs_paths` to determine the correct indexing approach. It aims to handle different shapes of `coefs_paths` that might arise from different configurations of `multi_class` and `refit`. This approach is speculative and would need thorough testing with various configurations to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new ones.
