Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, let's consider a more nuanced approach. The core issue seems to be the inability to differentiate and selectively delete constraints when `unique_together` and `index_together` are defined on the same set of fields. The initial patch attempted to address this by removing the restriction on the number of constraints that can be deleted, but this approach may have unintended consequences, as indicated by the failed tests.

A more targeted solution would involve refining the logic to ensure that only the intended type of constraint (unique or index) is deleted, based on the `constraint_kwargs` provided. This requires a more precise identification of constraints to be deleted, potentially by enhancing the filtering logic to better distinguish between unique constraints and indexes.

```

This revised patch aims to more accurately filter and identify the constraints to be deleted by considering the type of constraint (`unique` or `index`) being targeted. The `meta_constraint_names` and `meta_index_names` sets are now built by checking the `constraint_kwargs` to determine whether a unique constraint or an index is being deleted. This allows the `_delete_composed_index` method to more precisely target the constraints that match the intended operation, reducing the risk of inadvertently deleting unrelated constraints or indexes. Additionally, the patch removes the limitation of only allowing a single constraint to be deleted, acknowledging scenarios where multiple constraints may validly need to be removed.
