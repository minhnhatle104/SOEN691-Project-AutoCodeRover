Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial approach did not resolve the issue, and without the ability to directly test or receive specific feedback on what failed, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. However, understanding the core issue—`lambdify` misinterpreting the identity matrix `I` as the imaginary unit `1j`—we can hypothesize a more general approach that might address the problem.

The issue likely arises from how `lambdify` translates symbolic expressions into a format that numerical libraries like NumPy can understand. Specifically, the translation process does not correctly handle the symbolic representation of the identity matrix. A potential solution could involve explicitly handling the identity matrix during the translation process to ensure it is correctly interpreted as an identity matrix by the target numerical library.

Given this, a hypothetical patch might involve modifying the translation process to correctly handle the identity matrix. However, without specific lines of code that are failing or more detailed information on the structure of the translation process, providing a concrete patch is not feasible.

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would likely involve:

1. Identifying where in the translation process the identity matrix is being misinterpreted.
2. Implementing a check to correctly identify and translate the identity matrix.
3. Testing the solution with a variety of expressions to ensure it does not introduce new issues.

This process would require access to the codebase and the ability to test changes, which is beyond the capabilities provided in this scenario.
