Explanation:
- The modification addresses the issue where `S(item.args[0]).is_negative` could potentially lead to a `SympifyError` when `item.args[0]` contains special characters or is not directly parsable by `sympify`. This is particularly problematic for `MatrixSymbol` names that include characters like `*`.
- By adding a `try-except` block, the code attempts to use the `.is_negative` property directly from the `item.args[0]` object, which should be available for numeric types and SymPy expressions without needing to convert them to SymPy objects using `sympify`.
- The `except AttributeError` block serves as a fallback for cases where `item.args[0]` does not have the `.is_negative` attribute, which can happen if `item.args[0]` is not a numeric type or a SymPy expression. In such cases, the code defaults to adding a `+` sign, maintaining the original behavior for objects that do not explicitly indicate negativity.
- This approach avoids the unnecessary use of `sympify`, which can lead to parsing errors, especially with unsanitized input or input containing special characters not intended to be evaluated or parsed as expressions.
