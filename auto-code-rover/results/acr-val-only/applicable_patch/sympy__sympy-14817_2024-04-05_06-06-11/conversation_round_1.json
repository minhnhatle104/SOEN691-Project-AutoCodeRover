The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered.

It handles a wide range of inputs, including numeric types, strings, booleans, and collections of these types.\n   - The function uses `eval` for string inputs, which is a potential source of the issue mentioned. The error occurs when trying to parse an expression that cannot be directly evaluated or understood by SymPy.\n   - The function has several fallback mechanisms for conversion, including checking if the object implements a `_sympy_` method, checking against a `converter` dictionary for custom object conversion, and as a last resort, attempting to parse a string representation of the input.\n\n2. **`MatrixSymbol` Class Analysis**:\n   - Located in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, the `MatrixSymbol` class represents a symbolic matrix expression. It has properties like `shape`, `name`, and methods for substitution, simplification, and evaluation.\n   - The class is not commutative, which is important for matrix operations, and it supports differentiation with respect to itself (`_diff_wrt` is `True`).\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from the handling of `MatrixSymbol` objects and their string representations, particularly when involved in operations like addition (`MatAdd`). The error trace indicates a problem during the pretty printing process, where a `MatrixSymbol` with a name that includes a special character (`y*`) is not being correctly parsed or handled, leading to a `SyntaxError`.\n\nThe error suggests that the `sympify` function is being called with a string that it cannot parse (`'y*'`), possibly due to the way `MatrixSymbol` names are handled during the pretty printing process. The mention of the code omitting the `+` when the first argument is negative and assumptions about the form of `MatAdd` arguments indicate that there might be a deeper issue with how matrix expressions are being converted to strings and then re-parsed or interpreted.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to:\n- Investigate how `MatrixSymbol` names are converted to strings during pretty printing and why `sympify` is being invoked in this context.\n- Understand the logic behind handling negative arguments in `MatAdd` during pretty printing and why it might lead to parsing issues.\n- Consider if the use of `sympify` for string representations in this context is appropriate or if there should be a more robust method for handling symbolic matrix expressions during pretty printing.\n\nA potential solution might involve modifying the pretty printing logic for `MatAdd` to ensure that `MatrixSymbol` names are handled correctly, avoiding unnecessary calls to `sympify` with string inputs that it cannot parse. Additionally, reviewing the assumptions about the form and printing of `MatAdd` arguments could help identify and correct the underlying logic error."
