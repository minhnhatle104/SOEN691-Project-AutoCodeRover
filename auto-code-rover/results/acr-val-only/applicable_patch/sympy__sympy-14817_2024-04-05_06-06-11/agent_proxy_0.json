            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to gather more context about the implementation of pretty printing for `MatAdd` and how `sympify` is being used in this context. Specifically, I will focus on the `pretty_print` function, the `_print_MatAdd` method, and the `sympify` function, as these are directly mentioned in the traceback and seem to be at the core of the issue. Additionally, understanding how `MatrixSymbol` is implemented might provide insight into how its string representation is handled, which seems to be part of the problem.\n\nHere are the API calls I will make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"pretty_print\", \"./sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")` - This will help understand how `pretty_print` is implemented and calls other functions or methods.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"_print_MatAdd\", \"./sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")` - This will provide context on how `MatAdd` objects are handled during pretty printing.\n3. `search_method(\"sympify\")` - Since `sympify` is mentioned in the traceback and seems to be a part of the issue, understanding its implementation across the codebase could be crucial.\n4. `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")` - Understanding the `MatrixSymbol` class will provide insight into how these objects are expected to behave and be represented, which seems relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue, allowing for a more informed approach to devising a solution."
