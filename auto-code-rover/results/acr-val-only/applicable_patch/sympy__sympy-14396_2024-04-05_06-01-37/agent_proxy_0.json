Specifically, I am interested in how the `Poly` constructor handles the `domain` argument and how the domain specification is validated and processed. Additionally, understanding the error handling mechanism, particularly the generation of the `OptionError`, could provide insights into how to improve the error message.\n\nGiven this, I will make the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Poly\")`: To get an overview of the `Poly` class, including its constructor and any relevant methods that handle the `domain` argument.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"preprocess\", \"Options\")`: Since the traceback indicates that the `preprocess` method of an `Options` class is involved in processing the `domain` argument, I want to examine this method to understand how domain specifications are handled.\n3. `search_code(\"raise OptionError\")`: This will help me understand where and how `OptionError` exceptions are raised within the codebase, which is crucial for improving the error message."
