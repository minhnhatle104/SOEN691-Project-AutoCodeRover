To address the issue with the failed tests, it's important to refine the implementation of `__radd__` to ensure it handles all possible scenarios correctly. Given the nature of `SimpleLazyObject`, it's crucial that the `__radd__` method not only performs the addition operation correctly but also respects the lazy initialization pattern. Let's attempt a more robust implementation that might address potential edge cases or issues that could have caused the tests to fail.

            result = SimpleLazyObject(self._setupfunc)
            memo[id(self)] = result
            return result
        return copy.deepcopy(self._wrapped, memo)</original>
<patched>def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            # We have to use SimpleLazyObject, not self.__class__, because the
            # latter is proxied.
            result = SimpleLazyObject(self._setupfunc)
            memo[id(self)] = result
            return result
        return copy.deepcopy(self._wrapped, memo)

    def __radd__(self, other):
        # Ensure the lazy object is initialized
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            self._setup()
        # Check if the wrapped object has a __radd__ method itself
        if hasattr(self._wrapped, '__radd__'):
            return self._wrapped.__radd__(other)
        # Fallback to using the left-hand addition if __radd__ is not implemented
        # This mirrors the behavior of Python's addition when the right-hand operand
        # does not know how to handle the left-hand operand
        return NotImplemented</patched>
```

This modification introduces a more cautious approach to implementing `__radd__`. It first checks if the wrapped object has its own `__radd__` method and uses it if available. This respects the behavior of the wrapped object more closely. If the wrapped object does not implement `__radd__`, it returns `NotImplemented`, which is the correct behavior in Python when an operation is not supported between the two operands. This approach should help in passing the tests by handling cases where the wrapped object either supports reverse addition out of the box or does not support it at all.
