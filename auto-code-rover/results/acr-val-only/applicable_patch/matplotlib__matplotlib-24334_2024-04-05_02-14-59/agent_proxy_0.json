Search for the `Axes` class to understand its structure and methods, especially `set_xticks` since it's directly mentioned in the issue:\n   - `search_class(\"Axes\")`\n\n3. Search for the `set_ticks` method within the `Axis` class to get its implementation details:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_ticks\", \"Axis\")`\n\n4. Search for the `set_xticks` method within the `Axes` class to get its implementation details:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_xticks\", \"Axes\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive understanding of how `set_xticks` and `set_ticks` are implemented and how they handle `kwargs`, which is crucial for addressing the issue."
