Based on the issue description and the provided code snippet, the bug seems to be that the `viewcode` extension still generates pages for ePub format even when the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration is set to `False`. The provided code correctly checks this configuration before proceeding with the generation process. However, since the issue persists, it suggests that the condition might not be effectively preventing the generation process in all scenarios, particularly when both `html` and `epub` targets are built together (`make html epub`). 

Given the current context, a direct patch to the provided code snippet might not resolve the issue if the problem lies elsewhere in the build process or in how configurations are handled when multiple build targets are specified. However, the provided code snippet does not show an obvious bug in the implementation of the condition itself.

To ensure a comprehensive solution, further investigation would be needed into how the `make html epub` command processes configurations for each target and how the `viewcode` extension is invoked in each case. Without additional context indicating a specific error in the provided `doctree_read` function, suggesting a patch directly to this function might not address the root cause of the issue.

Given the limitations, here's a hypothetical patch that ensures the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration is explicitly checked and logged, which could help in further debugging. This is more of a diagnostic step rather than a direct fix:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/viewcode.py</file>
<original>if app.builder.name.startswith("epub") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
    return</original>
<patched>if app.builder.name.startswith("epub"):
    if not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
        app.logger.debug("Skipping viewcode generation for ePub as viewcode_enable_epub is False")
        return
    else:
        app.logger.debug("Proceeding with viewcode generation for ePub")</patched>
```

This modification adds logging to help identify whether the condition is correctly evaluated during the build process. It's a diagnostic step to gain more insight into the issue, rather than a final solution. Further analysis would likely be required to identify the exact cause of the issue and to implement a more targeted fix.
