Given the constraints and the information provided, it seems that the initial analysis and the speculative patch did not address the core issue effectively. The problem lies in the `viewcode` extension generating pages for the ePub format even when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. The condition in the `doctree_read` function appears to be correctly formulated but does not prevent the generation of `viewcode` pages under certain conditions, such as when building multiple formats simultaneously.

Since the direct modification to the condition did not resolve the issue, and considering the limitations of the provided context, a more precise patch cannot be accurately determined without additional insights into how Sphinx processes configurations for multiple build targets or without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of the `viewcode` extension.

However, based on the existing code and the issue described, a potential oversight could be in how the build process is managed for different output formats, particularly in handling configurations that are specific to one format when multiple formats are being built. A more robust solution might involve ensuring that format-specific configurations are correctly isolated and applied only when the relevant format is being processed.

Without the ability to further investigate or access more detailed logs or error messages from the build process, and given the failure of the speculative patch, the best course of action would be to recommend further investigation by the project maintainers or contributors with a deeper understanding of the Sphinx build process and the `viewcode` extension's integration.

For users facing this issue, a temporary workaround might involve separating the build commands for different formats, ensuring that the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration is respected when building the ePub format independently:

```bash
$ make html
$ make epub
```

This approach might avoid the issue related to configuration handling when building multiple formats simultaneously. However, it's important to note that this is a workaround rather than a solution to the underlying issue.

In summary, without the ability to provide a more accurate patch due to the limitations of the provided context and the complexity of the issue, further investigation by the project's maintainers or a deeper dive into the Sphinx documentation and source code would be necessary to resolve the issue effectively.
