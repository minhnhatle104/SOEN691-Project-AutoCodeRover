The issue mentions that imported members are included even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`. This suggests that we should look into how the `autosummary` extension processes this setting and filters members accordingly.\n\nGiven the information, the following API calls would be relevant to gather more context:\n\n1. **Search for the autosummary extension**: Since the issue is related to the `autosummary` extension, we need to find where it is implemented in the Sphinx codebase. However, the provided APIs do not directly allow searching for an extension, but we can search for classes or methods that are likely part of this extension. As we don't have a specific class name related to `autosummary`, we'll start by searching for methods that could be involved in member filtering or configuration handling.\n\n2. **Search for configuration handling method**: The issue mentions a configuration option `autosummary_imported_members`. There must be a method that reads or processes this configuration option.\n\n3. **Search for member filtering method**: The core of the issue seems to be in how members are filtered based on the `autosummary_imported_members` setting. Therefore, we should look for a method that performs this filtering.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following API calls seem appropriate:\n\n- `search_method(\"autosummary\")`: This is a broad search to find methods related to `autosummary`. It might give us a starting point.\n- `search_code(\"autosummary_imported_members\")`: Since we are interested in how the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is processed, searching for this specific code string could lead us to relevant parts of the codebase.\n\nThese searches aim to locate the parts of the code responsible for the described issue, specifically how the `autosummary` extension decides which members to include in the generated documentation."

Here's a summary and analysis of the findings:\n\n1. **`sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py` in `process_generate_options` function**:\n   - This snippet shows where `autosummary_imported_members` is read from the Sphinx app configuration and passed to the `generate_autosummary_docs` function. It indicates that the `autosummary_imported_members` setting influences the generation of autosummary documentation by controlling whether imported members are included.\n   - The use of `mock(app.config.autosummary_mock_imports)` suggests that there's also functionality to mock imports, which might be relevant but is not directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n2. **`sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py` in `setup` function**:\n   - This snippet shows where the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration value is added to the Sphinx app, with a default value of an empty list (`[]`) and a type expectation of `bool`. This is crucial because it defines the configuration option that users can set in their `conf.py` file to control the behavior of autosummary regarding imported members.\n   - The configuration option is marked as not rebuild-triggering (`False`), meaning changes to this setting do not automatically trigger a rebuild of the documentation.\n\n3. **`tests/test_ext_autosummary.py` in `test_autosummary_imported_members` function**:\n   - This snippet points to a test case designed to verify the behavior of `autosummary_imported_members`. It suggests that there is an existing test that could be relevant for understanding how `autosummary_imported_members` is supposed to work or for adding new test cases to cover the reported issue.\n\n**Analysis**:\nThe issue reported is that imported members are included in the autosummary documentation even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`. From the search results, it's clear that `autosummary_imported_members` is indeed a recognized configuration option and is intended to control the inclusion of imported members. The `process_generate_options` function in `__init__.py` is likely a key part of how this setting is applied during the documentation generation process.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n- Reviewing the implementation of `generate_autosummary_docs` to understand how the `imported_members` parameter is used to filter members.\n- Examining the test case `test_autosummary_imported_members` to see if it adequately covers the expected behavior or if it needs to be extended to capture the bug reported.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for developing a patch to ensure that `autosummary_imported_members` correctly excludes imported members from the generated documentation when set to `False`."

        "content": "The collected context from the `generate_autosummary_docs` function in `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py` and the test case `test_autosummary_imported_members` in `tests/test_ext_autosummary.py` provides valuable insights into how the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is handled and tested within Sphinx.\n\n### Analysis of `generate_autosummary_docs`\n\nThe `generate_autosummary_docs` function is responsible for generating the autosummary documentation. It accepts an `imported_members` boolean parameter, which is crucial for our issue. The function processes each source file, imports the necessary objects, and generates content based on the template and the `imported_members` setting. However, from the provided snippet, it's not immediately clear how the `imported_members` flag directly influences the filtering of members. The actual filtering logic might be encapsulated within the `generate_autosummary_content` function or elsewhere in the process that isn't visible in the snippet provided.\n\nKey observations:\n- The `imported_members` parameter is passed down to the `generate_autosummary_content` function, suggesting that the decision to include or exclude imported members is made at a deeper level in the code.\n- The function handles errors gracefully and logs warnings if an import fails, which is good practice but not directly related to the issue.\n- The recursive call to `generate_autosummary_docs` for new files suggests that the documentation generation process is thorough and designed to handle nested structures.\n\n### Analysis of `test_autosummary_imported_members`\n\nThe test case `test_autosummary_imported_members` is designed to verify the behavior of the `autosummary_imported_members` setting. However, the snippet does not provide details on how the test verifies the correct handling of imported members. It shows the setup for the test, indicating that it builds the documentation with a specific configuration, but the assertions or checks performed after the build are not visible.\n\nKey observation:\n- The test case exists, but without seeing the assertions or the specific setup in `testroot='ext-autosummary-imported_members'`, it's difficult to evaluate whether the test adequately covers the reported issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, while we have identified where the `imported_members` setting is passed around in the code, the exact mechanism of how imported members are filtered out (or mistakenly included) is not clear from the snippets provided. The bug likely resides in how the `imported_members` flag is interpreted and applied during the content generation process, possibly within the `generate_autosummary_content` function or related logic.\n\nThe test case for `autosummary_imported_members` is present, but without details on its implementation, it's hard to say whether it's sufficient for catching the reported issue. It might be necessary to enhance this test case to explicitly check for the absence of imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`.\n\nTo move forward, a deeper dive into the `generate_autosummary_content` function and a thorough review of the test case implementation would be necessary steps."
