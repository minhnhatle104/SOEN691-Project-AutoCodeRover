Given the context and the nature of the issue, a direct patch cannot be provided for `MyTransformer` since its implementation is not available in the provided context. However, I can suggest a general approach to modify the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function to handle potential issues related to DataFrame structure mismatches, which seems to be a part of the problem based on the error message and analysis.

The modification aims to add a more descriptive error message or a check to ensure that when data is being wrapped into a pandas DataFrame, the dimensions match the expected structure, especially when the `transform_output` is set to "pandas". This could help in diagnosing issues similar to the one described.

    if index is not None:
        # Ensure the index length matches the data's length to avoid "Length mismatch" errors
        if len(index) != len(data_to_wrap):
            raise ValueError(f"Length mismatch: Expected index has {len(index)} elements, "
                             f"data has {len(data_to_wrap)} elements. Ensure that the transformer's output "
                             "matches the expected structure when 'transform_output' is set to 'pandas'.")
        data_to_wrap.index = index
    return data_to_wrap</patched>
```

This modification adds a check to ensure that when setting the index of a DataFrame, the length of the provided index matches the length of the DataFrame. If there's a mismatch, it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message. This can help identify issues where the transformer's output does not match the expected structure, which is crucial when `transform_output` is set to "pandas".

Please note, this patch is more about improving error messaging and diagnosing issues rather than directly fixing the bug in `MyTransformer`, as the latter's code is not available for modification. Developers should ensure that their custom transformers produce outputs that correctly match the expected DataFrame structure when `transform_output` is set to "pandas".
