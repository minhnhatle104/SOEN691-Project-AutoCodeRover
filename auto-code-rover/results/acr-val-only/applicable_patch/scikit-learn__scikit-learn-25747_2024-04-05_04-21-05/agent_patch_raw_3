Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback that the initial patches did not resolve the issue, it's clear that the problem is more deeply rooted in the handling of the output structure by the custom transformer (`MyTransformer`) in conjunction with scikit-learn's expectations for DataFrame outputs when `transform_output` is set to "pandas".

Without the ability to directly modify or inspect `MyTransformer`, and considering that attempts to adjust the handling within `_wrap_in_pandas_container` did not resolve the issue, a direct patch to solve the problem cannot be accurately provided. The issue likely stems from a mismatch between the output structure of `MyTransformer` and the expected DataFrame format by scikit-learn utilities, which is not something that can be resolved without modifying the transformer's output or the expectations of the scikit-learn utility functions.

However, I can offer a conceptual approach that might guide the resolution:

1. **Ensure `MyTransformer` Outputs a Properly Structured DataFrame**: The transformer should output a DataFrame with an index that matches the expected format by downstream processes. This might involve ensuring that the aggregation or transformation logic within `MyTransformer` accounts for the final DataFrame's index and column structure.

2. **Review and Adjust the Expectations of Downstream Processes**: If `MyTransformer` is producing a logically correct output given its purpose, but scikit-learn utilities are not handling it as expected, it may be necessary to review how the output is processed downstream. This could involve custom handling of the output within the pipeline to ensure compatibility.

Given these considerations, a direct patch cannot be provided without access to modify the specific logic of `MyTransformer` or without a more detailed understanding of the failure modes of the tests that did not pass. The resolution requires a closer inspection and potentially a redesign of how `MyTransformer` integrates with scikit-learn's pipeline and utilities, especially regarding output data structures when `transform_output` is set to "pandas".
