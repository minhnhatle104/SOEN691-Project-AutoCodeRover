Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to modify `MyTransformer` and considering the failure of the initial approach to provide a diagnostic patch, a different strategy is needed. Since the core issue seems to revolve around the handling of DataFrame outputs when `transform_output` is set to "pandas", a more robust solution would involve ensuring compatibility of the transformer outputs with the expected DataFrame format by scikit-learn utilities.

However, without the ability to directly modify `MyTransformer`, we can suggest an enhancement to the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function to attempt automatic alignment of DataFrame indices when a mismatch is detected, rather than immediately raising an error. This approach aims to provide a more resilient handling of DataFrame outputs, particularly for custom transformers that aggregate data and may result in index length mismatches.

        except ValueError as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Failed to align DataFrame index in _wrap_in_pandas_container: {e}. "
                             "This may indicate a mismatch between the transformer's output structure "
                             "and the expected DataFrame format when 'transform_output' is set to 'pandas'.")
    return data_to_wrap</patched>
```

This modification attempts to use `reindex` to align the DataFrame's index with the provided index when a mismatch is detected. If reindexing fails (which could happen if the indices are incompatible), it raises a `ValueError` with a more detailed message. This approach aims to handle cases where the output DataFrame from a transformer might not directly align with the expected structure due to aggregation or other transformations.

It's important to note that this patch is a more forgiving approach to handling index mismatches and may not address all underlying issues with custom transformer outputs. It's recommended for developers to ensure their transformers produce outputs that are fully compatible with the expected DataFrame structure, especially when aggregation or significant data transformation is involved.
