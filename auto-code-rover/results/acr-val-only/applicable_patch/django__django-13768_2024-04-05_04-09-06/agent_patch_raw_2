```python
<file>django/dispatch/dispatcher.py</file>
<original>            except Exception as err:
                responses.append((receiver, err))</original>
<patched>            except Exception as err:
                # Import logging library at the top of the file, not within the method
                responses.append((receiver, err))
                # Log the exception using Django's logging framework
                from django.utils.log import getLogger
                logger = getLogger('django.dispatch')
                logger.error('Error calling signal receiver %s', receiver, exc_info=err)</patched>
```

Note: The import statement for the logging should ideally be placed at the top of the file, not within the method or exception block, to follow Python's convention for imports. The corrected patch assumes the import (`from django.utils.log import getLogger`) is moved to the top of the file where other imports are located. This change ensures that the logging of exceptions in signal receivers adheres to Django's logging practices, using Django's configured loggers.
