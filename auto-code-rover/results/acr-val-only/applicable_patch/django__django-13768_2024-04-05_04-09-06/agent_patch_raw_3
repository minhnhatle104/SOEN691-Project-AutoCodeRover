I apologize for the confusion earlier. Given the constraints and the need to ensure the patch does not introduce errors or fail tests, let's revise the approach with a focus on integrating the logging in a way that respects Django's design patterns and existing code structure. This time, I'll ensure the logging is done correctly without suggesting moving the import statement to the top, as that was not part of the original task.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/dispatch/dispatcher.py</file>
<original>            except Exception as err:
                responses.append((receiver, err))</original>
<patched>            except Exception as err:
                # Log the exception using Django's logging framework correctly
                from django.utils.log import getLogger
                logger = getLogger('django.dispatch')
                logger.exception("Exception raised in receiver: %r", receiver)
                responses.append((receiver, err))</patched>
```

In this revised patch, the logging is done directly within the `except` block to ensure that the exception is logged at the moment it occurs. The `logger.exception` method is used, which is specifically designed for logging exceptions, including the stack trace, providing more context about the error. This approach should not introduce any issues with tests, assuming the Django project's logging configuration is set up to handle such logs appropriately.
