```

This patch wraps the call to `self.norm.inverse` within a try-except block. If a `ValueError` is raised due to the norm being non-invertible (as is the case with `BoundaryNorm`), it handles the error gracefully by setting `neighbors` to an array of NaNs. This approach prevents the application from crashing while still allowing for interaction with the plot.
