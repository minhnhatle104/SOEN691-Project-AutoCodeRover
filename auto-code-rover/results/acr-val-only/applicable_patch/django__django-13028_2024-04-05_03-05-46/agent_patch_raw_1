Given the context and the nature of the issue, a direct patch to Django's ORM to accommodate this specific case might not be the most appropriate solution, especially considering the wide variety of use cases Django has to support. However, for educational purposes, I'll demonstrate a hypothetical patch that could be applied to bypass the `NotSupportedError` when a model field named `filterable` is present. This patch would be a workaround rather than a recommended practice, as modifying Django's internal behavior could lead to unexpected results in other parts of the application or framework.

```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>    def check_filterable(self, expression):
        """Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause."""
        if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):
            raise NotSupportedError(
                expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '
                'clause.'
            )
        if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):
            for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():
                self.check_filterable(expr)
</original>
<patched>    def check_filterable(self, expression):
        """Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause."""
        # Check if the expression explicitly defines a `django_filterable` attribute to bypass the check
        if hasattr(expression, 'django_filterable') and not expression.django_filterable:
            raise NotSupportedError(
                expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '
                'clause due to being explicitly marked as non-filterable.'
            )
        elif not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True) and not hasattr(expression, 'django_filterable'):
            raise NotSupportedError(
                expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '
                'clause.'
            )
        if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):
            for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():
                self.check_filterable(expr)
</patched>
```

This patch introduces a check for a new attribute `django_filterable` on the expression. If this attribute is present and explicitly set to `False`, the `NotSupportedError` will be raised, indicating the field is intentionally marked as non-filterable for Django's ORM purposes. If the `django_filterable` attribute is not present, the original behavior is preserved, except it also checks that the `filterable` attribute does not trigger the error if `django_filterable` is defined, allowing developers to use `filterable` as a field name without causing issues, provided they do not also define `django_filterable` as `False`.

It's important to note that this is a hypothetical solution and modifying Django's core like this could have unintended side effects. A more appropriate approach would be to avoid using reserved or potentially conflicting attribute names in model definitions or to contribute to Django's documentation or discussions to find a more general solution for handling such naming conflicts.
