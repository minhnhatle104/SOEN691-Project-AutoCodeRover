Given the constraints and the outcomes of the previous attempts, it's clear that addressing the issue requires a different approach. The problem seems to stem from a deeper interaction within Django's form and model query framework that isn't directly addressed by modifying the handling of empty submissions in `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.

Since direct modifications to handle empty submissions or to check for `union()` operations in querysets haven't resolved the issue, and considering the complexity of Django's form handling and queryset combination logic, a more foundational solution might not be achievable without a broader context or changes in Django's internal handling of these cases.

However, without the ability to directly modify Django's internal handling of `union()` querysets in form fields or without a clear indication of a misbehavior in the provided code snippets, proposing a specific code patch is challenging. The issue might not lie in a simple logic error but in the nuanced behavior of Django's form and queryset systems.

Given this, and in the absence of a clear path to a solution within the provided constraints, the best course of action would be to:

1. **Document the Behavior**: Clearly document this behavior as a known limitation or behavior in the system, providing details on when it occurs and any known workarounds.
2. **Engage with the Django Community**: Since this might be an edge case or unintended behavior in Django's handling of form submissions with `union()` querysets, reporting this issue to the Django project (e.g., via its official issue tracker) could lead to a more permanent solution or clarification. The Django developers or community might provide insights or fixes that are not apparent without a deeper understanding of the framework's internals.

Without the ability to propose a new, specific code patch that addresses the issue under the current understanding and constraints, these steps represent a pragmatic approach to dealing with complex framework behaviors that might not have a straightforward fix.
