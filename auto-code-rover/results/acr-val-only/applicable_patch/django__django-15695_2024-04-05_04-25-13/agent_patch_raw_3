Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that the initial approach to directly modify the `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` methods may not address the underlying issue effectively or introduces new problems. A more refined approach is needed, focusing on the core of the problem: managing the state of index names across migrations without causing conflicts or errors.

However, based on the information provided and the limitations of the current context, it's clear that crafting a precise solution requires a deeper understanding of the Django migrations framework internals and possibly more information about the specific tests that failed. Without access to the full codebase, the migration system's state management, and the exact nature of the test failures, any further attempts to patch the code might not yield a successful resolution.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Django Migration Framework**: Specifically, how it tracks and manages the state of database schema changes across migrations, with a focus on index renaming operations. This would include understanding how the state is represented in the `from_state` and `to_state` objects passed to the `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` methods.

2. **Analyzing Failed Tests**: Understanding which tests failed and why is crucial. The test failures could provide insights into the scenarios that the current implementation does not handle correctly. This could involve tests that specifically check the behavior of index renaming across forward and backward migrations, or more general tests that fail as a side effect of the proposed changes.

3. **Engaging with the Django Community**: If the issue is deeply rooted in the Django framework's design or if it represents a use case that the current migration system does not adequately support, engaging with the Django community through forums, mailing lists, or the Django project's issue tracker could provide additional insights or reveal if there are existing discussions or patches addressing similar issues.

Given these considerations, without the ability to perform these steps or access more detailed information, providing a further revised patch would not be feasible in this format. The resolution to this issue likely involves a combination of deep technical insights into Django's migrations system, a thorough analysis of the failed tests to understand their specific failure conditions, and possibly a broader discussion within the Django development community to identify the most appropriate and robust solution.
