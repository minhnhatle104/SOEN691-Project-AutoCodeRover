<original>        self.database_forwards(app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)</original>
<patched>        # Before calling database_forwards, ensure the index names are correctly set for re-application
        # This ensures that if database_backwards was called, the names are reset correctly
        self.new_name, self.old_name = self.old_name, self.new_name
        try:
            self.database_forwards(app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)
        finally:
            # Reset the names back after the operation to maintain state consistency
            self.new_name, self.old_name = self.old_name, self.new_name</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by adding a check before renaming an index to ensure the new index name does not already exist, which prevents the crash. Additionally, it ensures that the index names are correctly managed when `database_backwards` is called, especially before re-applying `database_forwards`, to avoid any inconsistencies that might lead to the error.
