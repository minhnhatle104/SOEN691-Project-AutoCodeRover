This patch addresses the issue by filtering out any estimators that are set to `None` before proceeding with the `fit` method in the `VotingClassifier` class. It ensures that the fitting process only attempts to fit non-`None` estimators. Additionally, it raises a `ValueError` if all estimators are found to be `None`, as at least one non-`None` estimator is required for the `VotingClassifier` to function properly. This approach prevents the `AttributeError` described in the issue from occurring.
