Explanation:
The patch introduces an early check in the `_array_converter` method to handle cases where empty lists or arrays are passed as arguments. This check is performed right at the beginning of the method to ensure that if all the input arguments (excluding the origin argument) are empty, the method returns an empty list or a list of empty lists corresponding to the expected output format. This approach avoids proceeding to the transformation steps that could trigger the `InconsistentAxisTypesError` due to incompatible inputs for WCSLIB functions. The use of `isinstance(arg, (list, np.ndarray))` ensures that the check is robust to both lists and numpy arrays, which are common data types used with Astropy's WCS transformations.
