Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more precisely, it seems that the initial approach might not have fully captured the requirements for handling empty inputs in a way that aligns with the rest of the WCS transformation logic. A more nuanced approach is required to ensure that the method behaves correctly without introducing side effects or failing tests. Let's adjust the strategy to ensure compatibility and correctness.

        # Early return for empty input arrays to prevent downstream errors
        if len(args) > 0 and all(np.asarray(a).size == 0 for a in args if isinstance(a, (list, np.ndarray))):
            empty_shape = (0,) * (len(args[0]) if isinstance(args[0], (list, np.ndarray)) else 1)
            return np.array(empty_shape)
</patched>
```

Explanation:
This revision of the patch introduces a more refined early return condition in the `_array_converter` method for cases where the input arrays are empty. The condition checks if there are any arguments and if all the arguments that are lists or numpy arrays are empty. If this condition is met, it calculates the appropriate empty shape based on the first argument's length (assuming all input arrays would have been the same length if they weren't empty) or defaults to a single dimension if the first argument isn't a list or array. This ensures that an empty numpy array with the correct shape is returned immediately, avoiding any further processing that could lead to errors. This approach is designed to be minimally invasive and maintain compatibility with the expected behavior of WCS transformations in Astropy, specifically addressing the issue with empty inputs without affecting other functionalities.
