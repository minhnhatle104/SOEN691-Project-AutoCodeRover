However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, we can draw several conclusions and outline a plan for addressing the issue described.\n\n1. **InlineModelAdmin Class**: The `InlineModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` does not currently have methods named `get_verbose_name` or `get_verbose_name_plural`. This class does, however, have `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` attributes, which are set to `None` by default. This is our primary area of interest for implementing the proposed feature.\n\n2. **Lack of Automatic Derivation**: Since there are no methods `get_verbose_name` or `get_verbose_name_plural` in the `InlineModelAdmin` class, it's clear that the automatic derivation of `verbose_name_plural` from `verbose_name` (if specified) is not implemented. This aligns with the issue description, suggesting that the current behavior relies on either the model's Meta options or defaults based on the model name.\n\n3. **Usage of `verbose_name_plural`**: The search for `verbose_name_plural` in the codebase returned 81 snippets across various files, indicating that this attribute is widely used and handled in different parts of Django, including model definitions, migrations, and admin utilities. This widespread use underscores the importance of careful implementation and testing of the proposed change to avoid unintended side effects.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n\n- **Implementing Derivation Logic**: Introduce methods in the `InlineModelAdmin` class to derive `verbose_name_plural` from `verbose_name` if the latter is specified and `verbose_name_plural` is not. This involves creating or modifying methods to handle these attributes more dynamically, considering the specified `verbose_name`.\n\n- **Updating Tests**: Since the issue description mentions that tests have been written, it's crucial to integrate these tests into the Django test suite, specifically targeting the new behavior in `InlineModelAdmin`. This ensures that the change does not break existing functionality and behaves as expected.\n\n- **Documentation**: Update the Django documentation to reflect this new behavior, ensuring developers are aware of how `verbose_name_plural` is derived from `verbose_name` for Inline classes in admin views.\n\n- **Review and Feedback**: Submit the patch for review by the Django community, paying close attention to feedback regarding potential impacts on existing projects and compatibility with the overall design philosophy of Django.\n\nThis plan aims to address the issue comprehensively, ensuring that the solution is robust, well-tested, and in line with Django's standards and practices."
