This modification addresses the issue by adding logic to derive `verbose_name_plural` from `verbose_name` if `verbose_name` is explicitly set and `verbose_name_plural` is not. This approach uses a simple pluralization rule (adding an 's' at the end) which is a common practice in English but may not cover all linguistic cases. For more complex pluralization rules, it's recommended that `verbose_name_plural` be explicitly set. This change is made in the `__init__` method of the `InlineModelAdmin` class, ensuring that the default behavior is more intuitive and reduces the need for redundant specifications by the developer.
