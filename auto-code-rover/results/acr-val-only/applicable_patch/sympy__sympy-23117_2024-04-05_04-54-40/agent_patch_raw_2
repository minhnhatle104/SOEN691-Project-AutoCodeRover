Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach might have been too specific or not fully aligned with the expected behavior of the `Array` creation process in SymPy. Let's adjust the strategy to ensure compatibility with the broader functionality of the library and correct handling of empty arrays without breaking existing functionality.

The core issue seems to be handling the case when an empty iterable (`[]`) is passed to the `Array` constructor, which should ideally result in an empty array with a consistent shape. The initial patch attempted to directly address this by checking for an empty iterable and setting the shape and `flat_list` accordingly. However, considering the feedback, a more nuanced approach might be required, especially in how the shape of an empty array is defined and utilized throughout the library.

Let's revise the patch with a focus on ensuring that the creation of an empty array does not lead to exceptions or failed tests, while also maintaining the integrity of the array's shape and other properties.

# Revised Patch:

```python
<file>sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py</file>
<original>    def _new(cls, iterable, shape, **kwargs):
        shape, flat_list = cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)
        flat_list = flatten(flat_list)
        self = object.__new__(cls)
        self._shape = shape
        self._array = list(flat_list)
        self._rank = len(shape)
        self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, shape) if shape else len(flat_list)
        return self
</original>
<patched>    def _new(cls, iterable, shape=None, **kwargs):
        if iterable == [] and shape in [None, (), []]:
            shape = (0,)
            flat_list = []
        else:
            if shape is None:
                shape = ()
            shape, flat_list = cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)
            flat_list = flatten(flat_list)
        self = object.__new__(cls)
        self._shape = shape if shape != (0,) else ()
        self._array = list(flat_list)
        self._rank = len(shape)
        self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, shape, 1) if shape else 0
        return self
</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a slightly different approach by ensuring that the `shape` is set to `(0,)` only when explicitly dealing with an empty iterable and when no shape or an empty shape is provided. This should help in creating an empty array without causing issues in the array's properties or in other parts of the library that rely on these properties. Additionally, it ensures that the `shape` is reset to `()` if it was initially set to `(0,)` to maintain consistency with the expected behavior of empty arrays in SymPy. This adjustment aims to address the issue more holistically, considering the broader implications of the patch on the library's functionality.
