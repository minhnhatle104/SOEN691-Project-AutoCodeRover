Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the previous attempts to patch the issue may have misunderstood the underlying requirements for handling empty arrays in SymPy or introduced unintended side effects. Without direct access to the test cases that failed, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure. However, we can attempt a more conservative approach that focuses solely on preventing the `ValueError` when attempting to create an empty `Array` without making assumptions about the desired shape or modifying other properties unless absolutely necessary.

The traceback provided in the issue suggests that the error occurs because the code attempts to unpack values from an empty iterable, which fails because there are no values to unpack. A minimal intervention approach would be to directly address this error by ensuring that the code does not attempt to unpack an empty iterable.

Let's attempt a simpler patch that focuses on this aspect:

# Simplified Patch:

```python
<file>sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py</file>
<original>        shape, flat_list = cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)
        flat_list = flatten(flat_list)
        self = object.__new__(cls)
        self._shape = shape
        self._array = list(flat_list)
        self._rank = len(shape)
        self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, shape) if shape else len(flat_list)
        return self
</original>
<patched>        if not iterable and shape in [None, (), []]:
            shape = ()
            flat_list = []
        else:
            shape, flat_list = cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)
            flat_list = flatten(flat_list)
        self = object.__new__(cls)
        self._shape = shape
        self._array = list(flat_list)
        self._rank = len(shape) if shape else 0
        self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, shape, 1) if shape else 0
        return self
</patched>
```

This patch takes a step back to address only the immediate cause of the `ValueError` by checking if the `iterable` is empty and `shape` is either `None`, an empty tuple, or an empty list. In such cases, it sets `shape` to an empty tuple and `flat_list` to an empty list without attempting to process them further. This should prevent the error from occurring while minimizing the impact on the rest of the library's functionality.

This approach aims to be as non-intrusive as possible, addressing only the specific error condition reported in the issue. It's important to note that without the ability to run tests or see the specific test failures, this patch is based on a best-guess analysis of the provided information and the error traceback.
