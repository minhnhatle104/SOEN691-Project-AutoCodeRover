# modification 2
```python
<file>django/forms/formsets.py</file>
<original>self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list)</original>
<patched>self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list, error_class='nonform')</patched>
```

These modifications ensure that when non-form errors are instantiated in the `BaseFormSet` class, they are done so with the `nonform` CSS class, allowing for consistent styling and differentiation from other types of errors. This addresses the issue by providing a clear way to style non-form errors in formsets, similar to how non-field errors are styled in forms.
