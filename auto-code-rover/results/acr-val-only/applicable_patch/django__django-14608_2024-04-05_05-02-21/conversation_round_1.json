This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n</issue>"

Given the description of the issue, it seems pertinent to look into the classes and methods that handle form error rendering and FormSet error handling. Here are the API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles Form error rendering to understand how the `nonfield` CSS class is currently being added to form errors.\n   - `search_class(\"ErrorList\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions adding a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, we should look into the FormSet class to understand how errors are currently being handled.\n   - `search_class(\"FormSet\")`\n\n3. To get a better understanding of how errors are rendered in FormSets and to find a suitable place to add the `nonform` CSS class, it would be useful to search for methods that deal with rendering or adding errors in the FormSet class.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"add_error\", \"FormSet\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"render\", \"FormSet\")`\n\n4. Since the issue also mentions documentation related to rendering form error messages, it might be useful to search for the documentation or code comments related to this to ensure that any changes made are also reflected in the project's documentation.\n   - `search_code(\"rendering form error messages\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how errors are currently handled and rendered in forms and FormSets, and where the `nonform` CSS class should be added to align with the existing structure for error handling and rendering."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some useful information and also some areas where the search did not yield results. Let's break down what we have:\n\n1. **ErrorList Class in django/forms/utils.py**: We found the `ErrorList` class, which is crucial for handling errors in forms. This class has several methods like `as_data()`, `as_json()`, `as_ul()`, `as_text()`, `__str__()`, and others. These methods are likely responsible for rendering errors in different formats. Since the issue mentions adding a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in `FormSets`, understanding how the `ErrorList` class works is essential. It's possible that modifications or extensions to this class or its methods could be part of the solution.\n\n2. **FormSet Class and Related Methods**: The search did not find the `FormSet` class or the `add_error` and `render` methods within it. This could mean a couple of things:\n   - The class might be named differently or not directly exposed in a way that the search API could find it.\n   - The functionality related to form sets and their error handling might be spread across different classes or modules, making it less straightforward to locate with a direct search.\n\n3. **Documentation on Rendering Form Error Messages**: The search for code or documentation related to rendering form error messages did not yield results. This might indicate that the documentation is not tagged or commented in a way that makes it easily searchable with the provided keywords, or it might be located outside of the codebase (e.g., in external documentation resources).\n\nGiven these results, here's how we can proceed to address the issue:\n\n- **ErrorList Class**: Since we have access to the `ErrorList` class, we can start by understanding how it currently adds the `nonfield` CSS class to non-field errors. This could give us a pattern to replicate for adding a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in form sets.\n\n- **FormSet Class and Error Handling**: Given that the direct search for `FormSet` and related methods did not yield results, we might need to:\n  - Look into related classes or modules that handle form sets or groupings of forms. This could involve searching for keywords like \"formset\", \"base formset\", or similar terms that might be used in the project.\n  - Review the documentation or codebase structure to identify how form sets are implemented and where their error handling is defined.\n\n- **Documentation**: To ensure that any changes made are properly documented, we might need to manually review the project's documentation structure or search for documentation files that are likely to contain information on form and form set error handling.\n\nIn summary, the next steps involve a deeper dive into the `ErrorList` class to understand and potentially extend its functionality for `FormSets`, a broader search or manual review to locate the form set implementation and its error handling, and ensuring that any changes are reflected in the project's documentation."
