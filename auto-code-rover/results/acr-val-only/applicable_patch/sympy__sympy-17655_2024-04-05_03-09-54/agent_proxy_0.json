            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `Point` class and its `__add__` method handle operations, especially with non-Point objects like the result of `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`. We also need to understand how multiplication between a `sympify` number and a `Point` object is implemented to see why the order of operations affects the outcome. Therefore, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Point\")`: This will help us understand the `Point` class's structure and any relevant methods that might be involved in the issue, especially the `__add__` method.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__add__\", \"Point\")`: This will give us direct insight into how addition is implemented for `Point` objects and might reveal why adding a `Point` to a `Mul` object fails.\n\n3. `search_method(\"__mul__\")`: Since the issue arises when a `Point` object is multiplied by a number, understanding how multiplication is implemented across the codebase, especially for `Point` objects, is crucial. This might not be confined to the `Point` class itself but could involve operator overloading in other classes or utility functions."
