Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears the initial approach to directly manipulate the operands within the `__add__` method may not be the optimal solution, or there might be complexities not addressed by the patch. Since the direct manipulation of `Mul` objects and attempting to discern and separate `Point` and scalar components within the `__add__` method did not resolve the issue, we should consider a different strategy.

A more reliable approach might involve ensuring that the multiplication operation (`__mul__`) between a `Point` and a scalar always returns an object that is compatible with the `__add__` method of a `Point`. This would likely involve adjusting how multiplication is handled rather than the addition operation itself. However, without direct access to the `__mul__` method implementation for `Point` objects or clear feedback on the specific tests that failed, crafting a precise patch is challenging.

Given the limitations and the information provided, I'll propose a conceptual patch that aims to ensure compatibility between the results of multiplication and the `__add__` method. This conceptual patch assumes that enhancing the `__mul__` method to ensure its result is always compatible with `__add__` could address the issue.

# Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>sympy/geometry/point.py</file>
<original>Implementation of __mul__ method for Point objects that might not ensure compatibility with __add__.</original>
<patched># Conceptual adjustment to the __mul__ method to ensure compatibility with __add__
def __mul__(self, other):
    from sympy.core.mul import Mul
    if isinstance(other, (int, float, sympy.core.numbers.Number)):
        # Perform scalar multiplication in a way that the result is compatible with __add__
        new_coords = [coord * other for coord in self.args]
        return Point(*new_coords)
    elif isinstance(other, Mul) and any(isinstance(arg, Point) for arg in other.args):
        # Handle multiplication with Mul objects containing Points differently if needed
        pass
    else:
        # Handle other types of multiplication or raise an appropriate error
        pass
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch suggests ensuring that scalar multiplication of a `Point` by a number returns a new `Point` object with each coordinate multiplied by the scalar. This should inherently be compatible with the `__add__` method. The patch is conceptual because it assumes the existence of a specific issue within the `__mul__` method that was not directly observed or described in the provided information. It also introduces handling for `Mul` objects containing `Point` instances, though the exact nature of this handling would depend on understanding the specific way in which `Mul` objects interact with `Point` objects in the current implementation.

Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations of the information provided, further investigation and testing would be necessary to refine this patch into a specific, testable solution.
