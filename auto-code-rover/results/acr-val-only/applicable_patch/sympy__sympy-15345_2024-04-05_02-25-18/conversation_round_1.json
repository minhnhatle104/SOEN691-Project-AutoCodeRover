        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the `search_method(\"mathematica_code\")` call, we know that the `mathematica_code` function is defined in the file `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`. This function is responsible for converting a SymPy expression into a string of Wolfram Mathematica code. The conversion process is handled by the `MCodePrinter` class, which takes the expression (`expr`) and settings as its arguments to produce the Mathematica code representation.\n\nThe issue reported is specifically with the output of the `mathematica_code` function when it is used to convert the `Max` function with arguments. The expected output for Mathematica code is `'Max[x,2]'`, but the actual output is `'Max(2, x)'`, which is not valid Mathematica syntax.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps in resolving the issue would involve looking into how the `MCodePrinter` class handles the `Max` function. Specifically, we need to understand how it formats the output and why it is using parentheses instead of square brackets, which is the correct Mathematica syntax for functions.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into the implementation of the `MCodePrinter` class and any method that might be responsible for handling the `Max` function or similar functions. This will help us identify where the incorrect formatting originates from and how we can patch it to produce the correct Mathematica code syntax."
