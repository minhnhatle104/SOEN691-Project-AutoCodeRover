Given the persistent nature of the issue and the failure of previous attempts focusing on transaction management and connection handling, it's clear that a different strategy is required. The "database is locked" error in SQLite during testing, especially with persistent databases and the `--keepdb` option, suggests that the problem might not be solvable through simple transaction or connection management within the test setup itself.

Reflecting on the nature of SQLite and its limitations in handling concurrent writes or complex transaction scenarios in a testing environment, a more effective approach might involve reevaluating the use of persistent databases for testing purposes or implementing mechanisms to serialize access to the database during test runs.

However, without the ability to directly modify the SQLite behavior or the Django testing framework's core handling of databases, we're limited in the scope of changes we can propose. Given the constraints and the information available, a direct code patch to resolve the issue might not be feasible without further insights into the Django framework's internals or the ability to change SQLite's operational parameters.

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue might involve:
- Consulting the Django project's documentation or community for known issues or workarounds specific to testing with SQLite and persistent databases.
- Considering the architecture of the tests and whether adjustments could be made to reduce the likelihood of concurrent database access that leads to locking.
- Evaluating the necessity of using the `--keepdb` option with SQLite for the tests in question, especially if it contributes to the issue.

Given these considerations and the limitations of providing a direct patch without further context or the ability to influence broader architectural decisions, it's recommended to seek additional insights from the Django community or documentation on best practices for managing SQLite databases in a test environment, particularly with the `--keepdb` option.
