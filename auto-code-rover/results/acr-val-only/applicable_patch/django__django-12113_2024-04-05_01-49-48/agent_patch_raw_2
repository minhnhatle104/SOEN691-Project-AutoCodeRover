Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, a different approach might be needed. The "database is locked" error in SQLite often stems from concurrent access patterns that SQLite cannot handle efficiently due to its file-based locking mechanism. Since the initial patch focused on transaction management without success, an alternative approach could involve ensuring that database connections are properly closed after each test setup to prevent lingering connections from locking the database.

However, it's important to note that directly manipulating connection closing in test setups can have unintended side effects, such as affecting subsequent tests that expect an open connection. This approach should be carefully tested.

This approach attempts to mitigate the "database is locked" error by explicitly closing database connections after setup operations, which could help in environments where SQLite's locking becomes a bottleneck. It's crucial to thoroughly test these changes to ensure they do not adversely affect the test suite's behavior or performance.
