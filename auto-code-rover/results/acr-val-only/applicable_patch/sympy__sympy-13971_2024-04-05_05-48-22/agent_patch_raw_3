Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be accurately formulated without more precise details on the implementation and handling of `SeqFormula` objects within the LaTeX rendering process in SymPy. The issue likely involves complex interactions between the rendering settings and the LaTeX printer's handling of sequences, which are not straightforwardly addressed without a deeper dive into the codebase.

However, considering the general nature of the problem—incorrect escaping of square brackets in LaTeX output—a conceptual approach would involve ensuring that the LaTeX printer correctly identifies and processes sequence objects (like `SeqFormula`) to avoid unnecessary escaping.

Since the provided code snippets and search results do not directly reveal the mechanism by which `SeqFormula` objects are converted to LaTeX strings, and given the limitations in identifying the exact location of the bug, I recommend the following steps for someone with access to the SymPy codebase:

1. **Review the `LatexPrinter` Class**: Specifically, look for methods that handle sequence types or have special cases for objects similar to `SeqFormula`. If such methods are found, evaluate how they handle brackets and whether they introduce escaping that leads to the issue.

2. **Examine How `SeqFormula` Objects Are Represented**: Since `SeqFormula` does not directly appear to have a custom string or LaTeX representation within the class definition, understanding how it's represented in the context of LaTeX printing is crucial. This might involve tracing how these objects are passed to the LaTeX printer and identifying any default or fallback mechanisms that handle their conversion.

3. **Adjust LaTeX Rendering Settings**: The `init_printing` function offers various settings that influence how objects are rendered in LaTeX. Experimenting with these settings, particularly those related to bracket handling or escaping, might provide a workaround or reveal more about the cause of the issue.

Without the ability to directly modify and test the SymPy codebase, these recommendations aim to guide further investigation and potential resolution of the issue by those who can apply changes and observe the outcomes directly.
