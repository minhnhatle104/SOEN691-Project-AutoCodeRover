            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `SeqFormula` class and its rendering in Jupyter notebooks work, specifically how it handles the conversion to a string format that includes square brackets. The issue mentions that the square brackets are being escaped (`\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]`), which causes problems when copying the output to a markdown cell in Jupyter.\n\nGiven this information, I will perform the following search API calls to gather more context about the implementation of `SeqFormula` and its string representation method:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SeqFormula\")`: This will help us find the class definition and understand its structure and relevant methods.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"SeqFormula\", \"__str__\")`: Since the issue is related to how the sequence is represented as a string, we'll look for a `__str__` method or similar within the `SeqFormula` class that might be responsible for generating the string representation.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"SeqFormula\", \"_print\")`: If the `__str__` method is not directly responsible, there might be a custom print method (like `_print`) used for rendering in Jupyter notebooks.\n\nThese searches should provide us with enough context to start formulating a solution to the issue."
