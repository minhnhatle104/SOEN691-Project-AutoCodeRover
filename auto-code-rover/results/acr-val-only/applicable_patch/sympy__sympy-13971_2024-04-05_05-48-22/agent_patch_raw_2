Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific part of the code where the problem occurs and based on the provided context, creating a precise patch is challenging. However, I'll provide a conceptual approach that could potentially address the issue of escaping square brackets in LaTeX representations, specifically within the context of `SeqFormula` objects in SymPy.

The issue seems to revolve around the rendering of sequences in LaTeX format, where square brackets are unnecessarily escaped, leading to incorrect rendering in Jupyter notebooks. A more targeted approach would involve ensuring that when sequences (or more specifically, `SeqFormula` objects) are converted to LaTeX strings, the square brackets are handled correctly.

Given the lack of direct evidence pointing to the exact location of the bug, I'll hypothesize a solution that involves modifying the LaTeX representation of sequences. This solution assumes that there's a mechanism or function responsible for handling the conversion of sequences to LaTeX, which might be overly escaping characters.

# Hypothetical Patch
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>...</original>
<patched># This is a conceptual patch and might not directly apply
# Assuming there's a function or part of the LatexPrinter class that handles sequences
class LatexPrinter(Printer):
    ...
    def _print_SeqFormula(self, expr):
        # Hypothetical method for handling SeqFormula objects
        elements = [self._print(element) for element in expr]
        # Joining elements with comma and enclosing in square brackets without escaping
        return '[' + ', '.join(elements) + ']'
...</patched>
```

This patch assumes the existence of a method within the `LatexPrinter` class (or a similar mechanism) specifically for handling `SeqFormula` objects. The method `_print_SeqFormula` is entirely hypothetical and serves to illustrate how one might ensure that square brackets are not escaped when converting `SeqFormula` objects to LaTeX strings. The key here is to manually construct the LaTeX string for sequences, ensuring control over the escaping of characters.

Please note, this solution is speculative and based on the assumption that the mechanism for converting sequences to LaTeX strings can be isolated and modified in this manner. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the `LatexPrinter` class (or the relevant part of SymPy responsible for LaTeX conversion) and how it interacts with `SeqFormula` objects. Further investigation and testing would be necessary to develop a working solution.
