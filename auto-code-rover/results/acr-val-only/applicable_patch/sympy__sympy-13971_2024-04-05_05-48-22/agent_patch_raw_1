Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem lies in how sequences are converted to LaTeX strings, particularly with the escaping of square brackets. However, without specific details on the erroneous behavior within the `latex` function or `init_printing` setup, we can hypothesize a general approach to address the bracket escaping issue. 

Since the direct cause and location of the bug are not explicitly identified in the provided code snippets, the following patch is a conceptual solution aimed at ensuring square brackets are not unnecessarily escaped in the LaTeX output for sequences. This solution assumes that there might be a need to adjust the `latex` function's handling of sequences or lists.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)</original>
<patched># Adjusted to check and format sequences specifically
def custom_doprint(expr, settings):
    from sympy import SeqFormula
    if isinstance(expr, SeqFormula):
        # Assuming SeqFormula to list conversion or specific handling
        # This is a placeholder for actual logic to handle SeqFormula without escaping brackets
        expr_latex = "[{}]".format(", ".join(latex(e, **settings) for e in expr))
        return expr_latex
    else:
        return LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)

return custom_doprint(expr, settings)</patched>
```

This modification introduces a hypothetical `custom_doprint` function within the `latex` function to specifically handle `SeqFormula` objects (or any sequence-like objects in SymPy that might be facing similar issues). The idea is to intercept the conversion of `SeqFormula` to LaTeX string and ensure that square brackets are handled correctly, without unnecessary escaping. 

Please note, this patch is conceptual and would require further refinement and testing to ensure it addresses the issue without introducing side effects. The actual implementation might differ based on the internal representation of `SeqFormula` objects and how they are intended to be converted to LaTeX strings.
