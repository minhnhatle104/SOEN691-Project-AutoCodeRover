Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that the initial approach to directly modify the `update_normal` method in the `Colorbar` class may not directly address the issue, especially without explicit references to `LogNorm` and the `update_bruteforce` method within the provided context. 

Since the core issue involves updating the colorbar after changing the norm instance to `LogNorm`, and considering the limitations in directly addressing `LogNorm` or `update_bruteforce`, a more general approach could be to ensure that the colorbar is fully redrawn or reinitialized upon changing the norm. This approach circumvents the specific handling of `LogNorm` by focusing on a more robust update mechanism in the colorbar that can accommodate changes in the norm more gracefully.

However, without specific details on the failure of the initial patch or the exact nature of the test failures, and given the absence of `LogNorm` and `update_bruteforce` in the provided context, proposing a new, accurate patch is challenging. 

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue might involve:
- Ensuring that all necessary properties of the colorbar are updated when the norm changes, including recalculating any derived values or states that depend on the norm.
- Investigating how the colorbar interacts with the figure and axes to ensure that changes in the norm trigger a complete and correct redraw of the colorbar.

Without the ability to directly modify or inspect the implementation of `LogNorm`, `update_bruteforce`, or the exact mechanisms by which the colorbar redraws itself in response to changes in the norm, any further patch would be speculative.

Given these constraints, the best course of action would be to:
- Review the Matplotlib documentation and source code related to `Colorbar`, `LogNorm`, and color normalization to understand the intended mechanisms for updating colorbars and handling changes in normalization.
- Engage with the Matplotlib development community or issue tracker to seek insights or report the issue if it appears to be a bug or limitation in the current Matplotlib implementation.

This scenario highlights the challenges in debugging and patching complex library behaviors without access to the full context or implementation details, especially for libraries as complex as Matplotlib.
