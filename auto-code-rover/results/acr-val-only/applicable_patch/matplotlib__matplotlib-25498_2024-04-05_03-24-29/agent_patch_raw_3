Given the constraints and the feedback, it appears that a direct and specific patch to resolve the issue cannot be accurately formulated without additional context or access to the full implementation details, especially concerning `LogNorm` and the `update_bruteforce` method. 

However, based on the general principles of how colorbars and norms are supposed to work in Matplotlib, and the nature of the issue described, I can suggest a conceptual approach that might help address similar issues. This approach involves ensuring that the colorbar is correctly updated to reflect changes in the norm, particularly when switching to a norm like `LogNorm` that has specific requirements (e.g., positive `vmin` and `vmax`).

### Conceptual Patch

Since a specific code patch cannot be provided without further context, below is a conceptual approach that developers facing similar issues might consider:

1. **Ensure Proper Norm Initialization**: Before updating the colorbar, ensure that the new norm (e.g., `LogNorm`) is properly initialized with valid `vmin` and `vmax` values that are positive and make sense in a logarithmic context.

2. **Recreate Colorbar with New Norm**: Instead of trying to update the existing colorbar in place, consider removing the existing colorbar and creating a new one with the updated norm. This approach can sometimes avoid subtle issues related to state that may not be correctly updated.

3. **Check for Colorbar and Norm Compatibility**: Ensure that the colorbar update mechanism is compatible with the type of norm being used. This might involve checking the Matplotlib documentation or source code for any known issues or limitations related to specific norms.

### Example Conceptual Code

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
import numpy as np

# Your initial setup
img = 10**np.random.normal(1, 1, size=(50, 50))
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
plot = ax.imshow(img, cmap='gray')

# Create a colorbar with the initial plot
cb = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

# Update the norm to LogNorm with valid vmin and vmax
plot.set_norm(LogNorm(vmin=img.min()+1, vmax=img.max()))

# Remove the existing colorbar
cb.remove()

# Create a new colorbar with the updated plot
cb = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

plt.show()
```

This conceptual approach focuses on ensuring that the colorbar is correctly recreated to reflect changes in the norm, specifically addressing potential issues with updating to a `LogNorm`. It's important to note that this is a general strategy and may need to be adapted based on the specific requirements and context of your application.
