This patch adds an `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class to allow instances with identical messages to be considered equal, addressing the issue described. The method first checks if the object being compared is an instance of `ValidationError`. If not, it returns `NotImplemented`. 

For the comparison logic:
- It converts the messages to sets to allow for order-independent comparison. This approach works well for simple lists of messages but does not directly handle nested structures or dictionaries (`error_dict`).
- If both instances have an `error_dict`, it compares these dictionaries directly. This is a straightforward approach, assuming that the order of keys in dictionaries does not affect equality (which is true in Python). However, this might not fully address order-independence within each value list in the dictionary. A more sophisticated approach might be needed for deep comparison if the values are lists that should also be compared without considering order.
- If `error_dict` is not present or comparison using `error_dict` is not applicable, it falls back to comparing the sets of messages.

This implementation assumes that the primary use case for comparison does not involve deeply nested structures within `error_dict`. If such cases are common, further enhancements might be necessary to recursively ensure order-independent comparison of list-like structures within the dictionaries.
