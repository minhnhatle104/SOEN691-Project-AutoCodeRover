Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's important to refine the approach, especially considering the complexity of comparing `error_dict` structures. The initial attempt might have oversimplified the comparison of `error_dict`, not accounting for potential order differences within lists that are values in the dictionary. Let's adjust the approach to ensure a more robust comparison, especially focusing on the `error_dict` and lists of messages.

```python
<file>django/core/exceptions.py</file>
<original>    def messages(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'error_dict'):
            return sum(dict(self).values(), [])
        return list(self)</original>
<patched>    def messages(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'error_dict'):
            return sum(dict(self).values(), [])
        return list(self)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, ValidationError):
            return NotImplemented
        # Deep comparison of error_dict if present
        if hasattr(self, 'error_dict') and hasattr(other, 'error_dict'):
            self_error_dict = {k: set(v) for k, v in self.error_dict.items()}
            other_error_dict = {k: set(v) for k, v in other.error_dict.items()}
            return self_error_dict == other_error_dict
        # Normalize messages to a set for order-independent comparison if error_dict is not present
        elif not hasattr(self, 'error_dict') and not hasattr(other, 'error_dict'):
            self_messages = set(self.messages)
            other_messages = set(other.messages)
            return self_messages == other_messages
        # If one has error_dict and the other does not, they are not equal
        return False</patched>
```

This revised patch introduces a more nuanced approach to comparing instances of `ValidationError`:

1. **Deep Comparison of `error_dict`**: When both instances have an `error_dict`, the method now converts the lists of messages within each dictionary value into sets for order-independent comparison. This ensures that the comparison accounts for potential differences in the order of messages within the same error category.

2. **Comparison of Message Lists**: If neither instance has an `error_dict`, the method falls back to comparing the sets of messages, as in the initial patch. This handles cases where errors are not associated with specific fields.

3. **Handling Inconsistent Structures**: The patch adds a condition to explicitly return `False` if one instance has an `error_dict` and the other does not. This addresses a potential edge case where the two instances represent fundamentally different types of validation errors (field-specific vs. non-field-specific) and should not be considered equal.

This approach aims to address the shortcomings identified in the initial patch, particularly by ensuring a more thorough and accurate comparison of `ValidationError` instances that may contain complex, nested error information.
