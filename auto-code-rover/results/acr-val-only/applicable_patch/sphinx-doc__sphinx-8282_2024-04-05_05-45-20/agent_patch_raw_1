Given the context and the issue with `autodoc_typehints` not affecting overloaded callables, a precise patch cannot be guaranteed without understanding the full scope of the Sphinx project and how it processes overloaded functions. However, based on the provided snippets and the goal to ensure `autodoc_typehints` settings are respected for overloaded callables, I can propose a conceptual approach that might address the issue or part of it.

The issue seems to revolve around the handling of function, class, and method signatures in the presence of overloaded callables. The `autodoc_typehints` setting should control how type hints are displayed, but overloaded callables might not be properly accounted for in the current logic.

### Conceptual Patch for `FunctionDocumenter.format_args`

This modification aims to ensure that when documenting overloaded functions, the `autodoc_typehints` setting is respected.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>if self.env.config.autodoc_typehints in ('none', 'description'):
    kwargs.setdefault('show_annotation', False)</original>
<patched>if self.env.config.autodoc_typehints == 'none':
    kwargs['show_annotation'] = False
elif self.env.config.autodoc_typehints == 'description' and not is_overloaded_function(self.object):
    kwargs.setdefault('show_annotation', False)</patched>
```

### Explanation
This patch modifies the `format_args` method in the `FunctionDocumenter` class to differentiate between overloaded functions and regular functions. The idea is to introduce a hypothetical `is_overloaded_function` utility function that checks if a given function object represents an overloaded function. If the function is overloaded and `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'description', the method will not automatically set `show_annotation` to `False`, allowing for more flexible handling of type hints in overloaded functions. This approach assumes the existence or the creation of an `is_overloaded_function` utility that accurately identifies overloaded functions.

### Note
The proposed patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate a potential direction for addressing the issue based on the provided context. Implementing this solution would require further adjustments and testing within the Sphinx project to ensure compatibility and effectiveness. Additionally, similar logic might need to be applied to the `ClassDocumenter` and `MethodDocumenter` classes if they are affected by the same issue with overloaded callables. The creation of the `is_overloaded_function` utility function and its integration into the Sphinx codebase would also be necessary steps for this patch to be complete.
