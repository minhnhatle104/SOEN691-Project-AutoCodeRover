**Explanation**: The original code checks for convergence and non-convergence within the same condition. However, the handling for the explicit case of reaching the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) without convergence seems to be potentially ambiguous, as it relies on the loop to exit naturally and then prints "Did not converge" after the loop. The patch separates the check for convergence from the check for reaching `max_iter` without convergence. It explicitly handles the case of non-convergence due to reaching `max_iter` by issuing a warning, setting `labels` to an array of `-1`, and setting `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty list, ensuring that the function's behavior aligns with the documented expectation when the algorithm does not converge. This change aims to address the issue where the algorithm does not return the expected values in cases of non-convergence.
