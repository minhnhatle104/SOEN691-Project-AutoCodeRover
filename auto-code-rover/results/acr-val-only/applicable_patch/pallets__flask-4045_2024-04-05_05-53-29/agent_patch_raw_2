Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach might not have addressed all aspects of the issue or introduced an unexpected problem. Let's refine the solution by ensuring it aligns more closely with the project's standards and addresses the issue comprehensively. Since the initial patch directly addressed the `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class to raise an error if the blueprint name contains a dot, the failure suggests there might be additional considerations or a more appropriate place or manner to implement this validation.

However, based on the information provided and without specific details on the test failures, the best course of action is to reiterate the importance of validating blueprint names to prevent dots, which could interfere with the functionality related to nested blueprints. Assuming the initial approach was conceptually correct but might have been problematic in execution or integration with the rest of the system, I'll adjust the patch slightly to ensure it's more in line with potential project standards or missing considerations.

Given the constraints, without further specific feedback on the nature of the test failures or additional context from the project, I'll refine the original patch with a minor adjustment, hypothesizing that the issue might require a more detailed error message or different handling that I overlooked initially.

```

This refined patch includes a more detailed error message that specifies the invalid blueprint name, potentially aiding in debugging and clarity. If the tests are failing due to reasons unrelated to the core logic of the patch (e.g., integration with other components, unexpected side effects in specific scenarios), further investigation into those specific test cases and additional context from the project would be necessary to tailor a solution that addresses the root cause of the failures.
