I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\nfrom django.utils.six import StringIO\nfrom django.utils.six.moves import input\n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\nthe serialize_db_to_string method.\n\"\"\"\ndata = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\ndef _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\ndef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n# ...\nwith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\nself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information collected from the search results, let's analyze the context and key components related to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **TransactionTestCase Class**: This class is located in `django/test/testcases.py` and is designed for writing Django tests that require database transactions. The class has a property `serialized_rollback` which, when set to `True`, triggers rollback emulation. This is relevant to the issue as the problem arises when `serialized_rollback` is enabled.\n\n2. **BaseDatabaseCreation Class**: Found in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`, this class is responsible for creating the test database and handling serialization and deserialization of the database state. It contains the methods `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string`, which are directly involved in the issue.\n\n3. **serialize_db_to_string Method**: This method serializes all data in the database into a JSON string. It's designed for test runner usage and iteratively returns every object by building a list of all apps to serialize, considering migrations and app configurations. The method uses `serializers.sort_dependencies` to order models, but as mentioned in the issue, this sorting does not account for foreign key dependencies beyond natural keys.\n\n4. **deserialize_db_from_string Method**: This method reloads the database with data from a string generated by `serialize_db_to_string`. The current implementation deserializes and saves models without wrapping the operation in a transaction, which can lead to integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references.\n\n5. **Comparison with loaddata Command**: The `loaddata` command, which is part of Django's management commands, correctly wraps data loading in a transaction. This is evident from the search result for the `handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py`, although the specific implementation details were not provided in the search results. The correct handling of transactions in `loaddata` suggests that a similar approach could be adopted for `deserialize_db_from_string` to resolve the issue.\n\nGiven this context, the proposed fix in the issue description aims to wrap the deserialization and saving of models in a transaction within the `deserialize_db_from_string` method, similar to how `loaddata` handles transactions. This should prevent integrity errors by ensuring that all models are saved within a single transaction, thus respecting foreign key constraints.\n\nTo proceed with solving the issue, the next steps would involve preparing a patch based on the proposed fix, ensuring it aligns with Django's coding standards and testing practices. Additionally, writing a deterministic test to verify the bug and the effectiveness of the patch would be crucial, as suggested in the issue description. This test could leverage the deterministic ordering of models in the app registry to reproduce the integrity error scenario and confirm its resolution post-patch."
