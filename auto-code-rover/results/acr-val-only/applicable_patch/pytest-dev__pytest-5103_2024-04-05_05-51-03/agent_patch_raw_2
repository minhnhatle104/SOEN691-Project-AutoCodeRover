Given the constraints and the goal to improve error reporting for `all` assertions without directly modifying the test cases themselves, the solution should instead focus on enhancing the assertion rewriting mechanism within the project's infrastructure. This mechanism should automatically "unroll" the iterable used in `all` to provide detailed feedback on failure, similar to what's manually achieved in the provided patch examples.

However, without direct access to the assertion rewriting mechanism's code and based on the provided context, we can conceptualize a patch that outlines how this enhancement could be approached within the project's framework. This conceptual patch would involve modifying the assertion rewriting logic to detect `all` assertions and enhance the error message by evaluating each item in the iterable individually.

# Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>internal/assertion/rewrite.py</file>  # Hypothetical file and path
<original>
# Hypothetical original code handling assertions, simplified for illustration
def rewrite_assertion(assertion):
    # Code to rewrite assertions
    pass
</original>
<patched>
# Enhanced version to handle 'all' assertions specifically
def rewrite_assertion(assertion):
    if "all(" in assertion:
        # Extract the iterable used in 'all'
        iterable_expression = extract_iterable_expression(assertion)
        
        # Generate new code that evaluates each item in the iterable individually
        # and collects failing items
        new_assertion_code = f"""
for index, item in enumerate({iterable_expression}):
    if not (item):
        raise AssertionError("Assertion failed on item at index {{index}} with value {{item}}")
        """
        
        # Replace the original assertion with the new code
        assertion = new_assertion_code
    
    # Proceed with any other assertion rewriting
    pass

def extract_iterable_expression(assertion):
    # Dummy function to illustrate extracting the iterable part of the 'all' expression
    return "iterable_expression"
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch introduces a hypothetical enhancement to an assertion rewriting mechanism. It detects assertions using `all`, extracts the iterable part of the assertion, and generates new code that evaluates each item in the iterable individually. This approach would allow failing items to be identified explicitly, improving the error message.

Please note, the actual implementation would require a thorough understanding of the project's existing assertion rewriting mechanism, including how assertions are parsed and rewritten. The `extract_iterable_expression` function is also a placeholder for the logic needed to accurately extract the iterable expression from the `all` assertion, which would likely involve parsing the assertion's syntax tree.

This conceptual approach aims to provide a direction for how the project could enhance error reporting for `all` assertions by modifying its assertion rewriting mechanism. Actual implementation details would depend on the project's specific architecture and existing codebase.
