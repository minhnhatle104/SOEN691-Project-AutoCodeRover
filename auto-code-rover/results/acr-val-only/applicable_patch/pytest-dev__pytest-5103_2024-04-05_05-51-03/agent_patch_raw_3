Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it's clear that a direct patch to the existing test cases or a hypothetical implementation of the assertion rewriting mechanism isn't feasible without access to the specific implementation details of the project's assertion rewriting system. 

The issue at hand requires enhancing the error reporting for `all` assertions by effectively "unrolling" the iterable in the assertion to provide detailed feedback on which specific element(s) caused the assertion to fail. This enhancement needs to be integrated into the project's assertion rewriting mechanism, which is a complex task that involves understanding the internal workings of the project's testing framework, likely `pytest` or a similar system.

Given the limitations in directly accessing and modifying the project's codebase, the best course of action would be to outline a general approach that could be taken to implement this feature, focusing on the conceptual steps involved in enhancing the assertion rewriting mechanism. This approach would involve:

1. **Identifying Assertions Involving `all`**: The first step is to modify the assertion rewriting mechanism to detect when an assertion involves the `all` function. This could be done through parsing the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the test code to identify `assert` statements that contain `all`.

2. **Rewriting the Assertion**: Once an assertion involving `all` is identified, the mechanism would need to rewrite this assertion to individually evaluate each element in the iterable passed to `all`. This could involve transforming the original assertion into a loop that iterates over the iterable, evaluating the condition for each element, and collecting elements that fail the condition.

3. **Enhancing the Error Message**: For any element that fails the condition, the rewritten assertion would need to generate an enhanced error message that includes details about the failing element, such as its value and its position in the iterable. This error message would then be raised instead of the generic assertion error.

4. **Testing the Enhanced Mechanism**: Finally, it would be crucial to thoroughly test the enhanced assertion rewriting mechanism to ensure that it correctly identifies assertions involving `all`, accurately rewrites them, and provides informative error messages when they fail.

Without the ability to directly modify the project's codebase, this general approach outlines the steps that would need to be taken within the project to address the issue. Implementing this feature would require a detailed understanding of the project's existing assertion rewriting mechanism and the ability to modify it to handle `all` assertions as described.
