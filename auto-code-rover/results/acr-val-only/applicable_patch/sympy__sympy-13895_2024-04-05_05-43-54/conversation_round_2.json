The issue specifically involves the simplification of an expression leading to an inequivalent result, which suggests there might be a bug or unexpected behavior in the simplification logic when dealing with expressions raised to a symbolic power.\n\nGiven this, we should look into the implementation of the `simplify` method and any related functions or classes that handle expressions involving powers or symbolic exponents. Since the issue involves symbolic computation and simplification, it's likely that the bug resides in the core symbolic manipulation components of the project.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"simplify\")`: This will help us find where the `simplify` method is defined and possibly trace back to the logic that might be causing the issue.\n2. `search_class(\"Pow\")`: Since the issue involves an expression raised to a power (`(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x`), it's relevant to look into the `Pow` class, assuming there is one, as it likely handles expressions of this form.\n3. `search_code(\"(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x\")`: This will help us find any specific handling or test cases in the codebase related to expressions similar to the one in the issue, providing insight into how these expressions are expected to be processed or simplified."

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search API calls, we have several key points to consider in addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Simplify Method**: The `simplify` method appears in multiple files across the codebase, but the most relevant ones for our issue are likely to be `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. These files are central to the simplification logic and handling of expressions in SymPy.\n\n2. **Pow Class**: The `Pow` class is defined in `sympy/core/power.py`. This class is crucial for handling expressions involving powers, like the one in the issue. The class contains methods that could potentially affect how expressions are simplified, especially methods like `_eval_expand_power_exp`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, and `_eval_simplify`. These methods might be directly involved in the simplification process that leads to the inequivalent expression.\n\n3. **Test Case in `test_numbers.py`**: The search for the code snippet `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x` led us to a test case in `sympy/core/tests/test_numbers.py` named `test_issue_13890`. This indicates that there was a specific issue related to this expression before, and the test case was likely added to ensure that the issue was resolved or to document its behavior.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps in addressing the issue would involve:\n\n- **Reviewing the Simplification Logic**: Specifically, we should look into how the `simplify` method in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` handles expressions involving powers. Understanding the logic and any special cases or optimizations applied to power expressions could reveal why the expression is being simplified to an inequivalent form.\n\n- **Examining the `Pow` Class**: Since the issue involves an expression with a power, reviewing the implementation of the `Pow` class, especially methods that might be involved in simplification or evaluation of power expressions, is crucial. This includes looking at how the class handles symbolic exponents and any transformations applied to such expressions.\n\n- **Investigating the Related Test Case**: The test case `test_issue_13890` in `sympy/core/tests/test_numbers.py` might provide insights into the expected behavior or previous issues related to the expression. Understanding the purpose of this test and the specific assertions it makes could help identify if the current issue is a regression, an edge case not previously considered, or a misunderstanding of the expected behavior.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can start to pinpoint the cause of the issue and work towards a solution."

If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n    \"\"\"\n    expr = sympify(expr)\n\n    try:\n        return expr._eval_simplify(ratio=ratio, measure=measure)\n    except AttributeError:\n        pass\n\n    original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n\n    from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n    from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n    from sympy import Sum, Product\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n        return expr\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n        if isinstance(expr, Function) and hasattr(expr, \"inverse\"):\n            if len(expr.args) == 1 and len(expr.args[0].args) == 1 and \\\n               isinstance(expr.args[0], expr.inverse(argindex=1)):\n                return simplify(expr.args[0].args[0], ratio=ratio,\n                                measure=measure, rational=rational)\n        return expr.func(*[simplify(x, ratio=ratio, measure=measure, rational=rational)\n                         for x in expr.args])\n\n    # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n    # is it a purely rational function?
