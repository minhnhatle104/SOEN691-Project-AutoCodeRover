Given the complexity of the issue, which involves the simplification process leading to an inequivalent expression, a precise patch cannot be determined without a deeper understanding of the intended behavior of the `simplify` function and the `Pow` class for all possible expressions. However, I can propose a general approach to address the issue based on the provided context.

The issue seems to arise from the simplification process, possibly due to how expressions involving powers are handled. A potential solution could involve adding a check or modification in the `simplify` function to ensure that simplifications involving powers maintain equivalence. Since the exact cause of the inequivalence is not pinpointed, this patch is speculative and aims to provide a starting point for further investigation and refinement.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>expr = hyperexpand(expr)</original>
<patched># Before applying hyperexpand, check if the expression involves powers and might lead to inequivalence
if not expr.has(Pow) or safe_to_hyperexpand(expr):
    expr = hyperexpand(expr)
else:
    # Log or handle cases where hyperexpand might lead to inequivalence
    pass</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/core/power.py</file>
<original>return self.func(b, e)</original>
<patched># Ensure that simplification of power expressions maintains equivalence
if should_simplify_exp(b, e):
    return self.func(b, simplify(e))
else:
    return self.func(b, e)</patched>
```

In the first modification, we introduce a hypothetical `safe_to_hyperexpand` function that determines whether it's safe to apply `hyperexpand` to an expression involving powers, aiming to prevent transformations that could lead to inequivalent expressions. The actual implementation of `safe_to_hyperexpand` would require a deeper analysis of when `hyperexpand` can safely be applied without altering the equivalence of expressions.

The second modification suggests adding a hypothetical `should_simplify_exp` function to the `_eval_expand_power_exp` method in the `Pow` class. This function would determine whether the exponent part of a power expression should be simplified further. The `simplify` function is conditionally applied to the exponent based on this determination. The actual logic within `should_simplify_exp` would need to be carefully designed to ensure that it accurately identifies cases where simplification maintains equivalence.

These modifications are speculative and serve as a conceptual starting point. Implementing a solution to this issue would require a detailed understanding of the `simplify` process, comprehensive testing with a wide range of expressions, and possibly adjustments to other parts of the SymPy library to ensure overall consistency and correctness.
