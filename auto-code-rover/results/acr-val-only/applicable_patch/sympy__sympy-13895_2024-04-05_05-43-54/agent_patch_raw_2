Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, it's clear that a more targeted approach is needed. The problem seems to stem from the simplification process, particularly with expressions involving powers that are simplified to an inequivalent form. A direct patch to address this specific issue might not be straightforward without a deeper dive into the logic that handles the simplification of power expressions.

However, considering the nature of the issue, a potential workaround could involve enhancing the validation or comparison mechanism within the simplification process to ensure equivalence is maintained. This approach would not directly modify the simplification logic but would add a layer to verify the output's correctness.

Since the direct modification attempts have not resolved the issue and without pinpointing the exact cause within the simplification logic, I'll propose a conceptual approach that could be refined with further investigation:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):
    expr = original_expr</original>
<patched># Enhanced equivalence check before finalizing simplification
if not is_equivalent(expr, original_expr, measure):
    expr = original_expr

def is_equivalent(new_expr, old_expr, measure_func):
    """Check if the simplified expression is equivalent to the original."""
    # This is a placeholder for an equivalence checking mechanism
    # It could involve numerical evaluation at random points, symbolic checks, or other heuristics
    # The implementation should ensure that new_expr and old_expr are equivalent within acceptable bounds
    # For now, we return True if the measure does not increase, indicating no complexity increase
    return measure_func(new_expr) <= ratio*measure_func(old_expr)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/core/power.py</file>
<original>return self.func(b, e)</original>
<patched># Placeholder for potential adjustments in power expression handling
# This adjustment is speculative and aims to highlight where changes might be needed
# Actual changes would depend on further analysis of how power expressions are simplified
return self.func(b, e)  # No change proposed at this time</patched>
```

The first modification introduces a conceptual `is_equivalent` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` that aims to provide a more robust check for equivalence between the original and simplified expressions. This function is intended to be a placeholder for a mechanism that could involve numerical evaluation at selected points, symbolic checks, or other heuristics designed to ensure that the simplification process does not produce inequivalent expressions.

The second modification acknowledges the need for a closer look at how power expressions are handled but does not propose a specific change. It highlights the area in the code (`sympy/core/power.py`) that might require adjustments based on a deeper analysis of the issue.

These modifications are conceptual and aim to provide a direction for further investigation. Implementing a solution to ensure the equivalence of simplified expressions would require a detailed understanding of the simplification logic, comprehensive testing with various expressions, and possibly the development of new mechanisms to verify equivalence.
