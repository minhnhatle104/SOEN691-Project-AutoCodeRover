It looks like django.utils.html.json_script is a good utility for that, however the JSON encoder is hardcoded to DjangoJSONEncoder. I think it would be nice to be able to pass a custom encoder class.\nBy the way, django.utils.html.json_script is not documented (only its template filter counterpart is), would it be a good thing to add to the docs?\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified the implementation details for both the `json_script` method and the `DjangoJSONEncoder` class. Let's analyze the collected context:\n\n1. **`json_script` method**: This method is found in two places within the Django codebase, but the relevant implementation for this issue is in `django/utils/html.py`. The method is responsible for escaping HTML/XML special characters in a JSON value and wrapping the result in a `<script>` tag. The JSON encoding is performed using the `DjangoJSONEncoder` class, and this is hardcoded in the method implementation. The method signature does not currently allow for specifying a custom JSON encoder.\n\n2. **`DjangoJSONEncoder` class**: Located in `django/core/serializers/json.py`, this class extends `json.JSONEncoder`. The search results don't provide the full implementation details of this class, but it's clear that it's a custom JSON encoder tailored for Django's needs. It likely includes custom serialization logic for Django model instances or other Django-specific data types.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\n- The `json_script` method currently does not support passing a custom JSON encoder, as it directly uses `DjangoJSONEncoder`.\n- To address the issue, we need to modify the `json_script` method to accept an optional encoder parameter that defaults to `DjangoJSONEncoder` if not provided. This will allow users to specify their custom JSON encoders.\n- Additionally, the issue mentions that `django.utils.html.json_script` is not documented. This suggests that, along with modifying the method, documentation should be added or updated to reflect the new functionality and to make users aware of the utility method itself.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the `json_script` method to accept a custom encoder and updating the documentation accordingly."
