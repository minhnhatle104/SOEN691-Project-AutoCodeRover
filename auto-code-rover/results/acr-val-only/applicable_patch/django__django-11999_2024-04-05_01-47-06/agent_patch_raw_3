Given the complexity of the issue and the failure of the previous attempts to resolve it through conventional workarounds, it's clear that a deeper understanding of Django's internal changes regarding method resolution from version 2.1 to 2.2+ is necessary. However, without the ability to directly inspect these changes or modify Django's internal behavior, we are limited in our approach.

Since direct modification and renaming strategies have not resolved the issue, and considering the constraints of this environment where we cannot access Django's internal changes or documentation directly, a theoretical patch would involve ensuring that any custom logic intended by overriding `get_FOO_display()` is manually applied where necessary, without relying on overriding Django's automatically generated methods.

However, given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that the previous patches did not address the root cause of the issue, which seems to be deeply tied to Django's internal method resolution and possibly changes in how models and their methods are interpreted and compiled in version 2.2+.

Without the ability to propose a new patch that could address unknown changes in Django's internals, the best course of action would be:

1. **Review Django's Release Notes**: Specifically, look for any mentions of changes to model methods, method resolution, or the model inheritance system between versions 2.1 and 2.2. This could provide clues as to why the override no longer works.

2. **Consult Django's Community and Documentation**: Engaging with the Django community through forums or the Django Users mailing list could provide insights from developers who have faced similar issues or have in-depth knowledge of the changes in version 2.2+.

3. **Debugging and Further Testing**: Implementing more detailed logging around the method call and its resolution process could help identify where the method resolution diverges from expected behavior. Additionally, creating a minimal reproducible example and testing it against both Django 2.1 and 2.2+ could help isolate the behavior change.

Given these limitations and the need for a more in-depth investigation into Django's internal changes, I cannot provide a further patch that would resolve the issue without additional context or insights into the specific changes in Django's method resolution system in version 2.2+.
