To address the issue described, we need to ensure that raising `Http404` within a path converter's `to_python` method results in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`, rather than the generic server error message. Since the `Http404` exception does not inherently communicate to the URL resolver that the path does not match and it should try the next one, we need to modify the URL resolution process to handle this exception more gracefully.

Given the context, a direct approach to patching this issue might not be straightforward without altering Django's design philosophy. However, a conceptual patch could involve catching `Http404` exceptions within the URL resolution process and treating them as signals to continue with the URL resolution, similar to how a `ValueError` might be treated in this context.

Here's a conceptual approach to such a patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/urls/resolvers.py</file>
<original>except Resolver404 as e:
    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
    if sub_tried is not None:
        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
    else:
        tried.append([pattern])</original>
<patched>except Resolver404 as e:
    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
    if sub_tried is not None:
        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
    else:
        tried.append([pattern])
except Http404:
    # Treat Http404 similar to Resolver404, indicating this path does not match; try the next one.
    # This allows custom path converters raising Http404 to signal the resolver to continue.
    pass</patched>
```

This modification catches `Http404` exceptions during the URL resolution process and treats them as a signal to continue trying other URL patterns, rather than immediately resulting in a 404 response. This approach assumes that raising `Http404` from a path converter's `to_python` method is an intentional way to indicate that the current path does not match and that the resolver should attempt to match subsequent patterns.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might require further refinement to align with Django's overall design and error handling philosophy. Additionally, changes to core components like URL resolution should be thoroughly tested to ensure they do not introduce unintended side effects.
