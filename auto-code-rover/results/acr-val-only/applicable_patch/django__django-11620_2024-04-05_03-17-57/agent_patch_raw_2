Given the constraints and the need to address the issue without causing unintended side effects or failing tests, a more nuanced approach is required. The goal is to allow `Http404` exceptions raised within a path converter's `to_python` method to be handled in a way that provides useful feedback during development (when `DEBUG` is `True`) without altering the fundamental behavior of Django's URL resolution process.

A potential solution could involve enhancing the path conversion process to allow for a custom exception that can be caught during URL resolution, signaling that the path does not match without stopping the resolution process entirely. This approach requires defining a new exception and modifying the URL resolution logic to handle this exception appropriately.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/urls/converters.py</file>
<original></original>
<patched>import uuid
from django.http import Http404

class ConverterValueError(ValueError):
    """Custom exception to signal a converter mismatch."""
    pass

class IntConverter:
    regex = '[0-9]+'

    def to_python(self, value):
        return int(value)

class StringConverter:
    regex = '[^/]+'

    def to_python(self, value):
        return value

class UUIDConverter:
    regex = '[0-9a-f]{32}|[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}'

    def to_python(self, value):
        return uuid.UUID(value)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/urls/resolvers.py</file>
<original>except Resolver404 as e:
    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
    if sub_tried is not None:
        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
    else:
        tried.append([pattern])</original>
<patched>except Resolver404 as e:
    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
    if sub_tried is not None:
        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
    else:
        tried.append([pattern])
except ConverterValueError:
    # When a ConverterValueError is caught, it indicates a conversion mismatch without halting the resolution process.
    # This allows for a more graceful handling of conversion errors, akin to the intended behavior when raising Http404 in a converter.
    pass</patched>
```

This approach introduces a `ConverterValueError` exception that can be raised from within a path converter's `to_python` method when a conversion fails in a manner that should not halt the URL resolution process. The URL resolution logic is then modified to catch this new exception and continue attempting to match other URL patterns, similar to how it handles `Resolver404` exceptions.

This solution aims to provide a clear mechanism for handling conversion mismatches within path converters without relying on the `Http404` exception, which has broader implications for HTTP response handling. It also avoids altering the existing behavior of the URL resolution process in a way that could cause tests to fail or introduce unintended side effects.
