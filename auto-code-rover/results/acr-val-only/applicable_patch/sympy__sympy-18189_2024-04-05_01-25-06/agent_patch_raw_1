**Explanation**: The original code attempts to reorder the solutions based on the `syms` parameter but does so in a way that can lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion by calling `diophantine` recursively with the same `permute` parameter. The patched version first sorts `syms` according to their order in `var` after it has been sorted. This ensures that the solutions are reordered correctly. Then, it explicitly handles the `permute` parameter by generating all signed permutations of the reordered solutions when `permute` is `True`, thus ensuring that all permutations are considered. This approach avoids the issue of incomplete results depending on the order of symbols in `syms` with `permute=True`.
