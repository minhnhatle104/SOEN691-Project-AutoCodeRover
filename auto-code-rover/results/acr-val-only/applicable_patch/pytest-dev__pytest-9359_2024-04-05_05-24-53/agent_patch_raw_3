Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it's clear that creating a specific and effective patch without direct access to the actual codebase or more detailed error messages is highly challenging. The issue seems to involve complex interactions within the testing framework, potentially related to decorators, Python version differences, and pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism. Without precise details on the implementation or the exact nature of the failure, any attempt to provide a patch would be speculative.

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue would typically involve a few key steps:

1. **Isolating the Problem**: Creating minimal, reproducible examples that demonstrate the issue without the complexity of the entire test suite or application code. This helps in pinpointing the exact cause of the problem.

2. **Reviewing Documentation and Source Code**: For both Python and pytest, especially focusing on changes between versions that could affect behavior. This might reveal known issues or changes in behavior that are relevant.

3. **Engaging with the Community**: Posting detailed descriptions of the issue, including minimal reproducible examples, on forums, issue trackers, or mailing lists related to Python and pytest. The community can often provide insights or workarounds that are not immediately obvious.

4. **Debugging and Logging**: Enhancing logging around the problem area and using debuggers to step through the test execution can reveal unexpected behaviors or interactions.

Given these approaches and the nature of our interaction, I'll provide a general guideline on how one might approach debugging and potentially patching an issue related to unexpected output in pytest error messages, without pretending to modify specific code snippets.

### General Debugging and Patching Guideline

1. **Debugging Decorators**: If a custom decorator is suspected to interfere with pytest's mechanisms, temporarily remove or simplify the decorator to see if the issue persists. This can help confirm whether the decorator is involved in the problem.

2. **Reviewing pytest Plugins**: Check if any pytest plugins are in use that might affect test discovery, execution, or reporting. Temporarily disabling plugins can help identify if a plugin is causing or contributing to the issue.

3. **Python Version Compatibility**: Run the tests under different Python versions with the same pytest version to see if the issue is consistent across versions. This can help identify if the problem is related to specific Python version behaviors.

4. **pytest Assertion Rewriting**: pytest's assertion rewriting can be disabled on a per-test basis using the `--assert=plain` option. Running tests with this option can help determine if assertion rewriting is related to the issue.

5. **Consulting Change Logs**: Review the change logs for Python and pytest for the versions in use, focusing on changes related to error reporting, assertions, and decorators. This might reveal relevant changes or known issues.

Without specific code or error messages, these guidelines aim to provide a starting point for investigating and addressing complex issues within testing environments. Actual resolution would depend on detailed analysis and testing within the specific context of the project.
