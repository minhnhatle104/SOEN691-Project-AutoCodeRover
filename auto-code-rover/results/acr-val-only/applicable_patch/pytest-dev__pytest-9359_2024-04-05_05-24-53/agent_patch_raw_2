Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details or the ability to test patches against the actual codebase, creating an applicable and effective patch is challenging. However, I'll provide a more generalized approach that could potentially address common issues related to pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and the handling of error messages, especially in the context of decorators and Python version differences.

Please note, the following is a speculative approach aimed at illustrating potential fixes based on common issues within pytest testing environments. These modifications should be considered as starting points for further investigation and testing.

### Generalized Patch Approach

The issue described involves extra code lines being printed in assertion error messages, which might be related to the interaction between pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and custom decorators or the testing environment setup in Python 3.9.

#### Potential Patch 1: Ensuring Compatibility with Assertion Rewriting

One common issue that could lead to unexpected behavior in pytest is when custom decorators interfere with pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism. This can be mitigated by explicitly marking functions with pytest's `@pytest.mark.tryfirst` to ensure that pytest's assertion rewriting takes precedence.

```python
# modification 1
<file>path/to/custom_decorator.py</file>
<original>
def t(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
</original>
<patched>
import pytest

@pytest.mark.tryfirst
def t(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
</patched>
```

#### Potential Patch 2: Adjusting Test Case to Avoid False Positives

If the issue is related to how test failures are reported, especially with dynamically generated tests or tests involving complex setups, it might be helpful to simplify or adjust the test case to ensure clear and concise error messages.

```python
# modification 2
<file>testing/acceptance_test.py</file>
<original>
def test_tee_stdio_captures_and_live_prints(pytester: Pytester) -> None:
    testpath = pytester.makepyfile(
        ...
</original>
<patched>
def test_tee_stdio_captures_and_live_prints(pytester: Pytester) -> None:
    # Simplify the test case or break it down into smaller, more focused tests
    # This is a placeholder for adjustments aimed at clarifying error messages
    testpath = pytester.makepyfile(
        ...
</patched>
```

#### Potential Patch 3: Review and Update Test Environment Setup

Differences in behavior between Python versions could also stem from the test environment setup. Ensuring that the environment is correctly configured for the specific Python and pytest versions can help avoid issues.

```python
# modification 3
<file>conftest.py or relevant setup file</file>
<original>
# Configuration and setup code for the test environment
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure compatibility with Python 3.9 and pytest version
# This might involve updating dependencies, plugins, or environment settings
# Placeholder for specific adjustments to the test environment setup
</patched>
```

These patches are speculative and aim to address common areas where issues might arise in pytest testing environments, especially concerning assertion rewriting, decorator interaction, and version compatibility. Actual implementation and testing against the specific issue described would be necessary to develop an effective solution.
