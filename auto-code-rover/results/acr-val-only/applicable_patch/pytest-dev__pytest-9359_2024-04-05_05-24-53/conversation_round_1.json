Since the problem appears to be related to the additional code line being printed in the error message when using the `t` decorator, we need to look into the implementation of this decorator and possibly how pytest handles assertion rewriting in Python 3.9 compared to Python 3.7.\n\nGiven the information provided in the issue, I will perform the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"t\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of the `t` decorator, which seems to be at the core of the issue.\n2. `search_code(\"assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\")`: This will help us find where the assertion that is causing the problem is located in the codebase, which might give us more context on how the `t` decorator is being used in conjunction with pytest's assertion mechanism.\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"test_right_statement\", \"test_statement.py\")`: This will provide details on the `test_right_statement` function within the specific file, allowing us to see if there's anything peculiar about its implementation or its interaction with the `t` decorator.\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."

        "content": "Given the results of the API calls, it appears that the `t` decorator, the specific assertion code, and the `test_statement.py` file are not found in the current codebase. This situation could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. **The `t` decorator is not part of the checked-in codebase**: It's possible that the `t` decorator is defined in a part of the code that was not committed or is generated dynamically, making it invisible to static analysis tools.\n\n2. **The assertion code and the file might be part of a new or uncommitted change**: The specific assertion causing the issue and the file `test_statement.py` might be part of changes that have not yet been committed to the repository. This would explain why the search did not yield results.\n\n3. **The issue might be environment-specific**: Since the issue is observed in Python 3.9 and not in Python 3.7, it suggests that the problem could be related to how Python 3.9 or pytest handles assertion rewriting or error reporting. The absence of the `t` decorator, specific assertion code, and the file in the search results might indicate that the issue is not with the code itself but with how it's being executed or interpreted in the specific environment.\n\nGiven these observations, the next steps could involve:\n\n- **Verifying the environment and setup**: Ensure that the environment where the issue is reproduced matches the environment described in the issue. This includes the Python version, pytest version, and any other relevant dependencies.\n\n- **Checking for dynamic code generation or inclusion**: Investigate if the `t` decorator and the `test_statement.py` file are dynamically generated or included in a way that makes them invisible to static analysis tools.\n\n- **Reviewing pytest and Python release notes**: Since the issue appears to be version-specific, reviewing the release notes for Python 3.9 and pytest around the versions mentioned might provide insights into changes that could affect assertion rewriting or error reporting.\n\n- **Creating a minimal reproducible example**: If possible, creating a minimal example that reproduces the issue without relying on the specific `t` decorator or the exact test case could help isolate the problem. This could involve creating a simple test case with an assertion and a custom decorator to see if the issue can be reproduced.\n\nWithout direct access to the `t` decorator's implementation or the specific test case causing the issue, these steps are aimed at narrowing down the potential causes and identifying areas for further investigation."
