Given the limitations in the provided context and the lack of specific details about the implementation of the `test_tee_stdio_captures_and_live_prints` function or the exact nature of the issue with extra code lines being printed in assertion error messages, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices and assumptions. This patch aims to address potential issues related to assertion rewriting and error message handling in pytest tests.

Since the actual code snippets and file paths were not provided, the following modifications are speculative and intended to illustrate how one might approach fixing an issue related to decorators affecting pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism or error reporting.

# modification 1
```python
<file>testing/acceptance_test.py</file>
<original>
def test_tee_stdio_captures_and_live_prints(pytester: Pytester) -> None:
    testpath = pytester.makepyfile(
</original>
<patched>
from pytest import fixture

@fixture
def custom_stdout_capture(pytester: Pytester):
    # Setup custom stdout capturing mechanism if needed
    pass

def test_tee_stdio_captures_and_live_prints(pytester: Pytester, custom_stdout_capture) -> None:
    testpath = pytester.makepyfile(
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/_code/code.py</file>
<original>
@traceback.setter
def traceback(self, value: Traceback) -> None:
    self._traceback = value
</original>
<patched>
@traceback.setter
def traceback(self, value: Traceback) -> None:
    # Ensure traceback modifications do not interfere with assertion rewriting
    if hasattr(value, '_raw_traceback'):
        value = value._raw_traceback
    self._traceback = value
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>src/_pytest/scope.py</file>
<original>
@total_ordering
class Scope(Enum):
</original>
<patched>
# Assuming the issue might be related to decorator handling, but without specific details,
# it's challenging to provide a direct patch. This placeholder indicates a review of
# decorator usage in relation to pytest's scope handling might be necessary.
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are speculative and based on general practices for addressing issues related to pytest's handling of assertions, stdout capturing, and potential decorator interference. Without access to specific details about the codebase, the actual issue, and the context in which it occurs, these patches are illustrative and would need to be adapted to fit the actual implementation details and requirements of the project.
