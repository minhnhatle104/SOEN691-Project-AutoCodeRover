The discrepancy between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init` is greater than 1 suggests that the issue might lie in how these methods utilize the `n_init` parameter during the fitting process or how the model's state is managed between these calls. However, without direct access to the implementations of `fit_predict` and `predict` or understanding their inheritance and interaction with `GaussianMixture`, it's challenging to specify the bug locations accurately."
