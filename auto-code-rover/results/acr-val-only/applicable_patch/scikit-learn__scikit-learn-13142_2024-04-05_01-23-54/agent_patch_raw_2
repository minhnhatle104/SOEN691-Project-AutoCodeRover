Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt at a patch, it's clear that the solution requires a more nuanced approach to ensure consistency between `fit_predict` and `predict` without altering the expected behavior of either method in scenarios outside the reported issue. The core of the problem lies in the handling of `n_init` and ensuring that the model state after fitting (including the chosen initialization) is correctly used in subsequent predictions.

A more appropriate solution would involve ensuring that the final model parameters selected after the best initialization (determined by `n_init` runs) are correctly set and used for predictions. This approach avoids storing labels directly and instead focuses on ensuring that the model state is consistent.

However, based on the initial patch attempt and the feedback, it's clear that directly modifying the behavior of `predict` or storing labels may not be the right approach, especially considering the stateless nature of prediction in scikit-learn's API design. Instead, ensuring that the model's state is correctly updated and used for predictions should resolve the inconsistency.

Given this, a revised approach would not involve directly modifying the `predict` method to check for previously stored labels but ensuring that the model state after `fit_predict` is consistent with a model state that would lead to the same predictions in `predict`.

Since the initial attempt did not resolve the issue and considering the constraints of not altering the fundamental behavior of the methods or the API design principles of scikit-learn, a detailed code patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the internal state management and initialization selection process in `GaussianMixture` and `BaseMixture`. The solution likely involves ensuring that the model parameters (`weights_`, `means_`, and `covariances_`) set after the best initialization are correctly used in subsequent predictions, but without explicit code access and further testing, a specific code patch cannot be accurately provided.

For a real-world resolution, this issue would require:
- A deeper dive into the initialization process and how the best initialization is selected and set in the model.
- Ensuring that this state is correctly reflected in predictions without requiring explicit storage of labels or altering the prediction logic to depend on the output of `fit_predict`.
- Extensive testing to ensure that the change does not affect other use cases or introduce new issues.

This scenario highlights the importance of understanding the full context and internal workings of complex machine learning model implementations, as well as the challenges in modifying them while maintaining API consistency and expected behavior across different methods.
