The code snippet related to the issue is:\n\n```python\n\"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup\nand has_change_permission\nand change\n```\n\nThe issue description suggests adding an additional check for `has_add_permission` to ensure that the \"save as new\" functionality respects the add permission as well. This is because \"save as new\" essentially creates a new record, which should require add permission.\n\nGiven the context and the issue description, the next step would be to draft a patch that incorporates this additional check into the condition for showing the \"save as new\" option. This would involve modifying the existing condition to also include `and has_add_permission` in the logic that determines the visibility of the \"save as new\" button."
