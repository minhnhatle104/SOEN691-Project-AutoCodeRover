Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AutocompleteJsonView\")`: This will help me understand where the `AutocompleteJsonView` class is defined within the project, providing insights into its current implementation and any existing methods that might be relevant to the proposed changes.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"AutocompleteJsonView\")`: By searching for the `get` method within the `AutocompleteJsonView` class, I can examine its current structure and implementation. This is crucial for understanding how the proposed `serialize_result` method would integrate with the existing code.\n\n3. `search_code(\"JsonResponse({\")`: Since the issue description mentions the use of `JsonResponse` within the `get` method, searching for this code snippet will help me find the exact location and usage pattern of `JsonResponse` in the current implementation. This is important for understanding how the results are currently being serialized and returned in the response."
