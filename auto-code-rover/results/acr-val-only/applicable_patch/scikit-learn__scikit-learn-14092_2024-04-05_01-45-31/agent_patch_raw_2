Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, it's important to reconsider the approach while maintaining compatibility and functionality. The core issue seems to be with how parameter types are validated, particularly in the context of a `GridSearchCV` where parameter types like `np.int64` for `n_components` and non-standard float types for `tol` can arise.

A more robust solution might involve not just changing the type checks but also ensuring that the parameters are cast to the expected types if they pass the broader type check. This approach ensures that the parameters are of a type that the rest of the codebase expects, potentially avoiding issues that led to test failures.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>sklearn/neighbors/nca.py</file>
<original>check_scalar(self.n_components, 'n_components', int, 1)</original>
<patched>from numbers import Integral
if isinstance(self.n_components, Integral):
    self.n_components = int(self.n_components)
else:
    raise TypeError("n_components must be an integer; got (type={})".format(type(self.n_components).__name__))
</patched>
```

# modification 2 (Revised)
```python
<file>sklearn/neighbors/nca.py</file>
<original>check_scalar(self.tol, 'tol', float, 0.)</original>
<patched>from numbers import Real
if isinstance(self.tol, Real):
    self.tol = float(self.tol)
else:
    raise TypeError("tol must be a float; got (type={})".format(type(self.tol).__name__))
</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The revised approach first checks if the parameter (`n_components` or `tol`) is an instance of the expected broader type category (`Integral` for integers, `Real` for real numbers). If the check passes, it then explicitly casts the parameter to the standard Python type (`int` or `float`). This ensures compatibility with the rest of the codebase that might expect these specific types.
- If the parameter does not pass the type check, a `TypeError` is raised with a message that clearly indicates the expected type. This approach provides clear feedback for debugging and ensures that parameter validation remains strict and informative.
- This solution aims to address the issue with `GridSearchCV` parameter types while ensuring that the parameters are correctly typed for subsequent processing, potentially avoiding the problems that led to the initial test failures.
