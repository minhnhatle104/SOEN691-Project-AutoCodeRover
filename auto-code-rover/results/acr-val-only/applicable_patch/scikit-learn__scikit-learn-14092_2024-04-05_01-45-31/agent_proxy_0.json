Specifically, we should look into the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class to understand how it checks its parameters and see if there's an existing common parameter checking tool mentioned in the issue. Additionally, investigating the parameter checking in another class, such as `LogisticRegression`, could provide insights into how parameter validation is currently implemented across different estimators. Let's start by searching for the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class and the `_check_params` method within it if available. We should also look into the `LogisticRegression` class to understand how it handles parameter validation.\n\n1. search_class(\"NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis\")\n2. search_method_in_class(\"_check_params\", \"NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis\")\n3. search_class(\"LogisticRegression\")"
