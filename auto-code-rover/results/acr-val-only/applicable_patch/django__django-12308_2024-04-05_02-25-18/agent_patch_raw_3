Given the constraints and the need to accurately address the issue without causing test failures, it's clear that the initial approach needs to be refined. Considering the nature of the problem and the structure of the Django codebase, a precise solution that directly targets the display of `JSONField` in the admin interface is required. Reflecting on the feedback and the specifics of the Django admin and `JSONField`, let's attempt a different approach.

Since the direct modification approach did not yield the desired outcome, and considering the importance of not affecting other functionalities or field types, a more nuanced solution is needed. The issue seems to stem from the way `JSONField` values are being converted (or not converted) to strings when they are displayed as readonly in the admin.

Given the limitations in directly altering the behavior for `JSONField` specifically within `display_for_field` without causing side effects, and acknowledging the previous attempts, it's clear that a direct patch might not be feasible without a deeper understanding of the Django admin's handling of readonly fields and the specific mechanisms by which `JSONField` is rendered in this context.

In real-world scenarios, this point would typically involve:

1. Revisiting the Django documentation and source code to understand the intended behavior of `display_for_field` and how it interacts with different field types, especially custom or complex fields like `JSONField`.
2. Looking into how readonly fields are rendered in the Django admin templates and whether there's a template filter or tag that could be adjusted or extended for `JSONField`.
3. Considering the creation of a custom admin widget or form field for `JSONField` that ensures proper JSON formatting when displayed as readonly, which might involve subclassing the existing `JSONField` or creating a custom display function that can be referenced in the admin.

Without the ability to execute further searches or directly interact with the Django codebase to explore these avenues, providing a specific code patch under these constraints is challenging. The solution likely involves a combination of understanding Django's form rendering in the admin, how `JSONField` is handled within forms, and potentially customizing the admin form or field display logic to ensure `JSONField` values are correctly serialized to JSON strings when displayed as readonly.
