        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, we can piece together a few key insights that will help us address the issue:\n\n1. **JSONField Classes**: There are multiple `JSONField` classes across different modules in the Django codebase. The relevant ones for this issue seem to be in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` and `django/forms/fields.py`. The issue likely pertains to the `JSONField` used in models, which is found in `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, but the `prepare_value` method found in the search results is from `django/forms/fields.py`. This method is responsible for preparing the value for the JSONField before it's rendered, which includes converting valid JSON values into a string format using `json.dumps`.\n\n2. **display_for_field Method**: The `display_for_field` method in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` is responsible for determining how different field types are displayed in the Django admin. The current implementation does not have a special case for `JSONField`, which means `JSONField` values are likely being handled by the default `else` case at the end of the method. This default handling does not convert dictionary objects into JSON strings, leading to the issue described.\n\n3. **Usage of json.dumps**: The `json.dumps` method is used in various places across the Django codebase, including within the `prepare_value` method of the `JSONField` in forms. This indicates that converting Python objects to JSON strings is a common pattern, which is precisely what's needed to address the issue with displaying `JSONField` values in the admin.\n\nGiven this context, the solution to the issue would involve modifying the `display_for_field` method to add a special case for `JSONField` that properly converts dictionary values to JSON strings. This could potentially leverage the `prepare_value` method from the `JSONField` in forms or directly use `json.dumps` to ensure the value is displayed as valid JSON in the admin interface.\n\nThe next steps would involve drafting a patch to implement this solution, ensuring that it correctly addresses the issue without introducing any side effects or regressions in the admin's display logic."

Considering the nature of the problem and the structure of the Django codebase, a precise solution that directly targets the display of `JSONField` in the admin interface is required. Reflecting on the feedback and the specifics of the Django admin and `JSONField`, let's attempt a different approach.\n\nSince the direct modification approach did not yield the desired outcome, and considering the importance of not affecting other functionalities or field types, a more nuanced solution is needed. The issue seems to stem from the way `JSONField` values are being converted (or not converted) to strings when they are displayed as readonly in the admin.\n\nGiven the limitations in directly altering the behavior for `JSONField` specifically within `display_for_field` without causing side effects, and acknowledging the previous attempts, it's clear that a direct patch might not be feasible without a deeper understanding of the Django admin's handling of readonly fields and the specific mechanisms by which `JSONField` is rendered in this context.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, this point would typically involve:\n\n1. Revisiting the Django documentation and source code to understand the intended behavior of `display_for_field` and how it interacts with different field types, especially custom or complex fields like `JSONField`.\n2. Looking into how readonly fields are rendered in the Django admin templates and whether there's a template filter or tag that could be adjusted or extended for `JSONField`.\n3. Considering the creation of a custom admin widget or form field for `JSONField` that ensures proper JSON formatting when displayed as readonly, which might involve subclassing the existing `JSONField` or creating a custom display function that can be referenced in the admin.\n\nWithout the ability to execute further searches or directly interact with the Django codebase to explore these avenues, providing a specific code patch under these constraints is challenging. The solution likely involves a combination of understanding Django's form rendering in the admin, how `JSONField` is handled within forms, and potentially customizing the admin form or field display logic to ensure `JSONField` values are correctly serialized to JSON strings when displayed as readonly."
