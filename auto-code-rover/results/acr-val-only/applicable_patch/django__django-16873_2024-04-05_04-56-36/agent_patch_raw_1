This patch modifies the `join` filter implementation to respect the `autoescape` setting for both the list items and the joining string (`arg`). Previously, `arg` was always escaped regardless of the `autoescape` setting, which contradicted the expected behavior when `autoescape` is off. With this change, if `autoescape` is off, neither the list items nor the joining string will be escaped.
