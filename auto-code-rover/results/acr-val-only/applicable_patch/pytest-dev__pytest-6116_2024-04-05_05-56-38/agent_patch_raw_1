```

This patch introduces a one-character shortcut `-C` for the `--collect-only` option in pytest. The choice of `-C` is based on the assumption that it is not already in use (as per the provided context and typical pytest options). It's important to verify that `-C` does not conflict with existing options in pytest or commonly used plugins. The help text is also updated to reflect the addition of the shortcut, making it visible to users through the command-line help.
