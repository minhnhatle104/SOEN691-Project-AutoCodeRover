This method allows for the splitting of positional arguments and handles unrecognized arguments by generating an error message. This is a crucial piece of information because any modification or addition of command-line arguments, including introducing a shortcut for `--collect-only`, would likely need to be compatible with the logic defined in this method.\n\n2. **Absence of Certain Methods**:\n   - The search did not find methods named `parse_options`, `add_options`, or `configure_options`. This suggests that pytest might not use these specific method names for configuring or adding new command-line options, or it might handle these operations within the methods we've already identified or others not directly queried.\n\n3. **Occurrences of `--collect-only`**:\n   - The search for `--collect-only` yielded 41 snippets across various files, with notable occurrences in `src/_pytest/main.py`, `testing/test_terminal.py`, `testing/test_collection.py`, and others. This widespread presence indicates that `--collect-only` is a well-integrated feature within pytest, affecting multiple aspects of its operation, from collection and configuration to testing and reporting.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps involve analyzing the specific files and code snippets where `--collect-only` is mentioned to understand how it's currently implemented and integrated into pytest's command-line argument handling. This will provide insights into where and how a one-character shortcut could be introduced without disrupting existing functionalities.\n\n- **`src/_pytest/main.py`** might contain the core logic or entry point where `--collect-only` is processed or acted upon.\n- **`testing/test_*` files** likely contain tests that verify the behavior of pytest when `--collect-only` is used, which could be useful for ensuring that introducing a shortcut does not break existing tests.\n- **`src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py`** and the `MyOptionParser` class's `parse_args` method are key to understanding how pytest's argument parsing works, providing a direct path to potentially adding a new shortcut.\n\nThe analysis of these components will guide the development of a patch to introduce a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` argument in pytest."

This indicates that the specific handling or definition of the `--collect-only` option is not located within this file. This file was initially considered because it's common for argument parsing logic to reside in such a configuration or argument parsing module. However, the absence of `--collect-only` here suggests that the option is defined elsewhere.\n\n2. **`src/_pytest/main.py`**:\n   - We found a snippet in `src/_pytest/main.py` within the `pytest_addoption` function where the `--collect-only` option is defined. This function is likely responsible for adding command-line options to pytest. The `--collect-only` option is added with two variants (`--collectonly` and `--collect-only`), and it's configured with `action=\"store_true\"`, indicating it's a boolean flag that, when present, sets a corresponding value to `True`.
