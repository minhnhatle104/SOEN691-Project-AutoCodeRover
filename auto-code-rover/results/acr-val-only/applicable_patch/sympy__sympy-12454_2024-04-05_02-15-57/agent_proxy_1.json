            "content": "- do we need more context: \n\nGiven the lack of results from the initial search queries and the inability to find the `Matrix` class or the `is_upper` method, it's clear that we need more context to proceed effectively. However, without specific class or method names, constructing precise search API calls is challenging. Instead, we can attempt more generalized searches to gather context about how matrices are handled in the project. Here are a few revised search API calls that might help:\n\n1. `search_method(\"is_upper\")`: This call is intended to find any method named `is_upper` in the codebase, regardless of the class it belongs to. It's a broader search that might help identify if the method has been moved or renamed.\n\n2. `search_code(\"matrix\")`: This broad search is aimed at finding any references to \"matrix\" in the codebase. It could help identify classes or files that deal with matrix operations, even if they are not named `Matrix`.\n\n3. `search_code(\"is_zero\")`: Since the issue description mentions the use of `is_zero` in the context of checking if a matrix is upper triangular, searching for this term might lead to relevant parts of the code that deal with similar logic or matrix properties.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\nBased on the information provided and the results of the search API calls, we do not have enough information to precisely identify the buggy files and methods. The inability to find the `Matrix` class or the `is_upper` method in the codebase means we cannot pinpoint the location of the bug without additional context or a successful search for related code."
