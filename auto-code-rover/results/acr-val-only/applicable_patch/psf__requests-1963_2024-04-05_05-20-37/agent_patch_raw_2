Given the constraints and the need to ensure that the method change from a 303 redirect is preserved through subsequent redirects, a more precise approach is required. The initial solution attempted to maintain the last modified request for subsequent iterations, but considering the feedback, a more integrated approach within the existing logic of `resolve_redirects` might be necessary.

The core issue is that the method change (e.g., POST to GET after a 303) needs to be preserved, and the original approach of copying the request at the beginning of each redirect handling iteration leads to the loss of this change. A refined patch would involve directly modifying the request object used in the loop to ensure that changes are carried forward.

However, based on the feedback that the provided patch did not resolve the issue and considering the limitations of modifying the provided code without real-time testing, a theoretical patch can be proposed to address the issue more directly within the method handling logic.

### Refined Patch Proposal

This refined approach involves directly adjusting the request method within the loop based on the redirect response code, ensuring that the method change is preserved without needing to track the last modified request separately.

```python
# modification 1
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>while resp.is_redirect:
    prepared_request = req.copy()</original>
<patched>while resp.is_redirect:
    # Instead of copying the original request each time, modify the request's method directly based on the redirect type.
    # This approach assumes the req object's method is updated in the loop, which may require additional changes to ensure compatibility.
    prepared_request = req
    if i > 0:  # Skip the first redirect to preserve the original request's integrity.
        # Handle specific redirect codes to update the method accordingly.
        if resp.status_code in (301, 302, 303) and prepared_request.method == 'POST':
            prepared_request.method = 'GET'
        # Note: This logic might need refinement based on specific redirect behavior and standards.</patched>
```

### Note
This patch is a conceptual solution aimed at directly addressing the method preservation issue across redirects. It simplifies the approach by modifying the request's method as needed without copying the request anew each time. However, this solution assumes that it's acceptable to modify the `req` object directly, which might have implications elsewhere in the code. 

Implementing this solution would require thorough testing to ensure it does not introduce regressions or violate the HTTP specification's intended behavior for redirects. Additionally, it's crucial to review all related parts of the code to ensure that direct modifications to the `req` object do not have unintended side effects.
