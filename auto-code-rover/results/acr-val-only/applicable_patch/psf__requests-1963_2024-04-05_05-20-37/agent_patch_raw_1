# modification 2
```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>prepared_request.method = method</original>

```

These modifications address the issue by ensuring that the method (e.g., GET after a 303 redirect) is preserved for subsequent redirects, rather than reverting to the original request's method. This solution keeps track of the last modified request and uses it as the basis for any further modifications needed due to subsequent redirects.
