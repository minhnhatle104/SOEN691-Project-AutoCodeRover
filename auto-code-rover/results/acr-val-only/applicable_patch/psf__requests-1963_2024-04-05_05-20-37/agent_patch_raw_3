Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the initial approach and the refined proposal did not effectively address the issue at hand. The challenge lies in ensuring that the method change induced by a 303 redirect is properly carried through to subsequent redirects, particularly when a 307 redirect should preserve the method as GET instead of reverting to POST.

Given the limitations of the previous attempts and without the ability to directly test and iterate on the code, a conceptual solution that aligns with the principles of HTTP redirection handling is proposed. This solution focuses on the fundamental issue: maintaining the correct request method across redirects, especially after a 303 See Other response.

### Conceptual Solution

The issue stems from the fact that the original request object's method is not correctly updated or preserved through the redirection process. A key insight is that the method needs to be dynamically adjusted based on the type of redirect response received, with special attention to the 303 See Other response, which specifically requires changing the method to GET, and ensuring this change persists through any subsequent redirects.

Given this, a conceptual patch would involve introducing a mechanism to track the current effective request method, which can be updated based on redirect responses and used to prepare subsequent redirected requests correctly.

### Hypothetical Patch

```python
# Hypothetical modification in requests/sessions.py within the resolve_redirects method

<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>while resp.is_redirect:
    prepared_request = req.copy()</original>
<patched>current_method = req.method  # Introduce a variable to track the current method, starting with the original request's method

while resp.is_redirect:
    # Instead of copying the original request immediately, prepare to modify the method based on redirection response
    prepared_request = req.copy()
    prepared_request.method = current_method  # Use the current method for this prepared request</patched>
```

```python
# Further down in the same resolve_redirects method, adjust the current_method based on the received redirect response

<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>if resp.status_code == codes.see_other and method != 'HEAD':
    method = 'GET'</original>
<patched>if resp.status_code == codes.see_other and current_method != 'HEAD':
    current_method = 'GET'  # Update the current method to GET for a 303 See Other response, affecting subsequent redirects</patched>
```

### Explanation

This conceptual patch introduces a `current_method` variable to track the method that should be used for the current and any subsequent redirected requests. This variable is updated based on the type of redirect response received, specifically ensuring that a 303 See Other response changes the method to GET, and this change is preserved for any further redirects.

### Note

This solution is conceptual and aims to address the core issue based on the provided information and feedback. Implementing this solution would require careful consideration of the entire redirection handling process in the `requests` library, ensuring compatibility with HTTP standards and thorough testing to validate the behavior across a wide range of redirection scenarios.
