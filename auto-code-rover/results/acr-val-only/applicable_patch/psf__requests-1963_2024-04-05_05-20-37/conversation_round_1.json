        "content": "The issue at hand involves the `Session.resolve_redirects` method within the `requests` library, specifically how it handles HTTP redirections. The core of the problem lies in how the method processes redirection responses, particularly with the HTTP status codes 303 (See Other) and 307 (Temporary Redirect).\n\n### Key Points from the Issue Description:\n- When a POST request is redirected with a 303 status code, it should be converted to a GET request. This part is handled correctly as per the HTTP/1.1 specification.\n- However, if this GET request is subsequently redirected with a 307 status code, the method should preserve the GET method. The issue arises because `resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_ request object, leading to an incorrect method (POST in this case) being used for the subsequent request after a 307 redirection.\n\n### Analysis of the `resolve_redirects` Method:\n- The method correctly identifies and changes the request method to GET when encountering a 303 status code, as long as the original method is not HEAD.\n- For 302 and 301 status codes, similar adjustments are made to change the method to GET under certain conditions.\n- The method attempts to handle various redirection scenarios, including scheme-less URLs and authorization headers, and it correctly deletes the `Content-Length` header and body for non-307 and non-308 redirects.\n- The issue likely stems from the fact that `prepared_request = req.copy()` is called at the beginning of each iteration of the while loop that processes redirects. This means that any modifications to the request method (e.g., changing POST to GET after a 303 redirect) are not preserved if another redirect occurs.\n\n### Proposed Solution:\nTo address this issue, the method for copying the request object (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) needs to be reconsidered. Instead of always copying the original request, the method should either:\n- Update the `req` object itself with the new method when a 303 redirect occurs, ensuring that subsequent redirects use the updated request method.\n- Or, maintain a reference to the last modified request object and copy from that object instead of the original request for subsequent iterations.\n\nImplementing this change requires careful consideration of how request objects are managed and modified within the `resolve_redirects` method to ensure that all other aspects of request preparation and sending are not adversely affected."
