Given the context and the issue at hand, it seems the problem might not be directly in the parsing logic itself but rather in how non-ASCII characters (like Greek letters) are handled or tokenized. Since the provided code snippets do not show explicit handling or mismanagement of such characters, the patch will focus on ensuring that Greek characters and possibly other non-ASCII characters are correctly recognized and processed throughout the parsing process. This involves ensuring that the input string is correctly handled as Unicode and that the tokenizer and subsequent processing steps correctly handle such characters.

However, without explicit errors in the provided code snippets related to the handling of Greek characters, the patch will be somewhat speculative, aiming to enhance Unicode support.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>def _from_mathematica_to_tokens(self, code: str):</original>
<patched>def _from_mathematica_to_tokens(self, code: str):
    code = str(code)  # Ensure code is treated as a Unicode string</patched>
```
This modification ensures that the input string is explicitly treated as a Unicode string, which might not be necessary depending on the Python version but serves as a clarification.

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>tokenizer = self._get_tokenizer()</original>
<patched>import re
tokenizer = self._get_tokenizer()
# Update the tokenizer regex to include Unicode character handling
self._regex_tokenizer = re.compile(r'[\\w\\d\\s]+|[^\\w\\d\\s]', re.UNICODE)</patched>
```
This modification aims to update the tokenizer's regex pattern to ensure it correctly handles Unicode characters by using the `re.UNICODE` flag, which makes `\w`, `\W`, `\b`, `\B`, `\d`, `\D`, `\s` and `\S` dependent on the Unicode character properties database. Note that this modification assumes access to modify or set `_regex_tokenizer` directly, which might not align with the actual implementation details.

# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>return self._atom_conversions.get(expr, sympify(expr))</original>
<patched>from sympy import symbols
return self._atom_conversions.get(expr, symbols(expr, cls=Dummy))</patched>
```
This modification changes the fallback mechanism in `_from_fullformlist_to_sympy` to use `symbols` with `cls=Dummy` for unrecognized expressions, which may provide better handling for symbols (including Greek letters) that are not explicitly converted. This approach allows for a more flexible handling of various symbol names, potentially including those not directly mapped in `_atom_conversions`.

Please note, these patches are speculative and aim to address potential areas where the handling of Greek characters and other non-ASCII symbols could be improved. Actual implementation and testing might reveal more specific or additional areas that require adjustment.
