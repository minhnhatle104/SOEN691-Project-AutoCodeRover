Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, a more targeted approach is needed. The issue with parsing Greek characters (and possibly others) in `parse_mathematica` likely stems from how these characters are tokenized and subsequently processed. Since the provided code snippets do not explicitly show handling for non-ASCII characters, and without direct evidence of where the breakdown occurs, a more speculative but focused patch is necessary.

Upon reevaluation, it's clear that the issue might not be directly fixable through simple modifications without a deeper understanding of how the tokenizer and the parser handle Unicode characters. However, one potential area of improvement is ensuring that all parts of the parsing process are Unicode-aware and that specific enhancements are made to handle Greek characters better.

Given this, a hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that Greek characters are correctly identified and processed as part of tokens, and that they are correctly converted into SymPy's format. This might involve adjusting the tokenizer's regular expressions to explicitly include Unicode character ranges for Greek letters and ensuring that the conversion functions handle these characters appropriately.

However, without specific code snippets that fail to handle Greek characters, providing a concrete patch is challenging. A more general approach to enhance Unicode handling could involve:

1. Ensuring all string processing is Unicode-aware.
2. Expanding regular expressions to explicitly include Unicode ranges for Greek characters.
3. Adding tests specifically for Greek characters and other non-ASCII symbols.

Since the initial patches were speculative and did not resolve the issue, and without direct access to modify the code based on real-time feedback, it's recommended to:

- Conduct a thorough review of how the tokenizer processes input strings, particularly focusing on its handling of Unicode characters.
- Investigate the conversion functions to ensure they do not inadvertently drop or misinterpret Greek characters.
- Add comprehensive unit tests that include Greek characters and other non-ASCII symbols to identify where the process breaks down.

This situation underscores the importance of having a detailed understanding of the issue's context and being able to iteratively test and refine potential solutions.
