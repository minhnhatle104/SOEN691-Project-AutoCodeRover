The error description points us towards the `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` class and its method `resolve_lookup_value`. Let's start by searching for this method within the specified class to understand its current implementation and how it handles tuples, especially named tuples.\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"resolve_lookup_value\", \"Query\")`\n\nAdditionally, since the issue mentions a problem with how named tuples are reconstructed, it might be helpful to see if there are any specific code snippets in the codebase that deal with tuple reconstruction or the handling of iterators with named tuples. However, without specific code snippets or file paths mentioned in the issue, this search might be too broad at this stage.\n\nLet's proceed with the search for the method within the class as the first step."
