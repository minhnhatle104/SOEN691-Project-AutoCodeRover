This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided code snippet from `django/db/models/sql/query.py` within the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class, we can identify the section that is likely causing the issue described in the bug report. The relevant part of the code is:\n\n```python\nelif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n    # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need\n    # to be resolved independently.\n    return type(value)(\n        self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n        for sub_value in value\n    )\n```\n\nThis section checks if the `value` is an instance of `list` or `tuple` and then attempts to reconstruct the `value` using its type. It iterates over each `sub_value` in the `value`, resolves it, and then tries to create a new instance of the `value`'s type with the resolved `sub_value`s. The issue arises when `value` is a named tuple. Named tuples expect individual arguments for each field rather than an iterator, leading to the error: `TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'`.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the way named tuples are reconstructed. Specifically, we should ensure that when `value` is a named tuple, the constructor is called with expanded arguments from the iterator rather than the iterator itself. This can be achieved by using the `*` operator to unpack the iterator into arguments.\n\nA proposed patch would involve checking if `value` is a named tuple and then handling its reconstruction differently from regular tuples or lists. Python's `collections` module provides a way to check if an object is a named tuple through `isinstance(value, typing.NamedTuple)` or by checking specific attributes that named tuples have, such as `_fields`.\n\nLet's draft a patch based on this analysis:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\ndef resolve_lookup_value(self, value, can_reuse, allow_joins):\n    if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):\n        value = value.resolve_expression(\n            self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,\n        )\n    elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n        # Check if value is a named tuple\n        if isinstance(value, tuple) and hasattr(value, '_fields'):\n            # Handle named tuple specifically by unpacking the iterator\n            return type(value)(\n                *(self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n                  for sub_value in value)\n            )\n        else:\n            # Handle regular tuples and lists\n            return type(value)(\n                self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n                for sub_value in value\n            )\n    return value\n```\n\nThis patch adds a check to determine if `value` is a named tuple by looking for the `_fields` attribute, which is specific to named tuples. If `value` is a named tuple, it reconstructs it by unpacking the iterator of resolved `sub_value`s. This should resolve the issue without affecting the handling of regular tuples and lists."
