Given the context and the nature of the issue, a direct patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of the `convert_relation` function and how the ANTLR parser is structured to handle LaTeX expressions, especially fractions. The issue lies in the handling of nested fractions and ensuring that the entire denominator in such cases is treated as a single entity, which is not evident in the provided code snippet.

However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the issue, which would involve modifying the `convert_relation` function or the logic within the ANTLR parser rules to correctly encapsulate denominators of fractions, especially when they are themselves fractions.

# Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py</file>
<original>
relation = parser.math().relation()
expr = convert_relation(relation)
</original>
<patched>
# This is a conceptual patch and may not directly apply without further context.
# The idea is to enhance the convert_relation or the parsing logic to correctly handle nested fractions.

def enhanced_convert_relation(relation):
    # Implement logic to correctly encapsulate the denominator in nested fractions
    # This might involve checking if the denominator itself is a fraction and ensuring
    # it is treated as a single entity in the resulting SymPy expression.
    pass

# Use the enhanced conversion function
expr = enhanced_convert_relation(relation)
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch suggests a direction for solving the issue by focusing on the conversion process of the LaTeX parser output to SymPy expressions. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the `convert_relation` function and possibly modifications to the ANTLR grammar rules used for parsing LaTeX expressions to ensure that nested fractions are correctly handled.
