Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be accurately provided without a deeper dive into the internal workings of the `convert_relation` function, the structure of the `relation` object, and the specific ANTLR grammar rules used for parsing LaTeX in the Sympy library. The issue at hand involves complex parsing logic that likely requires adjustments at a level of detail not accessible through the provided information.

However, addressing the issue fundamentally involves ensuring that the parsing logic correctly interprets and encapsulates nested fractions, particularly focusing on maintaining the mathematical integrity of the denominator when it is itself a complex expression. This would likely involve a nuanced adjustment to the parsing rules or the post-parsing expression conversion logic to ensure that expressions are correctly structured according to mathematical precedence rules.

Given the limitations in providing a direct code patch, I recommend the following steps for developers working on this issue:

1. **Review the ANTLR Grammar**: Start by reviewing the ANTLR grammar used for parsing LaTeX expressions. Look for how fractions are defined and ensure that the grammar correctly distinguishes between the numerator and denominator in a way that allows for nested fractions to be correctly interpreted.

2. **Examine the `convert_relation` Function**: Dive into the `convert_relation` function to understand how it interprets the parsed output from the ANTLR parser. Look for how it handles fractions and specifically how it deals with denominators that are complex expressions. There may be a need to adjust this logic to ensure that denominators are fully encapsulated as single entities.

3. **Test with Varied Expressions**: Implement unit tests that cover a wide range of fraction expressions, including deeply nested fractions, to ensure that any adjustments to the parsing logic or the `convert_relation` function correctly handle these cases.

4. **Collaborate with the Community**: Given the complexity of parsing LaTeX expressions, consider reaching out to the broader Sympy community for insights or suggestions. Other contributors may have encountered similar issues or may offer valuable perspectives on how to adjust the parsing logic.

Without the ability to directly modify and test the code, these recommendations aim to guide the next steps in addressing the parsing issue. The resolution will likely involve a combination of adjusting the parsing grammar, refining the expression conversion logic, and extensive testing to ensure that the changes correctly address the issue across a wide range of LaTeX expressions.
