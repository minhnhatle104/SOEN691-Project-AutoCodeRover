Given the limitations in directly accessing and modifying the internal logic of the `convert_relation` function or the ANTLR grammar without more specific details, an exact patch is challenging to provide. However, the issue fundamentally revolves around ensuring that the denominator of a fraction, especially when it is itself a fraction, is correctly encapsulated to maintain the intended mathematical precedence.

A more generalized approach to addressing this issue would involve ensuring that the parsing logic correctly identifies and encapsulates fractions, particularly focusing on the denominator when it is a complex expression like another fraction. This might involve adjusting the parsing rules or the logic that interprets these rules to ensure that the structure of the expression is maintained according to mathematical conventions.

Without the ability to modify the ANTLR grammar or the `convert_relation` directly based on the provided snippets, a hypothetical patch would focus on the conceptual adjustment in the parsing or conversion process. This would ideally be done by identifying where the expression tree generated by the parser is incorrectly flattening or misinterpreting the structure of nested fractions and adjusting this logic to correctly interpret and encapsulate these structures.

# Hypothetical Patch

```python
<file>sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py</file>
<original>
expr = convert_relation(relation)
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patch: Adjust the convert_relation or related parsing logic to ensure correct encapsulation of nested fractions.

def adjust_fraction_parsing(relation):
    # Pseudocode for adjusting the parsing of fractions, especially focusing on correctly encapsulating the denominator
    # This might involve traversing the relation tree to identify fraction structures and ensuring that denominators,
    # especially those that are complex expressions, are correctly encapsulated.
    # The actual implementation would depend on the structure of 'relation' and how it represents mathematical expressions.
    pass

# Assuming 'adjust_fraction_parsing' is implemented to correctly handle the issue
expr = adjust_fraction_parsing(relation)
</patched>
```

This hypothetical patch outlines a direction for addressing the parsing issue but lacks specific implementation details due to the complexity of the parsing process and the need for a deep understanding of the `relation` structure and how the ANTLR parser and `convert_relation` function interpret LaTeX expressions. The resolution of this issue would likely require a detailed examination of the parsing rules and the conversion logic to ensure that nested fractions are correctly interpreted and represented in the resulting SymPy expression.
