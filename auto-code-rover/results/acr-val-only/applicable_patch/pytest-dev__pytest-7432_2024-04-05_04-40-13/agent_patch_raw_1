This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the adjustment to the line number in the report location for skipped tests is only applied when the skip does not originate from within `src/_pytest/skipping.py` itself. This should preserve the correct reporting location for skips induced by `@pytest.mark.skip` or `skipif` while still allowing for the intended functionality of the `--runxfail` flag.
