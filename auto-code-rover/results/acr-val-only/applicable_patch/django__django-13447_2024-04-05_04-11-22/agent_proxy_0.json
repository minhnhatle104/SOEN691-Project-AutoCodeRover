Given the details in the issue, here are the API calls that would be most relevant:\n\n1. `search_method(\"_build_app_dict\")`: This call will help us understand where `_build_app_dict` is defined and used across the project, which is crucial since the issue suggests making this method public due to its usage in two views.\n\n2. `search_code(\"app_list\")`: Since the issue mentions the need to manipulate `app_list` in a custom admin view, searching for `app_list` will provide insights into how it's currently being used and manipulated across the project. This can help identify the best approach to include the model class within it."
