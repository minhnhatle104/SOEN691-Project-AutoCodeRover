Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, let's revise our approach. The failure might be due to the direct inclusion of the model class in the `app_list` context, which could have unintended consequences or compatibility issues with existing code that expects a certain structure for each item in `app_list`. Let's focus on safely exposing the model class without altering the expected structure too drastically.

<patched>    def build_app_dict(self, request, label=None):
        """
        Build the app dictionary. The optional `label` parameter filters models
        of a specific app. This method is now public to allow customization in admin views.
        """
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/contrib/admin/sites.py</file>
<original>            model_dict = {
                'name': capfirst(model._meta.verbose_name_plural),
                'object_name': model._meta.object_name,
                'perms': perms,
                'admin_url': None,
                'add_url': None,
            }</original>
<patched>            model_dict = {
                'name': capfirst(model._meta.verbose_name_plural),
                'object_name': model._meta.object_name,
                'perms': perms,
                'admin_url': None,
                'add_url': None,
                # Safely include the model class reference in a way that does not disrupt existing structure
                'model_class': f"{model._meta.app_label}.{model._meta.object_name}",
            }</patched>
```

**Explanation of Revisions**:

1. **Making `_build_app_dict` Public (Revised)**: The method `_build_app_dict` is renamed to `build_app_dict` to indicate its public availability. A docstring is added to explain the change and its purpose, ensuring that developers understand the method's intended use.

2. **Safely Including Model Class Reference**: Instead of directly including the model class in the `model_dict` (which might have caused compatibility issues), we now include a string reference to the model class in the form of `"app_label.ModelName"`. This approach maintains the structural integrity of the `app_list` context while still providing a reference to the model class. Developers can use this reference to dynamically import the model class if needed, without risking immediate compatibility issues with existing code expecting a certain dictionary structure.

This revised approach aims to address the issue while minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality or failing tests.
