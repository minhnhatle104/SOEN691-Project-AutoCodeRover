**Explanation**:

1. **Making `_build_app_dict` Public**: The method `_build_app_dict` is renamed to `build_app_dict`, removing the leading underscore to indicate that it is intended for public use. This change allows developers to call this method from outside the `AdminSite` class, facilitating customizations in the admin site.

2. **Adding Model Class to `app_list` Context**: The `model_dict` dictionary, which is part of the `app_list` context, is extended to include the model class itself. This is achieved by adding a new key-value pair `'model': model` to the dictionary. Including the model class directly in the context allows for more sophisticated manipulation and use of the model information in custom admin views.

3. **Ensuring Consistent Return Type**: The return statement of the method is slightly modified to ensure that it always returns a dictionary, even when the specified label does not exist in `app_dict`. This change enhances the method's robustness by ensuring that the calling code always receives a dictionary, potentially empty, which can be safely used without additional checks for `None` values.
