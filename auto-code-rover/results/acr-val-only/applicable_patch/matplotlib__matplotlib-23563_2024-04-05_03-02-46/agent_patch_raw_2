Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's reconsider the approach. The core of the problem seems to be the handling and initialization of the `_verts3d` attribute in the `Line3D` class, especially after changing the input data types. A more robust solution would ensure that `_verts3d` is always correctly initialized before it's accessed and that it handles data type changes gracefully.

Upon further reflection, the modifications should focus on ensuring that `_verts3d` is properly initialized in all scenarios and that the class methods are capable of handling various data types without failing. However, without the ability to run additional tests or queries, I'll refine the previous patch based on the initial analysis and common practices for handling such issues in Python.

# Revised Patch

## Modification 1: Ensuring `_verts3d` Initialization in `draw`
Instead of adding a call to `set_3d_properties` within `draw`, which might not always be appropriate depending on the state of the object, we should directly check and handle the absence of `_verts3d` more gracefully.

```python
<file>lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py</file>
<original>    def draw(self, renderer):
        xs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d
        xs, ys, zs = proj3d.proj_transform(xs3d, ys3d, zs3d, self.axes.M)
        self.set_data(xs, ys)
        super().draw(renderer)
        self.stale = False
</original>
<patched>    def draw(self, renderer):
        if hasattr(self, '_verts3d'):
            xs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d
            xs, ys, zs = proj3d.proj_transform(xs3d, ys3d, zs3d, self.axes.M)
            self.set_data(xs, ys)
            super().draw(renderer)
        else:
            # Handle the case where _verts3d is not set by not attempting to draw the line.
            pass
        self.stale = False
</patched>
```

This change ensures that if `_verts3d` is not set, the `draw` method will not attempt to access it and will skip drawing the line. This is a safer approach to prevent runtime errors, but it also means that developers need to be aware of the conditions under which `_verts3d` might not be set and address those appropriately.

## Additional Considerations
The original modifications aimed to address potential issues in `set_3d_properties` and `set_data_3d` methods. While those changes are still valid suggestions for improving the handling of input data, the failure of tests suggests that the issue might be more complex or that the modifications introduced new problems.

Without specific details on the test failures or additional insights into how `_verts3d` is used and managed across the `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` module, it's challenging to provide a more targeted patch. It would be beneficial to review test cases that failed and analyze their expectations versus the actual outcomes after applying the patch.

In practice, resolving such issues may also involve adding or improving unit tests to cover scenarios where `_verts3d` might not be initialized as expected, ensuring that any changes made do not introduce regressions or new bugs.
