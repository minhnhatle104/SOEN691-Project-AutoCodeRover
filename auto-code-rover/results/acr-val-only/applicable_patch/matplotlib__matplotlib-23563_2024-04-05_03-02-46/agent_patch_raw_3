Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial attempts at patching did not resolve the issue, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding of the core problem or an oversight in the approach to addressing the bug related to the `_verts3d` attribute in the `Line3D` class. Without direct access to test results or the ability to interact with the codebase beyond the provided snippets and descriptions, crafting a precise solution is challenging. However, I'll provide a conceptual approach that could be explored further by developers working directly on the project.

The issue at hand involves the `AttributeError` for `_verts3d` in the `Line3D` class, which suggests that there are scenarios where `_verts3d` is not properly initialized before its access in the `draw` method. A robust solution would ensure that `_verts3d` is always initialized to a valid state before any method attempts to access it. 

Given the limitations, here's a conceptual approach to address the issue:

### Conceptual Patch Approach

1. **Ensure Initialization of `_verts3d`**: Modify the `__init__` method of the `Line3D` class to ensure `_verts3d` is initialized to a default state. This could be an empty list or None, depending on how other parts of the code interact with `_verts3d`.

2. **Safeguard Access to `_verts3d`**: Before accessing `_verts3d` in the `draw` method, check if it has been properly initialized. If it hasn't, either skip the drawing logic or initialize `_verts3d` with default values to ensure the method can proceed without error.

3. **Review and Test Data Flow**: Thoroughly review how data is passed to and from `_verts3d` across the class and its methods. Ensure that there are clear pathways for data to be initialized and updated correctly. This might involve revisiting methods like `set_3d_properties` and `set_data_3d` to confirm they always leave `_verts3d` in a valid state.

4. **Enhance Error Handling and Logging**: Where appropriate, add error handling and logging to capture and inform developers of situations where `_verts3d` might not be initialized as expected. This can help identify and resolve the root causes of such issues.

### Final Note

Without the ability to directly test these approaches or refine them based on specific test failures, this conceptual approach aims to provide a direction for further investigation and resolution by the project's developers. It's crucial to closely examine the interactions and dependencies related to `_verts3d` within the `Line3D` class and to consider how changes might impact the broader functionality of the 3D plotting capabilities in matplotlib.
