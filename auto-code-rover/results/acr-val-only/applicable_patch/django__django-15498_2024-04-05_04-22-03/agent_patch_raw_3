Given the feedback and the need for a revised approach, it's clear that the initial patch did not address the core issue effectively. The handling of the `If-Modified-Since` header, especially with empty strings, needs a more nuanced solution that doesn't involve parsing the header value directly in the `_if_modified_since_passes` function. Instead, the focus should be on ensuring that the function can gracefully handle empty or null values for `if_modified_since` without attempting to parse them as dates. Let's adjust the approach to directly address the handling of empty strings and ensure compatibility with the function's logic.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/utils/cache.py</file>
<original>def _if_modified_since_passes(last_modified, if_modified_since):
    """
    Test the If-Modified-Since comparison as defined in section 3.3 of RFC 7232.
    """
    return not last_modified or last_modified > if_modified_since
</original>
<patched>def _if_modified_since_passes(last_modified, if_modified_since):
    """
    Test the If-Modified-Since comparison as defined in section 3.3 of RFC 7232.
    Improved handling for empty string for If-Modified-Since header.
    """
    # Check if if_modified_since is an empty string and return True to indicate the condition passes.
    if if_modified_since == "":
        return True

    return not last_modified or last_modified > if_modified_since
</patched>
```

This patch directly addresses the issue by checking if `if_modified_since` is an empty string before proceeding with any comparison. This approach ensures that an empty `If-Modified-Since` header does not cause the function to fail or raise an exception, aligning with the behavior described in the issue. By returning `True` when `if_modified_since` is empty, the function indicates that the condition "passes," effectively ignoring the empty header and preventing the exception from being raised. This solution focuses on the specific problem described without altering the existing logic for date comparison, thus minimizing the risk of introducing new issues.
