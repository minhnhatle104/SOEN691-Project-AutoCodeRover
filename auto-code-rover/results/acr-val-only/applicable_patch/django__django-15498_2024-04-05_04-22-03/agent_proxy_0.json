Given the information provided in the issue, I will start by searching for code snippets and methods that are likely involved in handling this header. \n\n1. Since the issue mentions an exception being raised when the `If-Modified-Since` header is an empty string, it's crucial to find where this header is being parsed or evaluated. I will search for code snippets that reference this specific header.\n\n2. The issue also references a specific commit `d6aff369ad3`. While I can't directly search by commit in this simulated environment, it indicates a recent change that might be located in a method that deals with HTTP headers or date parsing.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"If-Modified-Since\")`: This will help identify where in the codebase the `If-Modified-Since` header is being referenced or handled.\n- `search_method(\"parse_date\")`: Assuming that the handling of the `If-Modified-Since` header involves parsing its value as a date, this search will help identify methods that might be involved in this process and could be the source of the issue."
