Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue, let's reconsider the approach. The primary goal is to ensure that nullable pandas dtypes are correctly handled by the `unique_labels` function without causing errors. Since the direct modification approach did not yield the desired outcome, we might need to focus on ensuring compatibility at a higher level, particularly in how data types are interpreted and processed within `unique_labels`.

A more robust approach could involve adding a preprocessing step within `unique_labels` to detect and convert nullable pandas dtypes to their closest numpy or non-nullable pandas equivalents before any processing. This ensures that the existing logic for type handling and unique label extraction remains effective without requiring extensive modifications to type detection and handling logic.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/utils/multiclass.py</file>
<original>if not ys:
    raise ValueError("No argument has been passed.")</original>
<patched>import pandas as pd

# Preprocess input to convert nullable pandas dtypes to their numpy equivalents
def _convert_nullable_pd_types(y):
    """Convert nullable pandas dtypes to their numpy equivalents."""
    if isinstance(y, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(y.dtype):
        return y.astype('float64' if y.isnull().any() else 'int64')
    elif isinstance(y, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_float_dtype(y.dtype):
        return y.astype('float64')
    elif isinstance(y, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype(y.dtype):
        return y.astype('object')
    return y

ys = tuple(_convert_nullable_pd_types(y) for y in ys)

if not ys:
    raise ValueError("No argument has been passed.")</patched>
```

This modification introduces a preprocessing function `_convert_nullable_pd_types` within the `unique_labels` function. This function checks each input series for nullable pandas dtypes and converts them to the closest numpy or non-nullable pandas equivalents. Specifically:
- Nullable integer series with any null values are converted to `float64` to preserve the null information, otherwise to `int64`.
- Nullable float series are directly converted to `float64`.
- Nullable boolean series are converted to `object` to preserve true, false, and null states.

This approach aims to maintain the integrity of the data while ensuring compatibility with the existing logic in `unique_labels` for type handling and unique label extraction. By converting the data types upfront, we avoid the complications that arise from the `type_of_target` function misinterpreting the nullable pandas dtypes as `object`, which was leading to errors.
