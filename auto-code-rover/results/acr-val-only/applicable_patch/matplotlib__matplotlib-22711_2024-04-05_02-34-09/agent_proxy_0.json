Given the details of the issue, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the `RangeSlider` class**: This will help us understand the class's structure, methods, and how `set_val` fits within it.\n   - `search_class(\"RangeSlider\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `set_val` method within the `RangeSlider` class**: Since the issue is directly related to this method, understanding its implementation and any related comments or documentation will be crucial.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_val\", \"RangeSlider\")`\n\n3. **Search for the problematic code snippet in the file**: The issue mentions a specific line of code (`xy[4] = .25, val[0]`) that seems to be causing the problem. Searching for this snippet will help us understand its context and why it might be problematic.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"xy[4] = .25, val[0]\", \"/matplotlib/widgets.py\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem and assist in formulating a solution."
