This modification ensures that the polygon (`self.poly.xy`) representing the slider is correctly closed by connecting the last point to the first, rather than attempting to set it to a specific value which was causing the `IndexError`. This approach maintains the integrity of the polygon shape for both vertical and horizontal orientations of the `RangeSlider`.
