This patch modifies the handling of `CompoundModel` instances within the `_separable` function. It introduces a special case for logical AND ('&') and OR ('|') operations, which are common in compound models. By combining the separability matrices of the left and right models element-wise for these operations, the patch aims to correctly reflect the separability of nested compound models. This approach is based on the assumption that '&' and '|' are the primary operations used to combine models in a way that would affect their separability in the context described in the issue. For other operations, the existing logic is preserved. This solution might need further refinement based on a comprehensive understanding of all possible operations and their impact on model separability.
