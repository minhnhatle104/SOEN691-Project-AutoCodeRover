        "content": "Analyzing the provided context from the `coth` class and its `eval` method within the `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` file, we can identify several key points relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The `coth` class is a subclass of `HyperbolicFunction`, which likely means it inherits or shares common functionality with other hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, etc. It contains several methods, including `eval`, which is of particular interest.\n\n2. **`eval` Method**: This method is responsible for evaluating the `coth` function under various conditions. It handles special cases such as when the argument is a number (`is_Number`), infinity (`S.Infinity`, `S.NegativeInfinity`), zero (`S.Zero`), or complex infinity (`S.ComplexInfinity`). It also deals with arguments that are additions (`is_Add`), or inverse hyperbolic functions (`asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`, `acoth`).\n\n3. **Error Location**: The error mentioned in the issue occurs in a block of code within the `eval` method that handles cases where the argument is an addition (`arg.is_Add`). Specifically, the error arises from a conditional check `if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:`. This line references a variable `cotm` that is not defined anywhere in the provided code snippet. The intended variable is likely `cothm`, which is defined in the line above as `cothm = coth(m)`.\n\n4. **Potential Solution**: The error seems to be a simple typo where `cotm` was mistakenly used instead of `cothm`. Correcting this typo should resolve the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to prepare a patch to fix the typo in the `eval` method of the `coth` class. The patch would correct the variable name from `cotm` to `cothm` in the conditional check that currently causes the `NameError`. This change should allow the method to correctly handle the cases where the argument is an addition and involves the `coth` function, thus resolving the errors encountered for certain integral values."
