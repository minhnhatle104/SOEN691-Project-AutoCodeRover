The error message points to a specific line in the `hyperbolic.py` file, related to the `coth` function and possibly its evaluation method `eval`. The mention of `cotm is S.ComplexInfinity` suggests there might be a typo or an undefined variable being referenced.\n\nLet's start by investigating the `coth` class and the `eval` method within the `hyperbolic.py` file to understand how they are implemented and to find the exact location of the error:\n\n1. Search for the `coth` class to understand its structure and methods.\n2. Search for the `eval` method within the `coth` class to see how it's implemented and to locate the line causing the error.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_class(\"coth\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"eval\", \"coth\")"
