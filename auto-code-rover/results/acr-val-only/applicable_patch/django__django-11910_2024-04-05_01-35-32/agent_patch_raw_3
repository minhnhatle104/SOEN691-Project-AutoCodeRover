Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it appears a direct patch to the provided model code snippets may not address the core issue, especially since the problem seems to be rooted in the migration process rather than the model definitions themselves. The issue revolves around the `ForeignKey`'s `to_field` parameter not being updated correctly after a primary key has been renamed, which is a process handled in Django's migration files rather than in the model files directly.

Since the original and patched code snippets provided earlier did not directly resolve the issue and considering the nature of the problem as described, it's clear that a direct code patch to the models as provided isn't the correct approach to resolving this issue. Instead, the resolution likely lies within the migration files, which were not provided.

However, to address the issue based on the description and the constraints, I'll offer a conceptual approach to what the migration patch might look like, acknowledging that without access to the specific migration files, this remains a hypothetical solution.

# Conceptual Migration Patch
This conceptual patch is intended to illustrate the approach you might take within your Django migration files to ensure that the `to_field` parameter of a `ForeignKey` is correctly updated following the renaming of a primary key field.

```python
# Hypothetical migration file adjustment
<file>migrations/XXXX_correct_fk_to_field.py</file>
<original>
# This section is conceptual and assumes the existence of a migration step that incorrectly references 'field_wrong'
migrations.AlterField(
    model_name='modelb',
    name='field_fk',
    field=models.ForeignKey(to='app1.ModelA', to_field='field_wrong', on_delete=models.CASCADE),
)
</original>
<patched>
# Corrected migration step to reference 'field_fixed' as the 'to_field' after the primary key has been renamed
migrations.AlterField(
    model_name='modelb',
    name='field_fk',
    field=models.ForeignKey(to='app1.ModelA', to_field='field_fixed', on_delete=models.CASCADE),
)
</patched>
```

**Key Points**:
- This patch is conceptual and assumes the existence of a specific migration operation that needs to be corrected.
- The `to_field` parameter in the `ForeignKey` definition within `ModelB` should be updated to match the new name of the primary key field in `ModelA` (`field_fixed`), following its renaming.
- Actual migration file names (`XXXX_correct_fk_to_field.py`) and migration steps would vary based on your project's specific migration history and structure.

**Recommendation**:
- Review your project's migration files for `ModelA` and `ModelB`, especially focusing on those migrations that involve renaming the primary key field in `ModelA` and any related adjustments to `ForeignKey` fields in `ModelB`.
- Ensure that all references to the renamed field are correctly updated in subsequent migrations, particularly in `ForeignKey` definitions that specify a `to_field` parameter.

Remember, migration issues can be complex and may affect your database's integrity. Always backup your database before applying migration changes, and test your migrations in a development environment to ensure they behave as expected.
