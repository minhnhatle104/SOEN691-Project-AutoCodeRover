Given the initial issue description and the context provided, it seems the core problem lies in the handling of ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter not being correctly updated after a primary key has been renamed. However, the provided code snippets and subsequent clarifications did not directly address the `to_field` parameter or the renaming operation in migrations. 

Given this, let's construct a hypothetical patch that would address a potential issue in the migration files, as the problem seems to be related to the migration process rather than the model definitions themselves. Since I can't directly access the migration files or their content, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate how you might correct the `to_field` parameter in a ForeignKey after a primary key has been renamed.

# Hypothetical Migration Modification
```python
<file>migrations/XXXX_rename_field_in_modela.py</file>
<original>migrations.RenameField(
    model_name='modela',
    old_name='field_wrong',
    new_name='field_fixed',
),
migrations.AlterField(
    model_name='modelb',
    name='field_fk',
    field=models.ForeignKey(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE, to='app1.ModelA', to_field='field_wrong'),
)</original>
<patched>migrations.RenameField(
    model_name='modela',
    old_name='field_wrong',
    new_name='field_fixed',
),
# Ensure the ForeignKey in ModelB points to the new field name in ModelA
migrations.AlterField(
    model_name='modelb',
    name='field_fk',
    field=models.ForeignKey(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE, to='app1.ModelA', to_field='field_fixed'),
)</patched>
```

**Explanation**:
- This hypothetical patch assumes there's a migration file responsible for renaming a field in `ModelA` and subsequently updating a ForeignKey in `ModelB` to reflect this change.
- The original migration snippet incorrectly attempts to alter `ModelB`'s ForeignKey to still point to the old field name (`field_wrong`) in `ModelA`.
- The patched version corrects this by updating the `to_field` parameter to point to the new field name (`field_fixed`) in `ModelA`, ensuring that the ForeignKey relationship remains consistent and accurate after the field renaming.

**Important Notes**:
- This patch is speculative and constructed based on the issue description. The actual migration file names, model names, and field names might differ in your project.
- If the issue persists after applying a similar patch, consider reviewing all related migration files for consistency and ensuring that all migrations are applied correctly in your development and testing environments.
- Always test migration changes in a safe, controlled environment before applying them to production databases to prevent data loss or integrity issues.
