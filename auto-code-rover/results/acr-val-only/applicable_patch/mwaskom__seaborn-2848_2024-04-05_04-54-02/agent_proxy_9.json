            "content": "As I'm unable to directly execute or modify search API calls in this environment, I'll provide guidance on what would be the correct approach to formulating search API calls based on the initial scenario description. This guidance is meant to illustrate how one might proceed if they had the capability to execute these calls in a development environment with access to a codebase search tool or API.\n\nGiven the issue with seaborn's `PairGrid` and `scatterplot` functions, particularly regarding the handling of the `hue` parameter that leads to errors in version 0.11.1 but not in version 0.11.0, here are the corrected or refined search API calls that would be appropriate to further investigate the issue:\n\n1. **Search for Changes in `PairGrid` Class Implementation**:\n   - To check if there were any changes in the `PairGrid` class that might affect how `hue` is handled:\n     ```\n     search_class(\"PairGrid\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Search for Changes in `scatterplot` Function Implementation**:\n   - To investigate any modifications to the `scatterplot` function that could impact the handling of `hue`:\n     ```\n     search_method(\"scatterplot\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Search for the Implementation of `hue` Handling**:\n   - Since the error involves the handling of the `hue` parameter, specifically with categorical data, it would be useful to understand how `hue` is processed:\n     ```\n     search_code(\"hue_norm\")\n     ```\n\n4. **Direct Search for Error Messages**:\n   - To find potential discussions or fixes related to the error, searching for the error message or its key parts could be helpful:\n     ```\n     search_code(\"TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable\")\n     search_code(\"KeyError: 'setosa'\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Search for Documentation or Comments Regarding Version Changes**:\n   - To identify specific changes between versions 0.11.0 and 0.11.1 that might relate to the issue:\n     ```\n     search_code(\"version 0.11.1\")\n     search_code(\"version 0.11.0\")\n     ```\n\nThese hypothetical API calls are designed based on the assumption of having access to a searchable codebase or documentation resource that could process such queries. In a real-world scenario, developers might use version control systems, code search tools, or documentation search features to perform similar investigations to understand the cause of a bug and how to address it."
