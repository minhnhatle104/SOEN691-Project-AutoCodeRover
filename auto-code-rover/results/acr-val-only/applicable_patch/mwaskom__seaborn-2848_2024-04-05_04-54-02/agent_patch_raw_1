Given the limitations of this environment and the lack of direct access to the seaborn library's codebase for debugging, I'll propose a hypothetical patch based on the analysis and the context retrieved. This patch aims to address the issue by ensuring that the `hue` parameter is correctly handled when passed through the `PairGrid.map` method to the `scatterplot` function, particularly focusing on maintaining compatibility with categorical `hue` data.

Please note, this is a conceptual solution and might require adjustments to fit into the actual seaborn codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>seaborn/axisgrid.py</file>
<original>
def map(self, func, **kwargs):
    row_indices, col_indices = np.indices(self.axes.shape)
    indices = zip(row_indices.flat, col_indices.flat)
    self._map_bivariate(func, indices, **kwargs)

    return self
</original>
<patched>
def map(self, func, **kwargs):
    # Check if 'hue' is in kwargs and if it's a Series or similar, convert it to list to ensure compatibility
    if 'hue' in kwargs and hasattr(kwargs['hue'], 'tolist'):
        kwargs['hue'] = kwargs['hue'].tolist()
    
    row_indices, col_indices = np.indices(self.axes.shape)
    indices = zip(row_indices.flat, col_indices.flat)
    self._map_bivariate(func, indices, **kwargs)

    return self
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>seaborn/relational.py</file>
<original>
p.map_hue(palette=palette, order=hue_order, norm=hue_norm)
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure hue_norm is not None before mapping
if hue_norm is not None:
    p.map_hue(palette=palette, order=hue_order, norm=hue_norm)
else:
    # Apply a default normalization if hue_norm is not explicitly provided
    p.map_hue(palette=palette, order=hue_order, norm=plt.Normalize())
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address potential issues with the handling of the `hue` parameter when passed from `PairGrid.map` to `scatterplot`. The first modification ensures that `hue` data, if passed as a pandas Series or similar, is converted to a list, which might help avoid issues related to data type compatibility. The second modification adds a safeguard to ensure that `hue_norm` is not `None` before it's used, providing a default normalization if necessary. 

Remember, these patches are hypothetical and would need testing and validation within the seaborn development environment.
