Given the constraints of this environment and the feedback received, it's clear that providing a direct and actionable patch to resolve the issue without access to test results, the ability to execute code, or more detailed error messages from the tests that failed is challenging. My previous responses were conceptual and based on the analysis of the provided context, aiming to address the issue with the information available.

However, since we've encountered limitations in resolving the issue through hypothetical patches, and without the ability to directly interact with the seaborn codebase or the development environment, I recommend the following steps for those who can access the necessary resources:

1. **Direct Debugging**: Use a debugging tool to step through the execution of the `PairGrid.map` method and the `scatterplot` function call. Pay close attention to how the `hue` parameter is handled and look for any discrepancies in its expected vs. actual handling.

2. **Review Recent Changes**: Examine the commit history between seaborn versions 0.11.0 and 0.11.1, focusing on changes related to `PairGrid`, `scatterplot`, and the handling of the `hue` parameter. This could provide insights into what might have introduced the issue.

3. **Engage with the Community**: If the issue persists, consider opening an issue on the seaborn GitHub repository or searching the issue tracker for similar reports. The seaborn developer community can offer valuable insights and may have encountered and addressed similar issues.

4. **Manual Patch Testing**: For those with the ability to modify the seaborn codebase, consider manually implementing and testing the conceptual patches provided earlier, with adjustments based on the specific error messages and test failures encountered. This process may involve iteratively modifying the patches based on test results.

5. **Collaboration**: Collaborate with other developers or contributors to the seaborn project. Collaborative debugging and patch development can often lead to more effective solutions, especially for complex issues involving data visualization and library interactions.

I hope these recommendations provide a pathway toward resolving the issue for those with the necessary access and resources.
