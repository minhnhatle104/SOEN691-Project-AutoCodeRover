Given the feedback, it seems the direct modification approach within the `ccode` function to handle the `sinc` function specifically did not work as expected. A more appropriate approach might be to extend the `CCodePrinter` class itself to include a method for handling the `sinc` function, which aligns better with the design philosophy of extending functionality through class inheritance and method overriding. This approach would not only resolve the issue but also keep the modifications more organized and maintainable.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/ccode.py</file>
<original>class CCodePrinter(CodePrinter):
    \"\"\"A printer to convert python expressions to strings of c code\"\"\"
    printmethod = \"_ccode\"
    language = \"C\"
    ...
</original>
<patched>class CCodePrinter(CodePrinter):
    \"\"\"A printer to convert python expressions to strings of c code\"\"\"
    printmethod = \"_ccode\"
    language = \"C\"

    def _print_sinc(self, expr):
        from sympy import sin
        x = expr.args[0]
        return \"((%s != 0) ? (sin(%s)/%s) : (1))\" % (self._print(x), self._print(x), self._print(x))

    ...
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/ccode.py</file>
<original>def _print_Function(self, expr):
        ...
</original>
<patched>def _print_Function(self, expr):
        from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import sinc
        if isinstance(expr, sinc):
            return self._print_sinc(expr)
        ...
</patched>
```

These modifications extend the `CCodePrinter` class to specifically handle the `sinc` function by adding a new method `_print_sinc` that outputs the C code for the `sinc` function as a piecewise expression directly. This approach avoids altering the core functionality of the `ccode` function and instead leverages the existing framework for handling specific function types. The second modification ensures that when the `CCodePrinter` encounters a `sinc` function, it delegates the printing to the newly added `_print_sinc` method.
