Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's consider a different approach to address the problem. The issue seems to stem from the fact that the same template tag library is being identified multiple times, potentially due to how libraries are added to the `libraries` dictionary. A more precise solution would ensure that each library is only considered once per unique path, avoiding false positives for duplicates due to repeated paths.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/checks/templates.py</file>
<original>for module_name, module_path in get_template_tag_modules():
    libraries[module_name].append(module_path)

for library_name, items in libraries.items():
    if len(items) > 1:
        errors.append(
            Error(
                E003.msg.format(
                    repr(library_name),
                    ", ".join(repr(item) for item in items),
                ),
                id=E003.id,
            )
        )</original>
<patched>for module_name, module_path in get_template_tag_modules():
    # Only add the module path if it is not already in the list for this module name
    if module_path not already in libraries[module_name]:
        libraries[module_name].append(module_path)

# Before checking for duplicates, ensure that each list of paths is unique
for library_name, items in libraries.items():
    unique_items = list(set(items))  # Convert items to a set to remove duplicates, then back to list
    if len(unique_items) > 1:
        errors.append(
            Error(
                E003.msg.format(
                    repr(library_name),
                    ", ".join(repr(item) for item in unique_items),
                ),
                id=E003.id,
            )
        )</patched>
```

This modification ensures that:
- Each template tag library's module path is only added once to the `libraries` dictionary, preventing the same path from being counted multiple times for a single library.
- Before checking for duplicates, it converts the list of module paths for each library into a set and back into a list. This process removes any duplicate paths that might have been added, ensuring that the error is only raised if there are genuinely multiple different paths for the same library name.

This approach should address the issue without causing the tests to fail, as it more accurately targets the problem described in the issue.
