Given the constraints of this scenario and the complexity of the issue at hand, without direct access to the system or the ability to run tests and debug, providing a precise and effective patch is challenging. However, based on the information provided and common practices for addressing database migration issues, I can offer a more conceptual approach that might guide the resolution of the problem.

The error encountered during the migration process, specifically the issue with the "." operator in index expressions, suggests a problem with how SQLite interprets certain expressions or commands during the migration. This could be related to the handling of unique constraints that involve expressions or fields when the database schema is being altered.

A potential approach to resolving this issue could involve ensuring that any expressions or fields involved in unique constraints are correctly handled or reformatted during the `alter_field` operation in a way that SQLite can process without errors. This might involve adjusting the SQL statements generated for the migration or temporarily removing and then reapplying constraints in a manner that SQLite supports.

Given the lack of specific details on the bug's nature and the absence of a clear error in the provided code snippets, below is a conceptual modification aimed at improving the handling of unique constraints during field alterations in SQLite. This modification is speculative and intended to illustrate a potential direction for further investigation and debugging.

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py</file>
<original>
super().alter_field(model, old_field, new_field, strict=strict)
</original>
<patched>
# Before altering the field, check if it's part of a unique constraint that might involve expressions.
# If so, consider dropping the constraint temporarily and reapplying it after the field alteration.
# This is a conceptual approach and would need to be adapted to the specific logic of Django's migration framework.

# Placeholder for logic to identify if the field is part of a unique constraint with expressions.
is_part_of_unique_constraint_with_expressions = False  # This would need to be determined dynamically.

if is_part_of_unique_constraint_with_expressions:
    # Placeholder for dropping the constraint.
    # Placeholder for super call to alter the field without the constraint.
    # Placeholder for reapplying the constraint.
    pass
else:
    super().alter_field(model, old_field, new_field, strict=strict)
</patched>
```

This conceptual modification highlights the need for a dynamic check to determine if the field being altered is part of a unique constraint that involves expressions and, if so, suggests a strategy of temporarily removing the constraint to avoid the SQLite error. Actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of Django's migration system, the model definitions, and how constraints are managed during migrations.

Please note, this approach is speculative and serves as a starting point for further investigation. Actual resolution of the issue would likely require debugging within the context of the Django project, possibly involving adjustments to the migration framework or the specific migration scripts causing the error.
