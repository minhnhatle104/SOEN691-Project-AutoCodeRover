Given the context and the error message related to the "." operator in index expressions, it seems the issue might be related to how expressions within unique constraints are handled during the `alter_field` operation in SQLite. However, without a clear indication of a specific bug in the provided code snippets or a detailed understanding of the internal workings and recent changes in Django's handling of such cases, proposing an accurate patch is challenging.

A common issue with SQLite migrations involving unique constraints is the handling of renaming fields or altering fields that are part of a unique constraint. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with how expressions are used or interpreted in this context, possibly due to the way SQLite's schema editor constructs SQL statements for these operations.

Without specific details on the cause of the error and without being able to pinpoint a precise bug in the provided code snippets, I can only hypothesize a general approach that might be considered when addressing such issues:

1. **Enhancing Expression Handling in Unique Constraints**: Ensure that expressions used in unique constraints are correctly transformed into SQL statements compatible with SQLite's requirements, especially when involved in schema alterations.

2. **Improving `alter_field` Method for Expression Support**: Modify the `alter_field` method in the SQLite schema editor to better handle fields involved in unique constraints with expressions.

Since I cannot provide a specific patch without more detailed information or without identifying a clear bug in the provided snippets, below is a hypothetical approach to how one might begin to address issues related to expression handling in unique constraints within the SQLite schema editor. This is purely illustrative and not a direct solution to the reported issue.

# Hypothetical modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py</file>
<original>
cursor.execute('UPDATE sqlite_master SET sql = replace(sql, %s, %s)', (search, replacement))
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical fix: Ensure that expressions in unique constraints are correctly handled
# This might involve checking if the operation involves a unique constraint with expressions
# and then applying a different strategy for updating sqlite_master or handling the alteration.
# Since the exact nature of the bug is not clear, this is a placeholder for where such logic could be added.
if "some condition indicating this is a unique constraint with expressions":
    # Custom logic to handle expressions in unique constraints
    pass
else:
    cursor.execute('UPDATE sqlite_master SET sql = replace(sql, %s, %s)', (search, replacement))
</patched>
```

Please note, the actual implementation would require a deep understanding of the specific issue, how Django's migration framework interacts with SQLite, and how expressions within unique constraints should be handled during schema alterations. This hypothetical modification is intended to illustrate the kind of approach that might be taken, rather than to provide a direct fix.
