Given the context and the nature of the issue with handling Unicode property escapes in regular expressions within the Pylint configuration, a hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that the regular expression compilation supports Unicode properties correctly. Since the Python `re` module has limited support for Unicode property escapes and the issue is related to the use of `\p{Han}` in a `.pylintrc` configuration, one approach could be to switch to using the `regex` module for pattern compilation in contexts where Unicode property escapes are expected. This solution assumes that the primary issue lies within the handling of these specific types of regular expressions in the naming style checks.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on the analysis of the provided context. Actual implementation details may vary based on the full codebase and project requirements.

<patched>
# Assuming the test is designed to fail due to the unsupported regex pattern, 
# this modification is to reflect the change to using the `regex` module which supports the pattern.
# The test might need to be adjusted based on the new expected behavior.

    )
# Note: The actual test modification will depend on the intended behavior. 
# If the original test was expecting a failure due to the regex issue, 
# the test logic might need to be inverted or adjusted to reflect that the issue is resolved.

This patch assumes the project can incorporate the `regex` module as a dependency, which offers more comprehensive support for Unicode properties in regular expressions than the built-in `re` module. Adjustments to the test case in `test_config.py` are speculative and would depend on the specific intentions behind the original test.
