Given the context and the issue described, the primary focus for the patch would be on how the `DjangoHelpFormatter` handles and formats the help text, specifically preserving line breaks and other formatting within the `help` attribute of management commands. However, without direct access to the `DjangoHelpFormatter` implementation and based on the information provided, I will propose a hypothetical patch that could address the issue by ensuring that the `help` text formatting is preserved.

Since we don't have the actual implementation details of `DjangoHelpFormatter`, this patch will assume that extending or modifying this formatter to handle multi-line help text more gracefully could solve the issue. The goal is to make sure that when the help text is displayed, it respects the original formatting specified in the command's `help` attribute.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/management/base.py</file>
<original>formatter_class=DjangoHelpFormatter,</original>
<patched>formatter_class=PreservingHelpFormatter,</patched>
```

# modification 2
Assuming we need to define `PreservingHelpFormatter` to replace `DjangoHelpFormatter` for this specific use case. This new formatter class would be designed to preserve the original formatting of the help text. Below is a hypothetical implementation of such a class, which would need to be added to an appropriate location within the Django project, possibly in the same file for simplicity.

```python
<file>django/core/management/base.py</file>
<original># Assuming there's no original code snippet for PreservingHelpFormatter as it's a new addition.</original>
<patched>
import argparse
from django.core.management.base import DjangoHelpFormatter

class PreservingHelpFormatter(DjangoHelpFormatter):
    """Custom help formatter to preserve the original formatting of the help text."""
    
    def _split_lines(self, text, width):
        """Override the _split_lines method to split lines based on the original line breaks."""
        # Splitting on line breaks instead of word-wrapping to preserve original formatting.
        return text.splitlines()

# Note: This patched code assumes that DjangoHelpFormatter inherits from argparse.HelpFormatter
# or behaves similarly. Adjustments may be necessary based on the actual implementation.
</patched>
```

This patch introduces a new formatter class `PreservingHelpFormatter` that overrides the `_split_lines` method from `argparse.HelpFormatter` (or `DjangoHelpFormatter` if it's a custom class inheriting from `argparse.HelpFormatter`). The overridden method ensures that the text is split based on original line breaks, preserving the intended formatting.

Please note, the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific behaviors of `DjangoHelpFormatter` and how it integrates with Django's management command framework. This solution assumes that the primary issue is with how help text is formatted when displayed, and that providing a custom formatter that preserves line breaks and other formatting can address the issue.
