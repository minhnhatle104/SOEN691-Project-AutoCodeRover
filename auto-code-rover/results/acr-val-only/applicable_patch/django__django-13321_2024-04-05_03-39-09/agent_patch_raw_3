Given the constraints and the need to address the issue without causing additional test failures, it's crucial to approach the problem with minimal changes that directly target the issue's root cause while ensuring compatibility with the existing Django framework's behavior and error handling mechanisms. The primary goal is to handle invalid session data gracefully without altering the fundamental behavior of session handling and signature verification processes.

Considering the feedback and the need for a more precise solution, let's focus on enhancing the error handling around the decoding and unsigning processes without introducing broad exception catches that might obscure other errors or change the expected behavior of the system.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py</file>
<original>return self.decode(s.session_data) if s else {}</original>
<patched>try:
    return self.decode(s.session_data) if s else {}
except django.core.signing.BadSignature:
    # Log the bad signature exception and return an empty session
    logging.warning("Session data had a bad signature. Starting a new session.")
    return {}
except binascii.Error as e:
    # Specifically handle the incorrect padding error from base64 decoding
    if 'Incorrect padding' in str(e):
        logging.warning("Session data had incorrect padding. Starting a new session.")
        return {}
    else:
        raise
</patched>
```

This modification specifically targets the session data decoding process in `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`, introducing more granular exception handling to address the `BadSignature` and `Incorrect padding` issues identified in the traceback. By logging warnings and returning an empty session dictionary in these cases, the system can avoid crashes due to corrupted or tampered session data while maintaining transparency about the issue through logging. This approach ensures that only known, relevant exceptions related to the issue at hand are caught, minimizing the impact on the broader system behavior and avoiding the masking of other potential errors.

This patch aims to directly address the issue described, with a focus on maintaining the integrity and behavior of the Django session handling system. By carefully handling specific exceptions related to session data decoding and signature verification, the patch seeks to improve the system's robustness against invalid session data without introducing side effects or altering expected behaviors.
