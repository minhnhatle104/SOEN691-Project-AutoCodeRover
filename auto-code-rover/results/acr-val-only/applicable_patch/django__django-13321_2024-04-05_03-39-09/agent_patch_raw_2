To address the issue more effectively and ensure compatibility with the existing Django framework's error handling conventions, let's refine the approach. The goal remains to prevent crashes due to invalid session data while ensuring that any modifications do not interfere with the normal operation of the application or the framework's design principles. Given this, let's revise the patches with a focus on more specific exception handling and maintaining the integrity of the session data handling process.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py</file>
<original>    def load(self):
        s = self._get_session_from_db()
        return self.decode(s.session_data) if s else {}
</original>
<patched>    def load(self):
        s = self._get_session_from_db()
        try:
            return self.decode(s.session_data) if s else {}
        except (django.core.signing.BadSignature, binascii.Error):
            # Handle specific exceptions related to session data decoding
            logging.warning("Invalid session data encountered and will be ignored.")
            return {}
</patched>
```

This modification specifically catches `django.core.signing.BadSignature` and `binascii.Error` exceptions, which are directly related to the issues observed (bad signature and incorrect padding for base64 decoding). This approach ensures that only known, relevant exceptions are caught, reducing the risk of inadvertently masking other issues.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/core/signing.py</file>
<original>def loads(s, key=None, salt='django.core.signing', serializer=JSONSerializer, max_age=None):
    """
    Reverse of dumps(), raise BadSignature if signature fails.

    The serializer is expected to accept a bytestring.
    """
    base64d = TimestampSigner(key, salt=salt).unsign(s, max_age=max_age).encode()
    decompress = base64d[:1] == b'.'
    if decompress:
        # It's compressed; uncompress it first
        base64d = base64d[1:]
    data = b64_decode(base64d)
    if decompress:
        data = zlib.decompress(data)
    return serializer().loads(data)
</original>
<patched>def loads(s, key=None, salt='django.core.signing', serializer=JSONSerializer, max_age=None):
    """
    Reverse of dumps(), raise BadSignature if signature fails.

    The serializer is expected to accept a bytestring.
    """
    try:
        base64d = TimestampSigner(key, salt=salt).unsign(s, max_age=max_age).encode()
        decompress = base64d[:1] == b'.'
        if decompress:
            # It's compressed; uncompress it first
            base64d = base64d[1:]
        data = b64_decode(base64d)
        if decompress:
            data = zlib.decompress(data)
        return serializer().loads(data)
    except (django.core.signing.BadSignature, binascii.Error) as e:
        # Specifically catch exceptions related to signature and base64 decoding
        logging.warning("Failed to load signed data due to invalid signature or incorrect padding: %s", e)
        raise django.core.signing.BadSignature("Failed to load signed data: invalid signature or data.")
</patched>
```

In this modification, the handling of exceptions in the `loads` function is refined to specifically catch `BadSignature` and `binascii.Error`, logging a warning and then re-raising a `BadSignature` exception to maintain the expected flow of control. This ensures that the system can log and appropriately handle cases of corrupted or tampered session data without breaking the expected behavior of the `loads` function.

These modifications aim to improve the robustness of session data handling in Django by providing clearer logging and handling for cases of invalid session data, while respecting the framework's design and error handling conventions.
