Given the initial attempt did not resolve the issue and considering the limitations of the provided context, a more appropriate approach would be to ensure that the case-insensitivity is handled within the `_read_table_qdp` function itself or in the way commands are parsed, rather than altering the input lines directly. This approach would avoid potential side effects on data integrity and ensure that the handling of commands is consistent with QDP's case-insensitive nature.

Since the detailed implementation of `_read_table_qdp` and its subsequent command parsing logic is not provided, I'll suggest a conceptual patch that should be applied to the command parsing logic within the `_read_table_qdp` function or wherever the QDP commands are actually interpreted.

This conceptual patch assumes that there is a point in the code where the commands extracted from the QDP file are matched against known commands (e.g., "READ SERR", "READ TERR", etc.). The patch would ensure that this comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, which is a common approach for handling such scenarios in Python.

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py</file>
<original>if command == "READ SERR":
    # process command
</original>
<patched>if command.lower() == "read serr":
    # process command
</patched>
```

This modification should be applied to all instances where commands are being compared to a string literal representing the command. If the commands are stored in a list or dictionary for lookup, those structures might need to be initialized in a way that ensures case-insensitive matching. For dictionaries, this could involve using a custom case-insensitive dictionary or converting keys to a consistent case (lower or upper) upon initialization and then also converting any lookup keys to the same case.

If the command parsing involves more complex patterns or a more extensive set of commands, utilizing regular expressions with the `re.IGNORECASE` flag for matching commands might be a more scalable solution:

# Conceptual modification for regex approach
```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py</file>
<original>import re
if re.match("READ SERR", command):
    # process command
</original>
<patched>import re
if re.match("read serr", command, re.IGNORECASE):
    # process command
</patched>
```

This approach ensures that the command matching logic is explicitly case-insensitive, aligning with the expectations for QDP file processing. It's important to review all places where commands are parsed and apply a consistent case-insensitivity strategy to ensure the issue is comprehensively addressed.
