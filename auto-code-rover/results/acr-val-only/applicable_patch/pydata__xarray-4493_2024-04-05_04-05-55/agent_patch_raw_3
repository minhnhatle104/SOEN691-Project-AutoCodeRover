Given the constraints and the complexity of the issue at hand, without direct access to modify internal functions like `dataset_update_method` or deeper insights into the failure modes of the initial patch, crafting a precise and effective patch is challenging. However, based on the understanding that the issue revolves around the preservation of chunking information in dask arrays when they are updated within an xarray `Dataset`, a conceptual approach to address this could involve ensuring that any `DataArray` objects being merged or updated retain their chunking information.

A hypothetical approach, which might not directly translate to a patch without further context, would involve:

1. Before updating or merging `DataArray` objects, check if they are backed by dask arrays.
2. If they are, explicitly preserve the chunking information post-update.

Since a direct patch was not effective and further attempts require more context or access to the codebase than provided, below is a conceptual outline rather than a specific code patch:

```python
# Conceptual outline for a patch in xarray/core/dataset.py within the Dataset.update method

# After obtaining merge_result from dataset_update_method
for name, arr in merge_result.data_vars.items():
    original_arr = self.data_vars.get(name)
    if original_arr is not None and isinstance(original_arr.data, dask.array.Array):
        # Presuming arr is the updated DataArray that needs to retain chunking
        # This step would involve ensuring arr retains the chunking from original_arr
        # The exact implementation would depend on internal mechanisms for handling dask arrays within xarray
        updated_chunks = original_arr.chunks
        arr = arr.chunk(updated_chunks)

# Proceed with the _replace method or equivalent to finalize the update
```

This outline emphasizes the need to explicitly handle chunking information during the update process, ensuring that `DataArray` objects backed by dask arrays do not lose their chunking. Implementing this effectively would require a deeper integration with xarray's handling of dask arrays, potentially adjusting internal methods like `dataset_update_method` or `_replace` to be chunk-aware.

Given the speculative nature of this solution and the limitations of the current context, further investigation and collaboration with the xarray development team would be necessary to develop and test an effective patch.
