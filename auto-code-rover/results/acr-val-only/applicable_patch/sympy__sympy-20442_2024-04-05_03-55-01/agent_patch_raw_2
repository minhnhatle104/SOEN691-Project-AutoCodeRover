Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, a more nuanced approach is required. The core issue seems to stem from how the conversion process handles expressions involving units that do not directly convert into the target units, leading to unexpected results. A more robust solution would involve ensuring that the conversion process accurately respects the mathematical relationships between units, especially in cases where units are combined in non-linear ways (e.g., through exponentiation).

Let's attempt a different approach by refining the conversion logic to better handle complex unit expressions, focusing on ensuring that units are only combined or simplified in ways that are mathematically valid and physically meaningful.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/physics/units/util.py</file>
<original>expr_scale_factor = get_total_scale_factor(expr)
return expr_scale_factor * Mul.fromiter((1/get_total_scale_factor(u) * u) ** p for u, p in zip(target_units, depmat))</original>
<patched># Adjust the approach to handle complex unit expressions more accurately
# This involves refining how scale factors are applied and ensuring that unit conversion is mathematically valid

# First, ensure that the expression is fully expanded to simplify handling of complex unit combinations
expr = expr.expand()

# Calculate the scale factor for the entire expression
expr_scale_factor = get_total_scale_factor(expr)

# Instead of directly applying the scale factor, decompose the expression and apply conversion where applicable
def apply_conversion(expr, target_units):
    if isinstance(expr, Mul):
        # For multiplication, apply conversion to each factor separately
        return Mul(*(apply_conversion(arg, target_units) for arg in expr.args))
    elif isinstance(expr, Pow):
        # For exponentiation, apply conversion to the base and adjust the exponent accordingly
        base_converted = apply_conversion(expr.base, target_units)
        return Pow(base_converted, expr.exp)
    elif isinstance(expr, Quantity):
        # Directly convert quantities using the existing scale factor logic
        return expr_scale_factor * (1/get_total_scale_factor(expr) * expr).simplify()
    else:
        # For any other type of expression, return it unmodified
        return expr

# Apply the refined conversion logic to the original expression
converted_expr = apply_conversion(expr, target_units)

# Return the converted expression, ensuring it is simplified for readability
return converted_expr.simplify()</patched>
```

This modification takes a different approach by first expanding the original expression to simplify the handling of complex unit combinations. It then applies the conversion process more granularly, treating multiplication and exponentiation separately to ensure that units are converted in a way that respects their mathematical relationships. This should help address the issue where units are combined inappropriately, leading to unexpected results like `joule**(7/9)`.

By refining the conversion logic in this manner, the patch aims to provide a more robust and accurate unit conversion process that can handle a wider range of unit expressions, including those involving complex combinations of units.
