            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the `convert_to` function and how units like `joule`, `second`, `kg`, `m`, and `s` are defined and used within the codebase. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that `convert_to` is a method within a class related to unit conversion, possibly within a physics or units module. The units mentioned (`joule`, `second`, `kg`, `m`, `s`) might be instances or definitions within a similar context.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method(\"convert_to\")`: This will help us find where the `convert_to` method is defined and potentially give us insight into which class or module it belongs to.\n\n2. `search_code(\"joule\")`: Since `joule` is directly involved in the issue, finding where and how it is defined or instantiated will be crucial for understanding the problem.\n\n3. `search_code(\"second\")`: Similarly, understanding how `second` is defined or used will help us grasp the unit conversion logic that might be affecting the `convert_to` method's behavior.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."
