Given the constraints and the feedback, it seems my initial approach to directly modify the exception handling in the `_config_initialization` method might not align perfectly with the existing code structure or expected behavior. A more nuanced approach, possibly involving better integration with the existing error handling and messaging system, might be required. However, without the ability to run tests or get specific feedback on what part of the patch caused the test failures, I'll propose an alternative approach based on the provided information and standard practices for handling such errors in command-line applications.

# modification 1
```python
<file>pylint/config/config_initialization.py</file>
<original>if unrecognized_options:
    msg = ", ".join(unrecognized_options)
    linter.add_message("unrecognized-option", line=0, args=msg)
    raise _UnrecognizedOptionError(options=unrecognized_options)</original>
<patched># Change the approach to handle unrecognized options without raising an exception.
# This involves logging the error and then directly printing a help message before exiting.
if unrecognized_options:
    msg = ", ".join(unrecognized_options)
    # Log the error message about unrecognized options.
    linter.add_message("unrecognized-option", line=0, args=msg)
    # Directly print a help message to guide the user, instead of raising an exception.
    print("Error: Unrecognized option(s) provided.")
    print("For a list of available options, use: pylint --help")
    sys.exit(1)</patched>
```

This modification aims to address the issue by avoiding the unhandled exception and instead providing immediate, clear feedback to the user when unrecognized options are encountered. By logging the error and then printing guidance on how to access help information, we maintain user-friendly behavior consistent with command-line tool conventions. This approach also ensures that the application exits gracefully with a non-zero status code, indicating an error condition as per Unix convention.
