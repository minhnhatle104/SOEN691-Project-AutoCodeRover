Specifically, we should look into the implementation of the error handling that leads to the traceback and how the command-line arguments are parsed and validated. Given the information from the issue, the following API calls would be relevant:\n\n1. Search for the class where the exception `_UnrecognizedOptionError` is defined to understand its structure and usage:\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"_UnrecognizedOptionError\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the traceback points to the `config_initialization.py` file and the `_config_initialization` method, it would be useful to examine this method to understand how unrecognized options are handled:\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"_config_initialization\", \"pylint/config/config_initialization.py\")\n   ```\n\n3. The `PylintRun` class is involved in the initialization process, as indicated by the traceback. Understanding its constructor could provide insights into how command-line arguments are processed:\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"PylintRun\")\n   ```\n\n4. Given that the expected behavior is to provide a user-friendly message without a traceback, it would be helpful to see if there's an existing method for printing usage or error messages related to command-line arguments:\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"print_usage\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the current handling of unrecognized options and how to improve it to match the expected behavior."

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, we can analyze the issue and the relevant parts of the codebase to formulate a plan for addressing the bug described in the issue. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n1. **_UnrecognizedOptionError Class**: This exception class is defined in `pylint/config/exceptions.py` and is designed to handle unrecognized options. It takes a list of unrecognized options as an argument. This indicates that the mechanism for detecting unrecognized options is already in place, and this exception is used to signal such a situation.\n\n2. **_config_initialization Method**: Located in `pylint/config/config_initialization.py`, this method is responsible for parsing all available options, reading configuration files and command-line arguments, and setting options accordingly. It's a critical part of the initialization process where unrecognized options are detected and handled. The method attempts to parse configuration from both the configuration file and the command line. If unrecognized options are found during command-line parsing, it collects them into a list, logs a message using `linter.add_message(\"unrecognized-option\", line=0, args=msg)`, and then raises an `_UnrecognizedOptionError` with the list of unrecognized options.\n\n3. **PylintRun Class and print_usage Method**: The search did not find the `PylintRun` class or a `print_usage` method in the codebase. This suggests that either the class or method names might have been incorrect, or they are not directly involved in the handling of unrecognized options or printing usage information.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from the handling of unrecognized options in the `_config_initialization` method. While the method correctly identifies and logs unrecognized options, it raises an exception that leads to an unhandled traceback being printed to the user. This behavior is not user-friendly and deviates from the expected behavior, which is to provide a clear, concise error message without a traceback and possibly print a usage message.\n\nTo address the issue, we should modify the handling of unrecognized options to prevent the traceback from being printed and instead display a helpful error message along with usage information (if possible). Since we didn't find a direct way to print usage information through a `print_usage` method, we may need to look into how help messages are generated and displayed in other parts of the application or consider implementing a new method for this purpose if necessary.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the error handling for unrecognized options in the `_config_initialization` method, ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue."
