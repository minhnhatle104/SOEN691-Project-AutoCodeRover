Given the feedback and the need to ensure that annotated-only members in superclasses are correctly recognized as documented, a more refined approach is needed. The initial attempt aimed to adjust the handling within the `filter_members` method, but it seems that the solution requires a more nuanced adjustment, particularly in how documentation checks are performed for inherited members.

Considering the complexity of the issue and the need to accurately identify members that are annotated in superclasses as documented, a revised patch should focus on enhancing the logic that determines whether a member is documented. This involves not just checking for the presence of annotations but also ensuring that these annotations are effectively considered part of the member's documentation.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>elif name in self.get_attr(cls, '__annotations__', {}):
                        return False</original>
<patched># If a member has annotations, consider it documented unless explicitly marked as undocumented
if name in self.get_attr(cls, '__annotations__', {}):
    if not self.options.undoc_members:
        # Check if there's explicit documentation available in the annotations
        annotation_doc = self.get_attr(cls, '__annotations__', {}).get(name, None)
        if annotation_doc:
            has_doc = True
    return False</patched>
```

This revised patch aims to explicitly check for documentation within the annotations of a member. If the `:undoc-members:` option is not set, it assumes that the presence of an annotation can imply documentation. However, it also tries to check if there's explicit documentation available within the annotation itself, which might require additional logic to parse or interpret annotation content meaningfully.

# Additional Consideration
It's important to note that this patch assumes that annotations can contain or imply documentation, which might not always hold true depending on how annotations are used within a project. Therefore, further refinement might be necessary to distinguish between different types of annotations and how they should be treated in terms of documentation.

Furthermore, this patch is conceptual and aims to address the issue based on the provided context. Additional testing and validation are crucial to ensure that the patch resolves the issue without introducing new problems, especially in edge cases or with complex inheritance structures.
