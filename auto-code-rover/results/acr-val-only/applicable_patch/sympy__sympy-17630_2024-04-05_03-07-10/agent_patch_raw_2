Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to directly address the issue with handling `Zero` objects in the `colblocksizes` method. The initial attempt to modify both `colblocksizes` and `_blockmul` might have been overly complex or incorrect in handling the specifics of `ZeroMatrix` and `Zero` objects. A more focused and accurate fix is needed, particularly one that ensures compatibility with all parts of the codebase and does not introduce new issues.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py</file>
<original>    def colblocksizes(self):
        return [self.blocks[0, i].cols for i in range(self.blockshape[1])]
</original>
<patched>    def colblocksizes(self):
        from sympy.core.numbers import Zero
        return [self.blocks[0, i].cols if not isinstance(self.blocks[0, i], Zero) else 0 for i in range(self.blockshape[1])]
</patched>
```

This modification directly addresses the issue where a `Zero` object does not have a `cols` attribute, which was causing the `AttributeError`. By checking if a block is an instance of `Zero` and handling it appropriately (by treating it as having 0 columns), we can avoid the error and ensure that the `colblocksizes` method works correctly even when `Zero` objects are present in the block matrix. This approach is more targeted and should not interfere with other parts of the codebase or the intended simplifications that lead to `ZeroMatrix` instances being replaced with `Zero` objects.
