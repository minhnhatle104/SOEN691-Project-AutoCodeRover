These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that operations involving `ZeroMatrix` and `Zero` objects are handled correctly in the context of block matrix multiplication. The first modification ensures that the `colblocksizes` method can handle `ZeroMatrix` objects by explicitly checking for them and returning 0 for their column sizes. The second modification updates the `_blockmul` method to correctly handle multiplication involving `ZeroMatrix` objects, ensuring that the result of multiplying a `ZeroMatrix` with any matrix is a `ZeroMatrix` of appropriate dimensions, thus preventing the simplification to `Zero` objects that lack the necessary attributes for subsequent operations.
