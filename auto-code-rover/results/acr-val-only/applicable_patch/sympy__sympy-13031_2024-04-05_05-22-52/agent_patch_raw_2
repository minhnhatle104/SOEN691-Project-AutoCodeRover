Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more accurately, let's revise the approach. The original issue is related to the behavior change in handling matrices with zero rows when using `hstack`. The initial patch attempted to adjust the behavior of `row_join` to accommodate matrices with zero rows more effectively, but it seems that was not the correct approach or it introduced other issues. Let's consider a different approach that directly addresses the concatenation behavior without introducing unintended side effects.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/common.py</file>
<original>if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
    return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)</original>
<patched># Adjusted the condition to better handle cases where matrices with zero rows are involved.
# The original issue was related to the unexpected behavior change in sympy 1.1 regarding hstack with zero-row matrices.
# This patch aims to ensure that matrices with zero rows are handled consistently, preserving the dimensions correctly.
if self.cols == 0:
    # If `self` is a matrix with zero columns (and potentially zero rows), create a new matrix that matches the dimensions of `other` in terms of columns but keeps the row count of `self`.
    # This ensures that the horizontal stacking (hstack) behaves as expected, even when dealing with matrices that have zero rows.
    return self._new(self.rows, other.cols, []).row_join(other)
else if self.rows == 0 and other.rows == 0:
    # When both matrices have zero rows, ensure the resulting matrix also has zero rows but combines the column counts.
    # This case specifically addresses the issue reported with hstack behavior in sympy 1.1.
    return self._new(0, self.cols + other.cols, [])</patched>
```

This revised patch aims to directly address the issue with `hstack` when dealing with matrices that have zero rows. By adjusting the handling within `row_join`, the goal is to ensure that the dimensions of the resulting matrix are consistent with the expectations and the behavior observed in sympy 1.0, thus resolving the reported issue.
