<original>if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
    return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)</original>
<patched># The condition below has been updated to ensure that when self has zero columns,
# it can be joined with another matrix regardless of the other's dimensions, 
# addressing the issue where hstack behavior changed unexpectedly.
# This change aims to restore the behavior observed in sympy 1.0 for matrices with zero rows.
if self.cols == 0:
    # Create a new matrix with dimensions that match the total columns of `other` 
    # while maintaining zero rows, then proceed with row_join.
    return self._new(0, other.cols, []).row_join(other)</patched>
