        "content": "Based on the information collected from the search results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. **Matrix Class**: The initial search for a `Matrix` class did not yield any results, which suggests that the `Matrix` functionalities, including `hstack` and `vstack`, are likely implemented within a module or a different class structure than a direct `Matrix` class.\n\n2. **hstack Method**: The `hstack` method is found within the `MatrixShaping` class in the file `sympy/matrices/common.py`. This method is designed to horizontally join matrices (side by side) using the `row_join` method. The method's documentation and example suggest that it takes multiple matrix arguments and joins them horizontally. The implementation uses the `reduce` function along with `kls.row_join`, indicating that it iteratively applies `row_join` to the matrices provided as arguments.\n\n3. **vstack Method**: Similarly, the `vstack` method is also located within the `MatrixShaping` class in the same file as `hstack`. This method vertically joins matrices (one on top of the other) using the `col_join` method. Like `hstack`, `vstack` also uses the `reduce` function but with `kls.col_join` for vertical joining of matrices.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem seems to revolve around the behavior change of `hstack` between sympy versions 1.0 and 1.1, particularly when dealing with matrices of zero rows. In sympy 1.0, horizontally stacking matrices with zero rows would result in a matrix whose column count is the sum of the columns of the matrices being stacked. However, in sympy 1.1, the behavior seems to have changed, leading to inconsistent results when matrices with zero rows are involved.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to further analyze the implementation of `hstack` (and possibly `vstack` for completeness) to understand how matrices with zero rows are handled and identify any changes or bugs introduced in sympy 1.1 that could have altered the expected behavior. This might involve looking into the `row_join` method referenced in the `hstack` implementation and understanding how it deals with matrices of different dimensions, especially those with zero rows or columns."
