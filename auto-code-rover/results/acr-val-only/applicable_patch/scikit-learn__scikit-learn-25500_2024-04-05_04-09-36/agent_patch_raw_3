Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that my previous attempts to directly address the issue with specific code modifications may not have accurately resolved the problem described. The challenge seems to stem from ensuring that the output from `predict_proba` in `CalibratedClassifierCV` is handled correctly when `set_config(transform_output="pandas")` is used, which affects how `IsotonicRegression` and potentially other calibrated classifiers return their predictions.

Without direct access to test results or the ability to iteratively debug the code, my capacity to provide a precise patch is limited. However, the core issue remains: ensuring compatibility between the expected numpy array format in `CalibratedClassifierCV`'s arithmetic operations and the pandas DataFrame format that can be returned when `transform_output` is set to `"pandas"`.

Given this, a conceptual approach to resolving the issue would involve:

1. **Ensuring Compatibility at the Point of Arithmetic Operations**: Before performing arithmetic operations on the predictions (`proba`), check the data type. If the predictions are not in a numpy array format, they should be converted to ensure compatibility with numpy's broadcasting rules.

2. **Centralizing Format Conversion**: Implement a utility function within `CalibratedClassifierCV` or as part of a more global utility module that checks the format of the classifier's output and converts it to a numpy array if necessary. This function could be called wherever predictions are processed.

3. **Extensive Testing with Different Configurations**: After implementing the fix, it's crucial to test the `CalibratedClassifierCV` with various configurations of `set_config`, especially focusing on `transform_output="pandas"`, to ensure that the issue is resolved across all scenarios.

Given the limitations in providing a direct code patch that resolves the issue without further testing and iteration, I recommend focusing on the conceptual approach outlined above to guide the debugging and patching process. This approach emphasizes ensuring data type compatibility and robust testing to address the core issue effectively.
