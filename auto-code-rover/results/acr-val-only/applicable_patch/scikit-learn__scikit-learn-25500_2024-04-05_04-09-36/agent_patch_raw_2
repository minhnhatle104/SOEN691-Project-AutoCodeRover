Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to ensure compatibility across different output types while maintaining the expected behavior of the `predict_proba` method in `CalibratedClassifierCV`. The issue seems to stem from the arithmetic operations performed on the output of `predict_proba` from the calibrated classifiers, which may not be directly compatible with numpy's broadcasting rules when the output is a pandas DataFrame. A more robust solution would involve explicitly checking the output type and ensuring it is converted to a numpy array before performing arithmetic operations.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/calibration.py</file>
<original>            mean_proba += proba</original>
<patched>            # Convert proba to numpy array if it's a pandas DataFrame
            if isinstance(proba, pd.DataFrame):
                proba = proba.values
            mean_proba += proba</patched>
```

This modification explicitly checks if `proba` is a pandas DataFrame by using `isinstance(proba, pd.DataFrame)`. If true, it converts `proba` to a numpy array using `.values`. This ensures that the subsequent operation `mean_proba += proba` is performed on numpy arrays, thus avoiding the broadcasting issue regardless of the configuration set by `set_config(transform_output="pandas")`.

This approach requires importing pandas at the top of the file:

# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/calibration.py</file>
<original>import numpy as np</original>
<patched>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd</patched>
```

These modifications together ensure that the `predict_proba` method in `CalibratedClassifierCV` can handle outputs from calibrated classifiers correctly, even when those outputs are pandas DataFrames, thus resolving the issue described.
