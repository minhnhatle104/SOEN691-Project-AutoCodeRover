Given the feedback and the need to revise the approach, it's clear that the direct modification to include the value in the error message through string formatting in the `raise ValidationError` line might not be correctly addressing the issue, or there could have been a misunderstanding in the implementation details. Since the direct interpolation approach has not resolved the issue, let's consider a more detailed and cautious approach to ensure compatibility and correctness.

Upon reevaluation, it seems there might have been a misinterpretation in how the error message is formatted and how parameters are passed to `ValidationError`. The correct approach should involve ensuring that the error message formatting mechanism is properly utilized, which typically involves passing parameters as part of the `params` argument to `ValidationError`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice')</original>
<patched>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice', params={'value': value})</patched>
```

This patch corrects the approach by passing the `value` as part of the `params` dictionary to the `ValidationError`. This method is consistent with Django's error handling mechanism, where `params` is used to populate placeholders in the error message template. This change ensures that the error message can dynamically include the invalid value by utilizing Django's built-in formatting capabilities in error messages, thus addressing the issue without assuming the error message directly supports `%` formatting or string interpolation at the point of the `raise` statement.
