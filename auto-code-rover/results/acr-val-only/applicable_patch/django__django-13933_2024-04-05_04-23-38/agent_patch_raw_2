Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach to directly interpolate the value into the error message might not work as expected due to the structure of the error messages or how the values are handled. Let's revise the approach to ensure compatibility with the existing error message framework in Django, which typically uses formatted strings.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice')</original>
<patched>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'] % {'value': str(value)}, code='invalid_choice')</patched>
```

In this revised patch, the key difference is ensuring that the `value` is explicitly converted to a string before being inserted into the error message. This change aims to prevent any type-related issues that might have caused the tests to fail previously. Additionally, it explicitly uses the `%` formatting operator to insert the `value` into the error message, assuming that the error message is designed to accept a `value` key for formatting purposes. This approach should be more robust and compatible with various types of values that could cause a validation error.
