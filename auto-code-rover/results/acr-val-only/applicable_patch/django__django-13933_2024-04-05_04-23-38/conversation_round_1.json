        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we have the following information:\n\n### ModelChoiceField\n- Located in `django/forms/models.py`.\n- Inherits from `ChoiceField`.\n- Contains a default error message for `invalid_choice` that does not include the invalid value.\n- Methods of interest include `__init__`, `to_python`, `validate`, among others. However, there's no direct mention of a method named `ValidationError`, which suggests that the validation error is raised elsewhere, possibly in one of the methods like `validate` or `to_python`.\n\n### ModelMultipleChoiceField\n- Also located in `django/forms/models.py`.\n- Inherits from `ModelChoiceField`, thus sharing some functionality but with additional handling for multiple choices.\n- Contains enhanced error messages for `invalid_choice` that include the invalid value using `%(value)s`.\n- Methods of interest include `__init__`, `to_python`, `clean`, `_check_values`, which could be involved in the validation and error handling process.\n\n### Analysis\nThe issue at hand is that `ModelChoiceField` does not include the value of the invalid choice in the error message when raising a `ValidationError`, unlike `ModelMultipleChoiceField` which does. The absence of a direct `ValidationError` method in `ModelChoiceField` suggests that the error is raised within another method, likely `validate` or `to_python`, where the validation logic is implemented.\n\nGiven that `ModelMultipleChoiceField` successfully includes the invalid value in its error message, the implementation in `ModelMultipleChoiceField` could serve as a reference for updating `ModelChoiceField`. Specifically, the way `ModelMultipleChoiceField` formats its `invalid_choice` error message with `%(value)s` is what needs to be replicated in `ModelChoiceField`.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Review `validate` and `to_python` methods in `ModelChoiceField`**: Since the `ValidationError` search did not yield direct results, these methods are the most likely places where the error is raised. Understanding how they currently handle validation and errors will be crucial.\n\n2. **Compare with `ModelMultipleChoiceField` implementation**: Specifically, how `ModelMultipleChoiceField` handles error messages in its `validate`, `to_python`, or other relevant methods. This comparison can reveal how to adjust `ModelChoiceField` to include the invalid value in the error message.\n\n3. **Patch Proposal**: Based on the analysis, propose changes to the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid choice value in the `invalid_choice` error message, similar to `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to review the `validate` and `to_python` methods of both fields to understand the current implementation and plan the necessary changes."
