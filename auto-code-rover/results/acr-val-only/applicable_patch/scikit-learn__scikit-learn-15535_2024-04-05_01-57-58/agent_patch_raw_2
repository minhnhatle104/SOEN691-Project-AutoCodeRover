Given the constraints and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, a more conservative approach is required. The initial attempt aimed to directly convert non-numeric labels to a numeric format within the `mutual_info_score` function. However, considering the feedback, it's important to ensure compatibility and avoid altering the behavior for existing users who rely on the current functionality.

A revised approach would involve adding a pre-validation step to handle non-numeric data more gracefully, ensuring that any modifications do not impact the existing functionality and pass all tests. This could involve a check to see if the data is already in a suitable numeric format and only applying transformations if necessary. Additionally, it's crucial to maintain the original behavior when numeric data is provided.

Given the limitations of the initial patch and the need to avoid test failures, here's a revised patch that focuses on ensuring compatibility and addressing the issue without altering the core functionality of the `mutual_info_score` method.

            labels_pred = np.array(labels_pred, dtype=np.float64)
        except ValueError:
            # Fallback for non-numeric labels: Encode labels as categories
            from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
            le = LabelEncoder()
            labels_true = le.fit_transform(labels_true)
            labels_pred = le.transform(labels_pred)
        labels_true, labels_pred = check_clusterings(labels_true, labels_pred)
        contingency = contingency_matrix(labels_true, labels_pred, sparse=True)
    else:
        contingency = check_array(contingency,
                                  accept_sparse=['csr', 'csc', 'coo'],
                                  dtype=[int, np.int32, np.int64])</patched>
```

This revised patch attempts to first convert the labels to a numeric format directly. If this conversion fails due to the presence of non-numeric data (e.g., strings), it falls back to using `LabelEncoder` to transform the labels into a numeric format. This approach aims to preserve the original behavior when possible, while providing a robust fallback for handling non-numeric labels. This should address the issue without introducing changes that could cause test failures, assuming the tests expect the function to handle numeric inputs directly.
