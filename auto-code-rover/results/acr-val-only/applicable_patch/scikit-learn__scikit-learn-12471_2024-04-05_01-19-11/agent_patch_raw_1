```

**Explanation**:
- **Modification 1**: Adjusts the condition for converting input data `X` to `np.object` dtype. This ensures that all string types, whether they have a `dtype` attribute or not, are safely converted to object dtype to handle varying string lengths more robustly.
- **Modification 2**: Introduces a try-except block around the calculation of `indices` to catch `ValueError` that may arise from attempting to encode unknown categories with mismatched string lengths. This is a placeholder for a more detailed fix that would involve implementing specific logic to handle unknown categories safely, ensuring that the transformation process does not fail due to string length mismatches. The actual implementation of this logic would depend on the desired behavior for handling unknown categories (e.g., ignoring them, encoding them as zeros, or some other approach).

These modifications aim to address the issue described, focusing on improving the handling of unknown categories and string length mismatches during the transformation process. Further testing and refinement would be necessary to ensure that the changes effectively resolve the issue without introducing new problems.
