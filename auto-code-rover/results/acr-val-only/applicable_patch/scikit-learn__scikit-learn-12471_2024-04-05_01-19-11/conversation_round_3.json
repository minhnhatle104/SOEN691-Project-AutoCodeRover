        "content": "<issue>OneHotEncoder ignore unknown error when categories are strings\n#### Description\nThis bug is very specific, but it happens when you set OneHotEncoder to ignore unknown entries.\nand your labels are strings. The memory of the arrays is not handled safely and it can lead to a ValueError\nBasically, when you call the transform method it will sets all the unknown strings on your array to OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] which is the first category alphabetically sorted given for fit\nIf this OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] is a long string, and the array that you want to transform has small strings, then it is impossible to fit the whole  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] into the entries of the array we want to transform. So  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0]  is truncated and this raise the ValueError.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n# It needs to be numpy arrays, the error does not appear\n# is you have lists of lists because it gets treated like an array of objects.\ntrain  = np.array([ '22','333','4444','11111111' ]).reshape((-1,1))\ntest   = np.array([ '55555',  '22' ]).reshape((-1,1))\nohe = OneHotEncoder(dtype=bool,handle_unknown='ignore')\nohe.fit( train )\nenc_test = ohe.transform( test )\n```\n#### Expected Results\nHere we should get an sparse matrix 2x4 false everywhere except at (1,1) the '22' that is known\n#### Actual Results\n> ValueError: y contains previously unseen labels: ['111111']\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18)  [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]\nmachine: Linux-4.4.0-138-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python\nBLAS:\nmacros: HAVE_CBLAS=None\ncblas_libs: openblas, openblas\nlib_dirs: /usr/lib\nPython deps:\nCython: 0.25.2\nscipy: 0.18.1\nsetuptools: 36.7.0\npip: 9.0.1\nnumpy: 1.15.2\npandas: 0.19.1\nsklearn: 0.21.dev0\n#### Comments\nI already implemented a fix for this issue, where I check the size of the elements in the array before, and I cast them into objects if necessary.\n</issue>"

This class is responsible for converting categorical variable(s) into a form that could be provided to ML algorithms to do a better job in prediction. The `OneHotEncoder` class has several methods, but the issue specifically mentions problems with handling unknown entries when the labels are strings, leading to a `ValueError` during the transformation process.\n\nThe issue description points out a problem in the `transform` method when the `handle_unknown='ignore'` parameter is set, and the input array contains strings of varying lengths. The error occurs because the method attempts to replace unknown strings with the first category (alphabetically sorted) from `OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0]`, which can lead to truncation and a subsequent `ValueError` if the first category's string length is longer than the strings in the array being transformed.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n1. Reviewing the implementation of the `transform` method to understand how it handles unknown categories and why it leads to a `ValueError` under the described conditions.\n2. Investigating how the categories are stored and accessed within the `OneHotEncoder` class, specifically looking at `OneHotEncoder.categories_`.\n3. Considering the proposed fix mentioned in the issue, which involves checking the size of the elements in the array before transformation and casting them into objects if necessary. This suggests a need to modify the `transform` method to safely handle arrays with strings of varying lengths.\n\nTo proceed with these steps, we would need to examine the implementation details of the `transform` method within the `OneHotEncoder` class.

The method checks if the encoder is fitted by verifying the existence of `categories_`, which is crucial for the transformation process.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet, we can see that the `transform` method delegates the actual transformation work to either `_legacy_transform` or `_transform_new`, depending on whether the encoder is in legacy mode (`self._legacy_mode`).

This method is crucial for understanding how the `OneHotEncoder` handles the transformation of input data, especially in the context of the reported issue regarding the handling of unknown categories when the labels are strings.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet, we can observe several key steps in the transformation process:\n\n1. **Input Checking and Conversion**: The method starts by checking the input array `X` and determining its data type. If `X` does not have a `dtype` attribute and its temporary dtype is a subtype of string (`np.str_`), it converts `X` to have a dtype of `np.object`. This step ensures that string data is correctly handled as object data, which is crucial for dealing with varying string lengths.\n\n2. **Transformation to Integer and Mask Creation**: The method then transforms the input data `X` into integer-encoded form (`X_int`) and creates a mask (`X_mask`) to identify known and unknown categories, based on the `handle_unknown` parameter.\n\n3. **Sparse Matrix Construction**: Finally, it constructs a sparse matrix (`out`) representing the one-hot encoded form of the input data. This matrix is then returned either as a sparse matrix or converted to an array, depending on the `sparse` attribute of the `OneHotEncoder`.\n\nThe issue described in the bug report involves a `ValueError` that occurs when unknown string categories are encountered, and the encoder is set to ignore these unknown categories. The error is triggered when attempting to replace unknown strings with the first known category, which can lead to truncation issues if there is a mismatch in string lengths.\n\nGiven the details of the `_transform_new` method, the bug likely resides in how unknown categories are handled and how the transformation process deals with string lengths. The method does take steps to handle string data by converting it to `np.object`, but the issue may lie in subsequent steps where the actual encoding and handling of unknown categories occur.\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to:\n- Ensure that the handling of unknown categories does not lead to truncation or other errors when the input data contains strings of varying lengths.\n- Possibly modify the way unknown categories are encoded or ignored, ensuring that the process is safe and does not assume that string lengths are uniform.\n\nBased on this analysis, the bug location is confirmed to be within the `_transform_new` method of the `OneHotEncoder` class in `sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py`. The next step would involve crafting a patch that addresses the specific handling of unknown string categories in a way that prevents the `ValueError` from occurring."
