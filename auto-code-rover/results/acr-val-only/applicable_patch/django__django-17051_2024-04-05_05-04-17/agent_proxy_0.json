            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation of `bulk_create` and how it handles `update_conflicts`. Specifically, we should look into where `returning_fields` gets removed when `update_conflicts` is true, as mentioned in the issue description. This will help us understand the current behavior and how it can be modified to include returning IDs when `update_conflicts` is true.\n\nGiven this, I will use the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method(\"bulk_create\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the `bulk_create` method across the codebase, which is crucial for understanding how it currently handles conflicts and why it might not be returning IDs.\n\n2. `search_code(\"returning_fields\")`: Since the issue description mentions that `returning_fields` gets removed in the case of `update_conflicts`, searching for this code snippet will help us locate the exact part of the code where this behavior is defined. This is essential for understanding the logic behind the removal and how it can be adjusted."
