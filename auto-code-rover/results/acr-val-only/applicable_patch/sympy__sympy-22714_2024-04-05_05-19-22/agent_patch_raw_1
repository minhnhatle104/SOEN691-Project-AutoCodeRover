Explanation:
The patch suggests modifying the `__new__` method in the `Point2D` class to ensure that the arguments (`args`) are explicitly simplified before creating a `Point` object. This change aims to address the issue where creating a `Point2D` object within the `with sp.evaluate(False):` context leads to unexpected behavior due to the arguments not being evaluated as expected. By simplifying the arguments, we ensure that they are in a form that the `Point` constructor can handle correctly, even when global evaluation is disabled. This approach maintains the intended functionality of the `evaluate` context (to control evaluation) while ensuring that `Point2D` objects are created correctly.
