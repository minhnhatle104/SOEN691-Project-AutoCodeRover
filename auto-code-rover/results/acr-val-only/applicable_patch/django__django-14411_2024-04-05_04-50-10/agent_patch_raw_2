Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and considering the nature of the problem, it seems we need a different approach. Since the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` does not inherently support a 'for' attribute due to its read-only nature and the fact that it does not render an input element, the solution should ensure that any label associated with this widget does not attempt to use a 'for' attribute inappropriately.

Given the limitations in directly modifying the template content and the lack of specific details about how the label is rendered in relation to the widget, a more appropriate patch might involve adjusting how the widget is rendered in the admin interface to ensure it is not associated with a label in a way that requires a 'for' attribute. This could involve modifying the admin rendering logic to treat this widget differently when generating labels.

However, without direct access to modify the template or more detailed insight into the admin rendering process that associates labels with widgets, creating a precise patch is challenging. A hypothetical approach would involve ensuring that when the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is rendered, it either does not get associated with a label at all or the association does not rely on a 'for' attribute.

Since the provided context and capabilities do not allow for creating a more accurate patch based on the actual template content or detailed admin rendering logic, and the initial attempt to remove the 'for' attribute from the widget's attributes did not resolve the issue, it's clear that the solution requires a more in-depth modification either to the Django admin's handling of read-only fields or to the template logic itself.

In a real-world scenario, resolving this issue would likely involve:
- Directly modifying the `auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html` template to ensure it does not generate a 'for' attribute for labels when rendering the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`.
- Adjusting the admin form rendering logic in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` or related admin form rendering utilities to special-case the handling of read-only widgets like `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` to prevent inappropriate label association.

Without the ability to directly access and modify template files or a more detailed understanding of the admin form rendering process, providing a specific code patch to resolve the issue is not feasible under the current constraints.
