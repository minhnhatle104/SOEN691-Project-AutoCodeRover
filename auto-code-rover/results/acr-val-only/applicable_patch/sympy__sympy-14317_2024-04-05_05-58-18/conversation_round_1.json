        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, it appears that the `Poly` class, located in `sympy/polys/polytools.py`, does not directly implement the `latex`, `__str__`, or `pretty` methods. This suggests that the printing functionality for the `Poly` class might be handled elsewhere, possibly by a more generic printing system or by specific printer classes/methods that are designed to handle various types of SymPy objects.\n\nGiven that direct method searches for `latex`, `__str__`, and `pretty` within the `Poly` class yielded no results, we should consider the following possibilities for further investigation:\n\n1. **Generic Printing System**: SymPy often uses a generic system for handling the string representations of objects, which could involve visitor patterns or a registry of printer functions/classes. This system might be responsible for determining how objects like `Poly` are converted to strings, pretty-printed, or converted to LaTeX.\n\n2. **Dedicated Printer Classes/Functions**: There might be dedicated classes or functions responsible for printing, which are not part of the `Poly` class itself. These could be located in a separate module or file dedicated to printing functionality.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the next steps for investigation should involve looking for the parts of the SymPy codebase responsible for printing. Specifically, we should search for:\n- The generic printing system or registry if SymPy uses one.\n- Any dedicated printer classes or functions for LaTeX, pretty, and string representations.\n\nHowever, without the ability to directly invoke more search API calls at this moment, we can hypothesize that the issue might be due to the way the LaTeX printer function or class is ordering the terms of the polynomial. It might not be considering the degrees of the monomials in the same way as the `__str__` and `pretty` printers, possibly due to a missing or incorrectly implemented sorting mechanism for the terms before generating the LaTeX code.\n\nTo address the issue, one would likely need to:\n- Identify and review the implementation of the LaTeX printer for polynomials.\n- Compare its term ordering logic with that used by the `__str__` and `pretty` printers.\n- Modify the LaTeX printer implementation to ensure it orders the terms from highest to lowest degrees, consistent with the other printers.\n\nThis approach would ensure consistency across different representations of the `Poly` class, improving the usability and predictability of the SymPy library for its users."
