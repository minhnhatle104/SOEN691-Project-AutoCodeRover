Given the initial attempt did not resolve the issue and considering the structure of the `_print_Poly` method as provided, it seems the approach to directly influence the order through the `self._print(poly.as_expr(), order='lex')` call was incorrect, primarily because the `order` parameter might not be applicable in this context or was not correctly applied to influence the polynomial term ordering in the LaTeX output.

A more accurate approach would involve ensuring that the polynomial's terms are explicitly sorted in the desired order before generating the LaTeX string. However, the provided `_print_Poly` method does not directly manipulate the terms of the polynomial; it prints the polynomial expression as a whole. The sorting of terms needs to be handled at a level where the individual terms of the polynomial are accessible and can be ordered as required.

Given the constraints and the information available, a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without a deeper understanding of how `poly.as_expr()` constructs the expression and whether it supports ordering options that influence the output directly. In typical scenarios, ensuring consistent term ordering might involve manipulating the polynomial's terms directly or utilizing a function or method that supports ordering parameters effectively.

Since the direct approach to modify term ordering within the `_print_Poly` method seems infeasible without further context or access to additional methods that handle term ordering, an alternative patch cannot be accurately proposed at this moment. The resolution would likely involve a deeper dive into the `Poly` class's methods, specifically those that convert a polynomial to an expression or string, to identify where the term ordering can be influenced or corrected for LaTeX output specifically.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the documentation or source code of `poly.as_expr()` or similar methods to understand how they handle term ordering.
- Identifying if there's a way to enforce a specific term order (e.g., descending by degree) when converting a `Poly` object into an expression for LaTeX printing.
- If the current system does not support the necessary ordering, considering the implementation of such functionality while ensuring it does not adversely affect other parts of the system.

This situation underscores the complexity of working with symbolic mathematics libraries and the importance of a thorough understanding of the underlying data structures and methods for manipulating and representing mathematical expressions.
