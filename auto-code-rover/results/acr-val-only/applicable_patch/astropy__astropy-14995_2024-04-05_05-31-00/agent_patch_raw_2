Given the feedback and the need to revise the approach, it's clear that the initial patch might not have addressed the core issue correctly or introduced unintended side effects. The primary goal is to ensure that when one of the operands does not have a mask, the operation still proceeds without errors, particularly when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. Let's refine the approach by focusing on how the mask is handled during the arithmetic operation, especially when one operand's mask is `None`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py</file>
<original># Now call the _arithmetics method to do the arithmetic.
result, init_kwds = operand._arithmetic(operation, operand2, **kwargs)</original>
<patched># Adjust handling for when one operand does not have a mask.
# This involves checking if either operand's mask is None and handling it appropriately.
if 'handle_mask' in kwargs and kwargs['handle_mask'] == np.bitwise_or:
    if hasattr(operand, 'mask') and operand.mask is None:
        operand.mask = np.zeros(operand.data.shape, dtype=bool)
    if hasattr(operand2, 'mask') and operand2.mask is None:
        operand2.mask = np.zeros(operand2.data.shape, dtype=bool)

# Now call the _arithmetic method to do the arithmetic.
result, init_kwds = operand._arithmetic(operation, operand2, **kwargs)</patched>
```

This revised patch specifically targets the scenario where the `handle_mask` operation is set to `np.bitwise_or`, and one of the operands does not have a mask. It ensures that before proceeding with the arithmetic operation, if either operand's mask is `None`, a default mask of zeros (of the same shape as the operand's data and of boolean type) is created and assigned. This approach directly addresses the issue of attempting to perform a bitwise operation on an integer and `NoneType`, which was the cause of the `TypeError`. By ensuring both operands have a valid mask (even if it's a default "no-mask" represented by an array of zeros), the `np.bitwise_or` operation can proceed without errors.
