This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that when `operand2` is `None` (indicating the absence of a mask in one of the operands), it is replaced with a default mask of zeros (of the same shape as the operand's data and of boolean type) before proceeding with the arithmetic operation. This approach ensures that the `np.bitwise_or` operation (or any other mask handling operation specified) can be performed without encountering a `TypeError` due to one of the operands being `None`. This solution maintains the expected behavior of mask propagation and handling within arithmetic operations.
