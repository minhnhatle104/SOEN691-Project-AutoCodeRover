        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, let's analyze the relevant parts of the codebase to address the issue described in the initial problem statement.\n\n### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\nLocated in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n\n### AbstractBaseUser Class\nLocated in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like `password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method `get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the password reset token issue.\n\n### Issue Analysis\nThe issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email address in the meantime.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nTo resolve this issue, the user's email address should be included in the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value` in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued password reset tokens, as the hash value will no longer match when the token is used.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all user models are guaranteed to have an email field, as mentioned in the issue description. The solution will need to account for this variability, possibly by checking if the user model has an email field and including it in the hash value only if it exists.\n\nIn the next steps, we would draft the code changes required to implement this solution, taking into account the structure and practices observed in the Django codebase."

It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model implementations while providing a standard way to reference the user's email field.\n\n### Implications for the Solution\nThe presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the email field across different user model implementations. This insight is directly relevant to addressing the issue at hand, as it suggests a method for safely incorporating the user's email into the password reset token generation process, even in cases where the user model might not follow the conventional `email` field naming.\n\nGiven this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using `get_email_field_name` and then include the value of this field in the hash value generated by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`. This approach ensures that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued password reset tokens, enhancing the security of the password reset process.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith this additional context, we have a clearer understanding of how to proceed with implementing a fix for the reported issue. The solution will involve modifying the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email address in the hash calculation. This modification will leverage the `get_email_field_name` method to accommodate user models that may not use the standard `email` field naming or might not have an email field at all.\n\nThe identified bug locations remain accurate, and with this analysis, we have a solid foundation for drafting the code changes needed to resolve the issue:\n\n- **Buggy File**: `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`\n\nThe next step would be to draft the specific code changes required to implement this solution, taking into account the flexibility of user model implementations in Django."
