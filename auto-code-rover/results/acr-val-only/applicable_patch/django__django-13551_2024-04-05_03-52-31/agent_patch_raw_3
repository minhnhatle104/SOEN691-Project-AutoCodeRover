Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the application of the patch or in the interpretation of the issue. Without direct feedback on the specific tests that failed or additional context on how the patch did not resolve the issue, crafting an accurate and effective patch is challenging. However, based on the initial problem statement and the structure of the Django authentication system, let's attempt a revised approach that focuses on ensuring compatibility and addresses potential concerns that might lead to test failures.

Considering the primary goal is to invalidate password reset tokens when a user's email changes, and the previous patches have not resolved the issue successfully, a more cautious and detailed approach is needed. Let's refine the patch with an emphasis on ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with Django's user model and authentication system.

# Revised Patch

```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>
<original>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):
        """
        Hash the user's primary key and some user state that's sure to change
        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it's
        used:
        1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
           same password is chosen, due to password salting).
        2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after
           a password reset.
        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
        invalidates the token.

        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking
        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn't compromised.
        """
        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the
        # database doesn't support microseconds.
        login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)</original>
<patched>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):
        """
        Hash the user's primary key, email, and some user state that's sure to change
        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it's
        used:
        1. The email field is included to ensure the token is invalidated if the email changes.
        2. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
           same password is chosen, due to password salting).
        3. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after

        """
        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the
        # database doesn't support microseconds.
        login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        # Ensure compatibility with user models that may not have an 'email' field
        email_field_name = 'email'  # Default field name for email
        if hasattr(user, 'get_email_field_name'):
            email_field_name = user.get_email_field_name()
        user_email = getattr(user, email_field_name, '')
        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp) + user_email</patched>
```

This revision takes a more conservative approach to retrieving the user's email address, directly incorporating compatibility checks for user models that may not follow the conventional structure or may not have an email field. It defaults to using 'email' as the field name but checks if the `get_email_field_name` method is available to determine the correct field name, accommodating custom user models. This approach aims to ensure that the patch does not introduce regressions or compatibility issues that could lead to test failures.

Without specific details on the test failures or additional constraints, this revised patch represents a best-effort solution based on the provided information and the structure of Django's authentication system.
