The identified buggy location is precise with respect to the issue of password reset tokens not being invalidated when a user's email address changes. \n\n- **Buggy File**: `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`\n\nThis method is responsible for generating a hash value that forms part of the password reset token. The issue stems from this method not including the user's email address in the hash value, which means that changing the email address does not invalidate existing tokens. \n\nGiven the information at hand, additional context from the project is not deemed necessary for addressing the issue as described. The solution involves modifying the `_make_hash_value` method to include the user's email address in the hash calculation, using the `get_email_field_name` method from the `AbstractBaseUser` class to accommodate different user model implementations. \n\nTherefore, no further search API calls are required at this stage for more context. The next step would involve proposing a code patch or modification strategy based on the identified bug location and the analysis conducted."
