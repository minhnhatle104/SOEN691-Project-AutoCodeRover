Given the feedback, let's revise the patch to ensure it addresses the issue effectively and passes the tests. The goal remains to include the user's email address in the hash value calculation for the password reset token, ensuring that any change to the email address invalidates previously issued tokens. 

Considering the structure of the Django user model and the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class, it's crucial to ensure that the patch correctly integrates with existing mechanisms for handling user data, particularly for models that may not have a standard email field. 

Here's a revised approach, taking into account the need for compatibility and correctness:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>
<original>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):
        """
        Hash the user's primary key and some user state that's sure to change
        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it's
        used:
        1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
           same password is chosen, due to password salting).
        2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after
           a password reset.
        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
        invalidates the token.

        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking
        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn't compromised.
        """
        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the
        # database doesn't support microseconds.
        login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)</original>
<patched>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):
        """
        Hash the user's primary key, email, and some user state that's sure to change
        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it's

        1. The email field is included to ensure the token is invalidated if the email changes.

        3. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after

        login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        # Correctly retrieve the email field name using the user model's method
        email_field_name = user.get_email_field_name() if hasattr(user, 'get_email_field_name') else 'email'
        user_email = getattr(user, email_field_name, '')
        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp) + user_email</patched>
```

This revision ensures that the patch is more cautious in retrieving the email field name, accounting for user models that might not implement the `get_email_field_name` method directly. It defaults to `'email'` if the method is not present, which should maintain compatibility with a wider range of user model implementations. Additionally, the user's email is appended at the end of the hash value string to minimize the risk of interfering with the existing format and logic.
