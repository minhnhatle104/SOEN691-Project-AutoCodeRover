2024-04-05 03:54:25 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the collected context from the search results, let's analyze the relevant parts of the codebase to address the issue described in the initial problem statement.\n\n### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\nLocated in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n\n### AbstractBaseUser Class\nLocated in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like `password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method `get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the password reset token issue.\n\n### Issue Analysis\nThe issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email address in the meantime.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nTo resolve this issue, the user's email address should be included in the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value` in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued password reset tokens, as the hash value will no longer match when the token is used.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all user models are guaranteed to have an email field, as mentioned in the issue description. The solution will need to account for this variability, possibly by checking if the user model has an email field and including it in the hash value only if it exists.\n\nIn the next steps, we would draft the code changes required to implement this solution, taking into account the structure and practices observed in the Django codebase.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

             "`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued "

It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model implementations while providing a standard way to reference the user's email field.\n\n### Implications for the Solution\nThe presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the email field across different user model implementations. This insight is directly relevant to addressing the issue at hand, as it suggests a method for safely incorporating the user's email into the password reset token generation process, even in cases where the user model might not follow the conventional `email` field naming.\n\nGiven this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using `get_email_field_name` and then include the value of this field in the hash value generated by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`. This approach ensures that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued password reset tokens, enhancing the security of the password reset process.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith this additional context, we have a clearer understanding of how to proceed with implementing a fix for the reported issue. The solution will involve modifying the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email address in the hash calculation. This modification will leverage the `get_email_field_name` method to accommodate user models that may not use the standard `email` field naming or might not have an email field at all.\n\nThe identified bug locations remain accurate, and with this analysis, we have a solid foundation for drafting the code changes needed to resolve the issue:\n\n- **Buggy File**: `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`\n\nThe next step would be to draft the specific code changes required to implement this solution, taking into account the flexibility of user model implementations in Django.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset '
             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "
             'value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n'

             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like '
             '`password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method '
             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '
             'password reset token issue.\n'

             '### Issue Analysis\n'
             'The issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the '
             "token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could "
             'potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email '
             'address in the meantime.\n'

             '### Proposed Solution\n'

             "`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued "

             '\n'
             '### Analysis of `get_email_field_name` Method\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `get_email_field_name` method attempts to return the name of the email field for the user '
             'model. It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` '
             "attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model "
             "implementations while providing a standard way to reference the user's email field.\n"

             '### Implications for the Solution\n'
             'The presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the '
             'email field across different user model implementations. This insight is directly relevant to addressing the issue at hand, as it suggests a '
             "method for safely incorporating the user's email into the password reset token generation process, even in cases where the user model might not "

             'Given this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using '

             'security of the password reset process.\n'

             '### Conclusion\n'
             'With this additional context, we have a clearer understanding of how to proceed with implementing a fix for the reported issue. The solution '
             "will involve modifying the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email address in the hash "

             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "

             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '

             '### Analysis of `get_email_field_name` Method\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `get_email_field_name` method attempts to return the name of the email field for the user '
             'model. It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` '

             '\n'
             '### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset '
             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "
             'value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### AbstractBaseUser Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like '
             '`password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method '
             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '
             'password reset token issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Issue Analysis\n'
             'The issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the '
             "token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could "
             'potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email '
             'address in the meantime.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Proposed Solution\n'
             "To resolve this issue, the user's email address should be included in the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value` in the "
             "`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued "
             'password reset tokens, as the hash value will no longer match when the token is used.\n'
             '\n'
             "However, it's important to note that not all user models are guaranteed to have an email field, as mentioned in the issue description. The "
             'solution will need to account for this variability, possibly by checking if the user model has an email field and including it in the hash value '
             'only if it exists.\n'
             '\n'

             '\n'
             '### Analysis of `get_email_field_name` Method\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `get_email_field_name` method attempts to return the name of the email field for the user '
             'model. It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` '
             "attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model "
             "implementations while providing a standard way to reference the user's email field.\n"
             '\n'
             '### Implications for the Solution\n'
             'The presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the '
             'email field across different user model implementations. This insight is directly relevant to addressing the issue at hand, as it suggests a '
             "method for safely incorporating the user's email into the password reset token generation process, even in cases where the user model might not "
             'follow the conventional `email` field naming.\n'
             '\n'
             'Given this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using '
             '`get_email_field_name` and then include the value of this field in the hash value generated by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`. '

             '### Conclusion\n'
             'With this additional context, we have a clearer understanding of how to proceed with implementing a fix for the reported issue. The solution '
             "will involve modifying the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email address in the hash "

             '\n'
             '### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset '
             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "
             'value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### AbstractBaseUser Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like '
             '`password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method '
             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '
             'password reset token issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Issue Analysis\n'
             'The issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the '
             "token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could "
             'potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email '
             'address in the meantime.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Proposed Solution\n'
             "To resolve this issue, the user's email address should be included in the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value` in the "
             "`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued "
             'password reset tokens, as the hash value will no longer match when the token is used.\n'
             '\n'
             "However, it's important to note that not all user models are guaranteed to have an email field, as mentioned in the issue description. The "
             'solution will need to account for this variability, possibly by checking if the user model has an email field and including it in the hash value '
             'only if it exists.\n'
             '\n'

             '### Analysis of `get_email_field_name` Method\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `get_email_field_name` method attempts to return the name of the email field for the user '
             'model. It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` '
             "attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model "

             '\n'
             '### Implications for the Solution\n'
             'The presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the '
             'email field across different user model implementations. This insight is directly relevant to addressing the issue at hand, as it suggests a '

             'Given this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using '

             'With this additional context, we have a clearer understanding of how to proceed with implementing a fix for the reported issue. The solution '

             '### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset '
             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "
             'value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### AbstractBaseUser Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like '
             '`password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method '
             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '
             'password reset token issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Issue Analysis\n'
             'The issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the '
             "token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could "
             'potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email '
             'address in the meantime.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Proposed Solution\n'
             "To resolve this issue, the user's email address should be included in the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value` in the "
             "`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued "
             'password reset tokens, as the hash value will no longer match when the token is used.\n'
             '\n'
             "However, it's important to note that not all user models are guaranteed to have an email field, as mentioned in the issue description. The "
             'solution will need to account for this variability, possibly by checking if the user model has an email field and including it in the hash value '
             'only if it exists.\n'

             'Given this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using '

             '\n'
             '### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset '
             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "
             'value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### AbstractBaseUser Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like '
             '`password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method '
             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '
             'password reset token issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Issue Analysis\n'
             'The issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the '
             "token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could "
             'potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email '
             'address in the meantime.\n'

             '\n'
             '### Analysis of `get_email_field_name` Method\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `get_email_field_name` method attempts to return the name of the email field for the user '
             'model. It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` '
             "attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model "

             'The presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the '

             'Given this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using '

             '### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset '
             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "
             'value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### AbstractBaseUser Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like '
             '`password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method '
             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '
             'password reset token issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Issue Analysis\n'
             'The issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the '
             "token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could "
             'potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email '
             'address in the meantime.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Proposed Solution\n'
             "To resolve this issue, the user's email address should be included in the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value` in the "
             "`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued "
             'password reset tokens, as the hash value will no longer match when the token is used.\n'
             '\n'
             "However, it's important to note that not all user models are guaranteed to have an email field, as mentioned in the issue description. The "
             'solution will need to account for this variability, possibly by checking if the user model has an email field and including it in the hash value '
             'only if it exists.\n'

             '### Analysis of `get_email_field_name` Method\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `get_email_field_name` method attempts to return the name of the email field for the user '

             "attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model "

             '\n'
             '### Implications for the Solution\n'
             'The presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the '
             'email field across different user model implementations. This insight is directly relevant to addressing the issue at hand, as it suggests a '

             'Given this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using '

             'initial problem statement.\n'
             '\n'
             '### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`, the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is responsible for generating and checking password reset '
             "tokens. The method `_make_hash_value` is particularly relevant to the issue. It currently hashes the user's primary key, the user's password, "
             "and the user's last login timestamp (if available) to generate a part of the token. This method ensures that if the user's password or last "
             "login changes, any previously generated token will be invalidated. However, it does not currently include the user's email address in the hash "
             'value, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### AbstractBaseUser Class\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `AbstractBaseUser` class serves as the base class for the user model. It includes fields like '
             '`password` and `last_login`, which are used by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` to generate the hash value for the token. The method '
             '`get_session_auth_hash` generates an HMAC of the password field, which is used for session authentication but is not directly related to the '
             'password reset token issue.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Issue Analysis\n'
             'The issue arises when a user changes their email address after a password reset token has been issued but before it has been used. Since the '
             "token's hash value does not currently depend on the user's email address, changing the email does not invalidate the token. This behavior could "
             'potentially be exploited in scenarios where an attacker gains access to an unused password reset token and the user has changed their email '
             'address in the meantime.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Proposed Solution\n'
             "To resolve this issue, the user's email address should be included in the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value` in the "
             "`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This change will ensure that any change to the user's email address will invalidate previously issued "
             'password reset tokens, as the hash value will no longer match when the token is used.\n'
             '\n'
             "However, it's important to note that not all user models are guaranteed to have an email field, as mentioned in the issue description. The "
             'solution will need to account for this variability, possibly by checking if the user model has an email field and including it in the hash value '
             'only if it exists.\n'
             '\n'
             'In the next steps, we would draft the code changes required to implement this solution, taking into account the structure and practices observed '
             'in the Django codebase.'},

             '\n'
             '### Analysis of `get_email_field_name` Method\n'
             'Located in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`, the `get_email_field_name` method attempts to return the name of the email field for the user '
             'model. It first looks for a class attribute `EMAIL_FIELD` to determine if a custom email field name has been specified. If the `EMAIL_FIELD` '
             "attribute does not exist (caught by an `AttributeError`), it defaults to `'email'`. This mechanism allows for flexibility in user model "

             'The presence of the `get_email_field_name` method confirms that the Django framework anticipates variability in the naming and presence of the '
             'email field across different user model implementations. This insight is directly relevant to addressing the issue at hand, as it suggests a '
             "method for safely incorporating the user's email into the password reset token generation process, even in cases where the user model might not "

             '\n'
             'Given this understanding, the solution to the issue can be designed to first determine the name of the email field (if any) using '
             '`get_email_field_name` and then include the value of this field in the hash value generated by `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`. '

             'With this additional context, we have a clearer understanding of how to proceed with implementing a fix for the reported issue. The solution '
             "will involve modifying the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email address in the hash "

Then, it retrieves the email value using `getattr` and includes it in the hash. This approach ensures that the patch is flexible and can handle custom user models that may not use the standard `email` field name.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

2024-04-05 03:57:57 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Given the feedback, let\'s revise the patch to ensure it addresses the issue effectively and passes the tests. The goal remains to include the user\'s email address in the hash value calculation for the password reset token, ensuring that any change to the email address invalidates previously issued tokens. \n\nConsidering the structure of the Django user model and the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class, it\'s crucial to ensure that the patch correctly integrates with existing mechanisms for handling user data, particularly for models that may not have a standard email field. \n\nHere\'s a revised approach, taking into account the need for compatibility and correctness:\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>\n<original>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n        """\n        Hash the user\'s primary key and some user state that\'s sure to change\n        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it\'s\n        used:\n        1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the\n           same password is chosen, due to password salting).\n        2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after\n           a password reset.\n        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually\n        invalidates the token.\n\n        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking\n        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn\'t compromised.\n        """\n        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the\n        # database doesn\'t support microseconds.\n        login_timestamp = \'\' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)</original>\n<patched>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n        """\n        Hash the user\'s primary key, email, and some user state that\'s sure to change\n        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it\'s\n        used:\n        1. The email field is included to ensure the token is invalidated if the email changes.\n        2. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the\n           same password is chosen, due to password salting).\n        3. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after\n           a password reset.\n        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually\n        invalidates the token.\n\n        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking\n        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn\'t compromised.\n        """\n        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the\n        # database doesn\'t support microseconds.\n        login_timestamp = \'\' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n        # Correctly retrieve the email field name using the user model\'s method\n        email_field_name = user.get_email_field_name() if hasattr(user, \'get_email_field_name\') else \'email\'\n        user_email = getattr(user, email_field_name, \'\')\n        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp) + user_email</patched>\n```\n\nThis revision ensures that the patch is more cautious in retrieving the email field name, accounting for user models that might not implement the `get_email_field_name` method directly. It defaults to `\'email\'` if the method is not present, which should maintain compatibility with a wider range of user model implementations. Additionally, the user\'s email is appended at the end of the hash value string to minimize the risk of interfering with the existing format and logic.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

2024-04-05 03:58:52 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the application of the patch or in the interpretation of the issue. Without direct feedback on the specific tests that failed or additional context on how the patch did not resolve the issue, crafting an accurate and effective patch is challenging. However, based on the initial problem statement and the structure of the Django authentication system, let\'s attempt a revised approach that focuses on ensuring compatibility and addresses potential concerns that might lead to test failures.\n\nConsidering the primary goal is to invalidate password reset tokens when a user\'s email changes, and the previous patches have not resolved the issue successfully, a more cautious and detailed approach is needed. Let\'s refine the patch with an emphasis on ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with Django\'s user model and authentication system.\n\n# Revised Patch\n\n```python\n<file>django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>\n<original>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n        """\n        Hash the user\'s primary key and some user state that\'s sure to change\n        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it\'s\n        used:\n        1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the\n           same password is chosen, due to password salting).\n        2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after\n           a password reset.\n        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually\n        invalidates the token.\n\n        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking\n        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn\'t compromised.\n        """\n        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the\n        # database doesn\'t support microseconds.\n        login_timestamp = \'\' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)</original>\n<patched>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n        """\n        Hash the user\'s primary key, email, and some user state that\'s sure to change\n        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it\'s\n        used:\n        1. The email field is included to ensure the token is invalidated if the email changes.\n        2. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the\n           same password is chosen, due to password salting).\n        3. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after\n           a password reset.\n        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually\n        invalidates the token.\n\n        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking\n        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn\'t compromised.\n        """\n        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the\n        # database doesn\'t support microseconds.\n        login_timestamp = \'\' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n        # Ensure compatibility with user models that may not have an \'email\' field\n        email_field_name = \'email\'  # Default field name for email\n        if hasattr(user, \'get_email_field_name\'):\n            email_field_name = user.get_email_field_name()\n        user_email = getattr(user, email_field_name, \'\')\n        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp) + user_email</patched>\n```\n\nThis revision takes a more conservative approach to retrieving the user\'s email address, directly incorporating compatibility checks for user models that may not follow the conventional structure or may not have an email field. It defaults to using \'email\' as the field name but checks if the `get_email_field_name` method is available to determine the correct field name, accommodating custom user models. This approach aims to ensure that the patch does not introduce regressions or compatibility issues that could lead to test failures.\n\nWithout specific details on the test failures or additional constraints, this revised patch represents a best-effort solution based on the provided information and the structure of Django\'s authentication system.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
