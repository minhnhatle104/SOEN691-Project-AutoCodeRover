My responses are based on the information you've shared and the results from the search API calls you've requested.\n\nGiven the constraints, the identified buggy location within the context of our discussion is as precise as possible:\n\n- **Buggy File**: `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`\n\nThis method is identified based on the issue description regarding the password reset tokens not being invalidated when a user's email changes. The proposed solution involves modifying this method to include the user's email in the hash value calculation to ensure tokens are invalidated when the email changes.\n\nIf the identification of the buggy locations is considered not precise, it may be due to limitations in our interaction or a misunderstanding of the project's structure based on the provided information. For further action, direct inspection of the codebase, collaboration with team members, or additional specific queries about the project's structure might be necessary to achieve the desired level of precision."
