This patch revises the `sign` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` to address the issue of rewriting the sign function in terms of `Abs`. It introduces a check for zero (`e.is_zero`) and returns `S.NaN` (Sympy's representation of "Not a Number") for this case, aligning with the suggestion that `sign(0)` could be considered undefined (`nan`). For non-zero cases, it computes the sign as `e / Abs(e)`, directly implementing the mathematical definition provided in the issue description. This approach ensures that the function's behavior is consistent with mathematical conventions while incorporating the requested feature.
