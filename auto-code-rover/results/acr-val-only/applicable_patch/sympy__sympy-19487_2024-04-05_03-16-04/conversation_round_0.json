There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:\n```\n>>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)\nx\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2502x\u2502\n```\nI'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have\n```\n>>> sign(0)\n0\n>>> 0 / Abs(0)\nnan\n```\nMaybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n</issue>"
