```

This patch modifies the `sign` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` to rewrite the sign calculation in terms of `Abs`, as requested in the issue. It maintains the explicit handling of the zero case to avoid division by zero, returning `0` when `e.is_zero` evaluates to True. For non-zero cases, it computes the sign as `e / Abs(e)`, aligning with the mathematical definition provided in the issue description. This approach ensures that the function's behavior remains consistent with the existing implementation while incorporating the requested feature.
