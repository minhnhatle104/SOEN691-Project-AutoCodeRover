Given the context and the issue described, the patch should ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` is properly applied to variables and attributes during the documentation process. Since the detailed implementation of how `autodoc_type_aliases` is applied or should be applied is not directly visible in the provided code snippet, the patch will focus on a conceptual solution based on the typical handling of such configurations in Sphinx.

The `document_members` method in the `Documenter` class seems to be a key point where member documentation is initiated. However, without explicit handling of `autodoc_type_aliases` for variables and attributes shown in the provided snippet, we'll assume that enhancing this part to respect `autodoc_type_aliases` for such members could address the issue.

Please note, the actual implementation might require deeper integration and testing with Sphinx's autodoc extension system. This patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue.

<patched># Enhanced to apply autodoc_type_aliases to variables and attributes
def apply_type_aliases_to_members(members):
    for member in members:
        if member.name in autodoc_type_aliases:
            member.type = autodoc_type_aliases[member.name]

apply_type_aliases_to_members(self.get_members(all_members, not self.options.inherited_members))
self.document_members(all_members)</patched>
```

This patch introduces a hypothetical function `apply_type_aliases_to_members` that iterates over members to be documented, checks if their names are present in the `autodoc_type_aliases` dictionary, and applies the alias type if found. This function is called before the actual documentation of members (`self.document_members(all_members)`) to ensure that type aliases are applied.

Keep in mind, the actual implementation of `get_members` and how members are represented (e.g., the existence of `member.name` and `member.type`) would need to be aligned with Sphinx's internal representations. This patch is illustrative and assumes a simplified view of how members might be handled.

For a real-world solution, one would need to dive deeper into the Sphinx codebase, particularly how `autodoc_type_aliases` is intended to be used, and ensure that any modifications are compatible with Sphinx's overall architecture and existing functionalities.
