Given the constraints and the complexity of the issue with `autodoc_type_aliases` not affecting variables and attributes as expected in Sphinx, and considering the limitations of the provided context and the failed attempt to directly address the issue with a hypothetical patch, it's clear that a different approach is necessary. Without the ability to directly interact with the Sphinx codebase or run tests to validate the changes, we're limited to conceptual solutions.

However, based on the understanding of Sphinx's documentation process and the common patterns in handling such configurations, I can suggest a conceptual approach that might guide towards a solution. This approach would involve ensuring that the `autodoc_type_aliases` are checked and applied at a point in the code where member types are resolved before documentation is generated.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

1. **Identify Where Member Types are Resolved**: The first step is to identify where in the Sphinx autodoc process the types of members (variables and attributes) are resolved. This could be during the import and analysis of the module or right before the documentation is generated.

2. **Intercept and Apply Type Aliases**: Once the point of type resolution is identified, the next step is to intercept this process and apply the type aliases as defined in `autodoc_type_aliases`. This might involve modifying a method or function responsible for type resolution to check the `autodoc_type_aliases` mapping and apply any aliases found.

3. **Ensure Compatibility with Existing Documentation Process**: Any changes made to apply `autodoc_type_aliases` should be compatible with the existing documentation process, ensuring that it does not interfere with other autodoc features or extensions.

### Hypothetical Code Snippet

Since we cannot provide a direct patch without access to the specific implementation details and without knowing the exact point in the code where member types are resolved, below is a highly conceptual and simplified code snippet illustrating the approach:

```python
# This is a conceptual snippet and not a direct patch
def resolve_member_type(member_name, member_type):
    # Assuming there's a global or accessible mapping of autodoc_type_aliases
    global autodoc_type_aliases
    if member_type in autodoc_type_aliases:
        return autodoc_type_aliases[member_type]
    return member_type

def document_member(member):
    # Hypothetical function to document a single member
    resolved_type = resolve_member_type(member.name, member.type)
    # Proceed with documentation using the resolved type
```

### Next Steps

- **Deep Dive into Sphinx Autodoc Implementation**: To move forward with a real solution, a detailed examination of the Sphinx autodoc source code is necessary, focusing on how member documentation is generated and where types are resolved.

- **Collaboration with Sphinx Community**: Given the complexity of the issue and the potential for wide-ranging impacts of any changes, collaborating with the Sphinx community, including discussing the issue on Sphinx's issue tracker or mailing lists, could provide additional insights and guidance.

- **Testing and Validation**: Any proposed changes should be thoroughly tested, including adding new tests to cover the scenario described in the issue to ensure that the solution is effective and does not introduce regressions.

This conceptual approach aims to provide a direction for further investigation and potential resolution of the issue with `autodoc_type_aliases` in Sphinx.
