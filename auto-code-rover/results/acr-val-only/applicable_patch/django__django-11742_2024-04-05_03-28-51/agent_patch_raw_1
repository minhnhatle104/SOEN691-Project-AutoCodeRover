# Patch to ensure max_length fits the longest choice
if self.choices and self.max_length is not None:
    max_choice_length = max(len(choice[0]) for choice in self.choices)
    if max_choice_length > self.max_length:
        raise ValueError(f"Field '{self.name}' max_length={self.max_length} is too small for the longest choice '{max_choice_length}'.")</patched>
```

This patch adds a validation step right after the `choices` are set in the `Field` class's `__init__` method. It checks if `choices` are provided and `max_length` is defined. If so, it calculates the maximum length of the choices and compares it with the `max_length` of the field. If `max_length` is smaller than the longest choice, it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message. This ensures that the developer is immediately aware of the configuration mistake, preventing runtime errors related to field length constraints in the database.
