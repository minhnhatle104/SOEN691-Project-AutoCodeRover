This patch introduces a helper function `make_pickleable` within the `_combine` method to convert non-pickleable objects, specifically `dict_keys`, into a pickleable format (in this case, a list) before the `Q` object is deep-copied. This approach aims to address the issue where using `dict_keys` within `Q` objects leads to a "TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object" when attempting to perform operations that involve serialization, such as using the `|` operator. The conversion is applied to the `children` attribute of `Q` objects, which is where the query conditions are stored.
