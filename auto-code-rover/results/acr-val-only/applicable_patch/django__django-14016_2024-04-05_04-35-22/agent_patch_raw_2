Given the feedback, it appears the initial approach might not directly address the root cause of the issue or might introduce other problems. Let's consider a different approach that focuses on the serialization process itself, rather than altering the data structure at the point of combining `Q` objects. This approach aims to ensure that serialization issues are handled more gracefully, without altering the logical structure or expected behavior of the `Q` objects.

        # If the other Q() is empty, ignore it and just use `self`.
        if not other:
            return copy.deepcopy(self)
        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.
        elif not self:
            return copy.deepcopy(other)

        obj = type(self)()
        obj.connector = conn
        obj.add(self, conn)
        obj.add(other, conn)
        return obj

        # Custom deepcopy function to handle non-pickleable objects
        def custom_deepcopy(obj):
            try:
                return copy.deepcopy(obj)
            except TypeError:
                # Attempt to convert dict_keys to list if deepcopy fails
                if isinstance(obj, dict_keys):
                    return list(obj)
                raise

        # If the other Q() is empty, ignore it and just use `self`.
        if not other:
            return custom_deepcopy(self)
        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.
        elif not self:
            return custom_deepcopy(other)

        obj = type(self)()
        obj.connector = conn
        obj.add(self, conn)
        obj.add(other, conn)
        return obj
</patched>
```

This revised patch introduces a `custom_deepcopy` function within the `_combine` method. This function attempts a regular deep copy operation but catches `TypeError` exceptions that occur when encountering non-pickleable objects. Specifically, it checks if the problematic object is of type `dict_keys`, and if so, converts it to a list, which is pickleable. This approach targets the serialization issue more directly by providing a fallback mechanism for deep copying operations that fail due to non-pickleable objects. It's a more targeted solution that attempts to preserve the original behavior and data structures of `Q` objects while addressing the specific serialization issue highlighted in the bug report.
