Specifically, we need to look into the implementation of the `Q` class to see how it handles the `|` operator and how it deals with pickleability of objects like `dict_keys`. Let's start by searching for the `Q` class and the methods that might be involved in the operation mentioned in the issue.\n\n- `search_class(\"Q\")`: This will help us find the file and location where the `Q` class is defined.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__or__\", \"Q\")`: Since the `|` operator is essentially the `__or__` method in Python, this search will help us find the implementation of the `|` operator for the `Q` object."
