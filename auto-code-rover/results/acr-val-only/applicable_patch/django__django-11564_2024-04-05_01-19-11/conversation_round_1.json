When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.\nThis problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.\nThis can be easily added into default Django static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:\ndef render(self, context):\nurl = self.url(context)\n# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME']\nif self.varname is None:\nreturn url\ncontext[self.varname] = url\nreturn ''\nOn more research I found that FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage ignores SCRIPT_NAME as well.\nWe might have to do a lot of changes but I think it's worth the efforts.\n</issue>"

Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"render\")` - Since the issue description provides a snippet of a `render` method that seems to be part of the solution, searching for this method could help us find where to apply the fix. However, `render` might be a common method name across different components, so this search might return multiple results.\n\n2. `search_class(\"FileSystemStorage\")` - This will help us find the file and the implementation details of the `FileSystemStorage` class, which is mentioned as ignoring `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\n3. `search_class(\"StaticFilesStorage\")` - Similar to `FileSystemStorage`, this will help us find the implementation details of the `StaticFilesStorage` class.\n\n4. `search_code(\"{% static '...' %}\")` - This search will help us find the implementation or usage of the static tag within the codebase, which is crucial for understanding how `STATIC_URL` is currently being handled.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the issue and how they interact with `STATIC_URL` and `MEDIA_URL`."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered significant context about the components involved in the issue:\n\n1. **`render` Method**: The search for the `render` method returned 68 matches across various files. Notably, there are 2 matches in `django/templatetags/static.py`, which is likely where the `{% static '...' %}` tag is implemented. Given the context of the issue, this file is a prime candidate for further investigation to address the problem with the static tag not correctly handling `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\n2. **`FileSystemStorage` Class**: Found in `django/core/files/storage.py`, this class provides a way to store and retrieve files in the filesystem. The class has methods like `url`, which might be relevant for generating URLs for stored files. Since the issue mentions that `FileSystemStorage` ignores `SCRIPT_NAME`, we should look into how the `url` method or other relevant methods construct URLs and consider how they might be modified to respect `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\n3. **`StaticFilesStorage` Class**: This class, found in `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py`, inherits from `FileSystemStorage` and likely provides additional functionality specific to handling static files. The issue's mention of this class suggests that its method(s) for generating URLs for static files may also need to be adjusted to account for `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\n4. **`{% static '...' %}` Tag**: The search did not find direct references to this template tag in the codebase, which could be due to the nature of template tag syntax or limitations in the search capability. However, the presence of relevant files under `django/templatetags/`, especially `static.py`, suggests that's where the implementation resides.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps involve diving deeper into the implementation details of the `django/templatetags/static.py` file to understand how the `{% static '...' %}` tag constructs URLs. Additionally, examining the `url` methods (or similar) in both `FileSystemStorage` and `StaticFilesStorage` will be crucial to propose a solution that ensures `SCRIPT_NAME` is appropriately prepended to URLs, addressing the issue for dynamic and static files alike.\n\nTo proceed, we should focus on:\n- The implementation of the `{% static '...' %}` tag in `django/templatetags/static.py` to identify where and how the URL is constructed.\n- The `url` method in `FileSystemStorage` and `StaticFilesStorage` to understand the current logic for URL construction and identify where adjustments are needed to incorporate `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\nThis analysis will guide the development of patches to resolve the issue."
