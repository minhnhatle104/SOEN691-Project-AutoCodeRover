Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears that a direct code patch cannot be provided without further access to the Matplotlib codebase and the ability to perform tests. The issue with `set_visible()` not working as expected for 3D projections in Matplotlib likely involves a deeper investigation into how visibility is managed for 3D axes and their components.

To address the issue, I recommend the following steps for contributors with access to the Matplotlib codebase:

1. **Investigate the Implementation of `set_visible()` for 3D Axes**: Start by reviewing how the `set_visible()` method is implemented specifically for the `Axes3D` class. It's possible that the method does not correctly propagate visibility changes to all components of the 3D plot (e.g., axes, labels, ticks).

2. **Review Parent Class Behavior**: Since `Axes3D` inherits from the general `Axes` class, it's important to understand how visibility is managed in the parent class and ensure that any overrides in `Axes3D` maintain consistent behavior.

3. **Test Visibility Propagation**: Create unit tests to verify that setting visibility to `False` on a 3D axis correctly hides all visual components of the axis. This includes not only the axis lines but also labels, ticks, and any plotted data.

4. **Ensure Consistency Across Plot Types**: Verify that the behavior of `set_visible()` is consistent between 2D and 3D plots, to the extent that it makes sense. Users expect similar methods to behave consistently across different types of plots.

5. **Update Documentation**: If the behavior of `set_visible()` for 3D plots intentionally differs from 2D plots, or if there are specific considerations to keep in mind, update the Matplotlib documentation to clearly reflect this.

Due to the limitations in directly providing a code patch, these recommendations aim to guide further investigation and resolution of the issue by contributors who can modify and test the Matplotlib codebase.
