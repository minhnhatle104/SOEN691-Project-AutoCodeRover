```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that when `set_visible(False)` is called on a 3D axis, it not only sets the visibility of the axis itself but also iterates through all child artists (e.g., lines, markers, etc.) and sets their visibility to False as well. This ensures consistent visibility behavior similar to 2D plots. Additionally, the `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on` methods are updated to call `set_visible` to manage the visibility state of the axis and its children comprehensively.
