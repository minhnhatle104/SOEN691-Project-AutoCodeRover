Given the feedback and the need to revise the patch to ensure it resolves the issue without causing test failures, let's re-examine the implementation and make necessary adjustments. The goal is to ensure that `id_for_label` correctly uses the `id` provided in the widget's attributes if available. It's crucial that this change does not negatively impact other functionalities or existing tests.

Considering the structure of the `BoundWidget` class and its `id_for_label` method, it's possible that the initial patch did not account for all scenarios or the structure of `self.data['attrs']`. Let's attempt a more careful and compatible approach.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/forms/boundfield.py</file>
<original>    def id_for_label(self):
        return 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])
</original>
<patched>    def id_for_label(self):
        # Attempt to use the 'id' attribute from the widget's attributes if present.
        # This ensures compatibility with widgets that specify an 'id' explicitly.
        id_attr = self.data.get('attrs', {}).get('id')
        if id_attr:
            return id_attr
        # Fallback to the default behavior if 'id' is not specified.
        return 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])
</patched>
```

This revised patch introduces a more cautious approach to accessing `self.data['attrs']['id']`, ensuring that we first check if `self.data` and `self.data['attrs']` are properly structured to avoid any KeyError or similar issues that could arise. This should maintain compatibility with existing tests and functionalities while addressing the issue described.
