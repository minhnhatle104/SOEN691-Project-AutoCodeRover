Given the error message originates from `text.py`, it\'s likely related to how message templates are parsed or handled in the output formatting process. \n\nLet\'s start by investigating the relevant parts of the Pylint codebase:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles the output formatting, which might be responsible for processing the `--msg-template` argument. Since the error message is coming from `text.py`, it\'s reasonable to assume the class we\'re looking for is in this file.

2024-04-05 04:25:16 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Given the results indicating that the file `site-packages/pylint/reporters/text.py` could not be found in the codebase, it\'s possible that the file path provided in the issue description does not exactly match the structure of the Pylint codebase in the repository. This discrepancy could be due to several reasons, such as changes in the codebase structure between versions, or a misunderstanding of the file\'s location.\n\nTo proceed, we need to adjust our approach to gather more context about how Pylint processes the `--msg-template` argument and generates output based on it. Since the direct search for the specific file and method did not yield results, we should consider broader searches that could help us identify the relevant components involved in this functionality. Here are a few steps we can take:\n\n1. **Broaden the Search for Message Template Processing**: Since the direct file path didn\'t yield results, we might need to search more broadly for how Pylint handles the `--msg-template` argument across the entire codebase. This could involve searching for classes or methods that are likely to be involved in parsing command-line arguments or formatting output messages.\n\n2. **Investigate Changes Between Versions**: The issue mentions that the functionality worked as expected in Pylint 1.7.4 but not in 2.12.2. Investigating the changes made to argument parsing or message formatting between these versions could provide insights into why the behavior changed.\n\nGiven these considerations, let\'s perform a broader search to try and locate the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n- `search_method("parse_args")`: This search aims to find methods involved in parsing command-line arguments, which could lead us to how the `--msg-template` argument is handled.\n\n- `search_code("--msg-template")`: By searching the entire codebase for references to the `--msg-template` argument, we might find clues about where and how it\'s processed, even if the specific file path mentioned in the issue doesn\'t match.\n\nThese searches are designed to provide a broader view of how Pylint processes the `--msg-template` argument and might help us identify the components involved in the issue.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

2024-04-05 04:25:46 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the search results, we have identified that references to `--msg-template` are found in several files within the Pylint codebase. Specifically, these references appear in `pylint/epylint.py`, `pylint/reporters/text.py`, and `tests/test_epylint.py`. This information is crucial as it provides us with potential locations where the bug could reside or where the handling of the `--msg-template` argument is implemented.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n1. **pylint/epylint.py**: This file likely deals with the external interface of Pylint, possibly including how command-line arguments are handled or passed to the core linting functionality. The presence of `--msg-template` here suggests that part of the argument parsing or validation might occur in this file.\n\n2. **pylint/reporters/text.py**: The initial issue description mentioned this file in the context of a warning being issued about the unrecognized `--msg-template` argument. Finding matches here confirms that this file is involved in processing or utilizing the `--msg-template` argument, likely in the context of formatting linting output. This file is a strong candidate for containing the bug or the changed behavior between versions.\n\n3. **tests/test_epylint.py**: The presence of `--msg-template` in test files is expected, as these would include tests verifying the correct handling and output formatting based on the `--msg-template` argument. While not likely the location of the bug itself, these tests could provide insights into expected behaviors and how those might have changed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the information gathered, we can conclude that the handling of the `--msg-template` argument and the potential bug are most likely located in `pylint/reporters/text.py`. This file is directly related to output reporting, where the described issue manifests. Additionally, `pylint/epylint.py` could contain relevant code for how the argument is parsed or passed to the reporting functionality.\n\n- **where are bug locations**: \n  - **Buggy files and methods**: The bug is likely located in `pylint/reporters/text.py`, given the direct reference to this file in the issue description and the search results indicating it contains relevant code snippets. Without specific method names from the search results, we can't pinpoint the exact methods, but it's reasonable to focus on methods in `text.py` that handle or utilize the `--msg-template` argument. `pylint/epylint.py` may also contain relevant code for argument handling that could contribute to the issue.\n\nFurther investigation into these files, especially `pylint/reporters/text.py`, is needed to identify the exact methods and lines of code responsible for the issue. Adjustments or fixes would likely involve ensuring that custom braces in message templates are correctly interpreted and displayed in the output, as they were in previous versions of Pylint.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Since further search API calls were not directly requested or provided with specific arguments previously, and based on the information at hand, it seems we have reached a conclusion without the need for additional search API calls. \n\nHowever, to clarify and correct any misunderstanding, let's proceed under the assumption that we might still benefit from more detailed investigation into the specific files identified. Given the limitations of our current approach, I'll outline hypothetical steps that would be taken next, without invoking actual search API calls due to the nature of this interaction:\n\n1. **Manual Review of `pylint/reporters/text.py`**: Since this file has been identified as containing references to `--msg-template` and is related to the issue reported, a manual review of its contents would be the next logical step. This review would focus on understanding how message templates are parsed and formatted, and identifying any changes or regressions in behavior from previous versions.\n\n2. **Investigation into `pylint/epylint.py`**: Although not directly implicated in the error message, this file's handling of command-line arguments, including `--msg-template`, could provide context or reveal indirect causes of the issue.\n\n3. **Examination of Test Cases in `tests/test_epylint.py`**: Reviewing the test cases that involve `--msg-template` might offer insights into expected behaviors and how they are verified, which could be useful for identifying discrepancies in the current implementation.\n\nGiven the constraints of our current setup, these steps are suggested as the next course of action for someone with access to the Pylint codebase and the ability to manually inspect and modify the code.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

2024-04-05 04:28:19 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="The search results provide valuable insights into how the `--msg-template` argument is handled within Pylint, specifically within the `pylint/reporters/text.py` and `pylint/epylint.py` files. Let's analyze the context provided by these search results.\n\n### pylint/reporters/text.py\n\n1. **TextReporter class, on_set_current_module function**:\n   - This snippet indicates that there's a check for whether an argument provided to `--msg-template` is recognized as a valid message field. If an argument is not found in `MESSAGE_FIELDS`, a warning is issued. This could be a critical part of understanding why custom braces in the message template do not work as expected. The issue might stem from the handling of message fields or the recognition of custom arguments within braces.\n\n2. **ParseableTextReporter class, __init__ function**:\n   - This snippet shows a deprecation warning being issued for using a specific output format, mentioning that it's equivalent to using a certain `--msg-template`. While this might not directly relate to the bug, it indicates the importance of `--msg-template` in defining output formats and the potential impacts of deprecations on its functionality.\n\n### pylint/epylint.py\n\n1. **lint function**:\n   - Here, `--msg-template` is used as part of a command that seems to be constructing a linting command. This snippet provides a default message template format. It suggests that `--msg-template` is integral to how Pylint formats its lint messages and that there's a predefined format being used, which might conflict with or not fully support custom formats.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe issue described in the bug report seems to be closely related to the first search result from `pylint/reporters/text.py`. The warning issued for unrecognized arguments in the `--msg-template` suggests that the handling or validation of these arguments might have changed, leading to the observed behavior where custom braces do not work as expected.\n\nGiven this context, the bug's location is likely within the **TextReporter class's on_set_current_module function** in `pylint/reporters/text.py`. The problem might involve how arguments within the `--msg-template` are validated against `MESSAGE_FIELDS`.

2024-04-05 04:29:00 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Understanding the need to preserve the user\'s intended template while also ensuring that only valid fields are used, a more refined approach is required. The issue arises from the method stripping out unrecognized arguments, which could be valid for custom usage scenarios. To address this without breaking existing functionality or tests, we can modify the approach to log a warning without removing the unrecognized arguments from the template. This way, users are informed about potential issues with their template, but their custom formatting is preserved.\n\nHere\'s an updated patch that aims to balance between warning the user about potentially unrecognized arguments and preserving custom template arguments:\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>pylint/reporters/text.py</file>\n<original>                warnings.warn(\n                    f"Don\'t recognize the argument \'{argument[0]}\' in the --msg-template.

"\n                    "Custom arguments are allowed but may not be processed as expected."\n                )</patched>\n```\n\nThis modification removes the line that strips out the unrecognized arguments from the template, thus preserving the user\'s custom formatting. Instead, it updates the warning message to inform the user that while custom arguments are allowed, they may not be processed as expected if they are not recognized by Pylint. This approach ensures that users are made aware of potential issues with their custom templates without forcibly removing parts of their specified formatting.\n\nThis patch assumes that the rest of the Pylint system can handle or ignore these custom arguments without causing errors in the linting process. If further issues arise from unrecognized arguments being present in the template, additional handling logic may be required elsewhere in the code to gracefully ignore or process these custom arguments.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

To resolve this, we need a solution that maintains the integrity of the message template processing while allowing for flexibility with custom formats.\n\nSince the direct modification approach to allow unrecognized arguments did not resolve the issue effectively, let\'s consider an alternative strategy. We can introduce a mechanism to bypass the warning and removal for specific custom formats by marking them explicitly in the template. This approach requires minimal changes to the existing logic and ensures backward compatibility.\n\nHere\'s a conceptual patch that introduces a simple way to mark custom fields in the template, which the processing logic can then recognize and handle appropriately:\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>pylint/reporters/text.py</file>\n<original>        for argument in arguments:\n            if argument[0] not in MESSAGE_FIELDS:\n                warnings.warn(\n                    f"Don\'t recognize the argument \'{argument[0]}\' in the --msg-template. "\n                    "Are you sure it is supported on the current version of pylint?"\n                )\n                template = re.sub(r"\\{" + argument[0] + r"(:.*?)?\\}", "", template)</original>\n<patched>        for argument in arguments:\n            # Check if the argument is marked as custom to bypass the check\n            if argument[0].startswith(\'custom:\'):\n                continue  # Bypass the check for custom-marked arguments\n            elif argument[0] not in MESSAGE_FIELDS:\n                warnings.warn(\n                    f"Don\'t recognize the argument \'{argument[0]}\' in the --msg-template. "\n                    "Are you sure it is supported on the current version of pylint?"\n                )\n                template = re.sub(r"\\{" + argument[0] + r"(:.*?)?\\}", "", template)</patched>\n```\n\nIn this patch, users can mark custom fields in their `--msg-template` by prefixing them with `custom:` (e.g., `{custom:MyCustomField}`). This prefix acts as a signal to bypass the unrecognized argument check and warning, allowing users to include custom fields in their templates without them being stripped out or causing warnings. This approach provides a clear pathway for extending the template with custom fields while maintaining compatibility with existing validation logic.\n\nThis solution assumes that users are willing to explicitly mark their custom fields and that the rest of the Pylint system does not need to process these custom fields in any specific way. It offers a balance between flexibility for users and maintaining the integrity of the message template processing system.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
