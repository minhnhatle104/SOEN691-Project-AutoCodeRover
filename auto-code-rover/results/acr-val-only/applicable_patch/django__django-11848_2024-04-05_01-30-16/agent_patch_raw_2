Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to ensure it aligns more closely with the RFC7231 guidelines and corrects the logic flaw in handling two-digit years. The goal is to interpret a two-digit year in a way that if it appears to be more than 50 years in the future, it should be considered as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/utils/http.py</file>
<original>if year < 100:
    if year < 70:
        year += 2000
    else:
        year += 1900</original>
<patched>if year < 100:
    # Get the current year
    current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
    # Calculate the full year assuming it's in the current century
    assumed_year = current_year - (current_year % 100) + year
    # If the assumed_year is more than 50 years in the future, subtract 100 years
    if assumed_year - current_year > 50:
        year = assumed_year - 100
    else:
        year = assumed_year</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a different approach to determine the correct century for a two-digit year. It first assumes the year is in the current century and then checks if this assumption places the year more than 50 years in the future. If so, it adjusts the year to be in the previous century. This method dynamically calculates the correct century based on the current year, ensuring compliance with RFC7231's guidelines for handling two-digit years.
