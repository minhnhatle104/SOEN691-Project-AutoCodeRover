Understanding the feedback and the need for a correct approach, let's refine the logic to adhere strictly to the RFC7231 guidelines regarding two-digit years. The goal is to ensure that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future is interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/utils/http.py</file>
<original>if year < 100:
    if year < 70:
        year += 2000
    else:
        year += 1900</original>
<patched>if year < 100:
    # Determine the current year
    current_year = datetime.datetime.utcnow().year
    # Calculate the century for the two-digit year
    # First, assume the year is in the current century
    century = current_year - (current_year % 100)
    assumed_year = century + year
    # If the assumed year is more than 50 years in the future, adjust to the previous century
    if assumed_year > current_year + 50:
        assumed_year -= 100
    # If the assumed year is in the past but more than 50 years ago, adjust to the next century
    elif assumed_year < current_year - 50:
        assumed_year += 100
    year = assumed_year</patched>
```

This patch revises the logic for handling two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function. It first assumes the year is in the current century and then checks if this assumption places the year more than 50 years in the future or in the past but more than 50 years ago, adjusting the century accordingly. This dynamic calculation ensures that the interpretation of two-digit years aligns with the guidelines set forth in RFC7231, aiming to resolve the issue without causing further test failures.
