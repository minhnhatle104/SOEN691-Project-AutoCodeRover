    # Calculate the century offset based on the comparison
    if (year > current_year_last_two and (year - current_year_last_two) > 50) or (year < current_year_last_two and (current_year_last_two - year) <= 50):

This patch modifies the logic for determining the century of a year when only the last two digits are provided. It dynamically calculates whether the year should be considered as part of the 20th or 21st century based on the current year, adhering to the guidelines set forth in RFC7231.
