            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find where the error message for invalid `DurationField` inputs is defined and possibly where the help text for `DurationField` is set or could be set. Since the issue mentions that this is a problem in Django's `DurationField`, we'll focus on finding the relevant parts of the Django codebase that handle the error message and help text for `DurationField`.\n\n1. **Search for the `DurationField` class**: This will help us find the file and class definition where `DurationField` is implemented. We can then look into this class to find where the error message and help text are defined or could be modified.\n\n2. **Search for methods related to validation in the `DurationField` class**: Since the issue is about an incorrect error message format, it's likely related to a validation method within the `DurationField` class. We need to find this method to see how the error message is generated.\n\n3. **Search for any method or property that sets `help_text` in `DurationField`**: This will help us understand where and how the help text is set for `DurationField`, allowing us to propose adding a default help text with the correct format.\n\nBased on these steps, the API calls would be:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DurationField\")`\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DurationField\")` - Assuming \"clean\" might be a common method name used for validation in Django fields.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"help_text\", \"DurationField\")` - This is a bit speculative; if \"help_text\" is not a method, it might be a property, but searching this way could give us a lead."
