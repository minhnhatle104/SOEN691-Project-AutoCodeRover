Given the complexity of the issue and without a specific pinpoint of the bug's location, a hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that the simplification process correctly handles expressions involving symbols with assumptions, especially when dealing with exponentiation. Since the issue seems to involve the handling of negative bases raised to arbitrary powers, a potential patch might involve adjusting the `simplify` method to better account for these cases. However, please note that without a deep dive into debugging and testing, this patch is speculative and would need thorough validation.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>expr = bottom_up(expr, lambda w: w.normal())
expr = Mul(*powsimp(expr).as_content_primitive())</original>
<patched>from sympy.core.power import Pow
from sympy.core.mul import Mul
from sympy.core.symbol import Symbol
from sympy.core.numbers import Integer

def custom_normalizer(w):
    if isinstance(w, Pow) and isinstance(w.base, Mul):
        if any(isinstance(t, Symbol) and t.is_negative for t in w.base.args):
            return Pow(Mul(*[t for t in w.base.args if not (isinstance(t, Symbol) and t.is_negative)]), w.exp, evaluate=False) * Pow(Integer(-1), w.exp, evaluate=False)
    return w.normal()

expr = bottom_up(expr, custom_normalizer)
expr = Mul(*powsimp(expr).as_content_primitive())</patched>
```

This modification introduces a `custom_normalizer` function in the `simplify` method to handle cases where the base of a power (`Pow`) expression is a multiplication (`Mul`) involving negative symbols. It separates the negative symbol and raises it to the power separately, multiplying it by the rest of the base raised to the power. This approach aims to address the inconsistency in simplification by explicitly handling negative symbols in bases.

Please note, this patch is a starting point and might not cover all edge cases. It's essential to conduct comprehensive testing, including regression tests, to ensure that this change does not introduce new issues. Further adjustments might be necessary based on a deeper understanding of the problem and additional testing results.
