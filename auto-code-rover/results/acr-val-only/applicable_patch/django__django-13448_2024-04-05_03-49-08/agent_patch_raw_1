<original>if serialize:
    self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()</original>
<patched>if serialize and self.connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('MIGRATE', True):
    self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()

```

These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that when migrations are skipped (`"MIGRATE": False`), essential system tables like `django_admin_log` are still created by faking the initial migration for the `admin` app if it is installed. Additionally, the serialization process is conditionally skipped to prevent errors related to missing tables when migrations are not run. This approach allows the use of the `"MIGRATE": False` setting without crashing the test runner due to missing tables.
