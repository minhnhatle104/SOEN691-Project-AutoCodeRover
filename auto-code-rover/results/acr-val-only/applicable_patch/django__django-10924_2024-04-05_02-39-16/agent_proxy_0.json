            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how `FilePathField` is implemented and how it currently handles the `path` argument. Since the issue revolves around allowing `FilePathField`'s `path` to accept a callable, we should look into the `FilePathField` class and any relevant methods that deal with the `path` attribute. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"FilePathField\")`: This will help us understand the current implementation of `FilePathField` and how it handles the `path` attribute.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"deconstruct\", \"FilePathField\")`: Since the issue mentions a problem with migrations (`manage.py makemigrations`), looking into the `deconstruct` method of `FilePathField` might provide insights into how the field's attributes are serialized for migrations.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"FilePathField\")`: Understanding the initialization of `FilePathField` can give us clues on how the `path` attribute is currently processed and how we might modify it to accept a callable."
