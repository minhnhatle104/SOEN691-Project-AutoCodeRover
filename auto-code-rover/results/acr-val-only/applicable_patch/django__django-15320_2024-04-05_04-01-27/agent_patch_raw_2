Given the feedback, it appears the initial approach to directly modify the `subquery_sql` handling in the `as_sql` method might not have been fully compatible with all use cases, leading to test failures. A more cautious approach is needed, particularly to ensure compatibility with existing functionalities and to address the core issue without introducing regressions. Let's revise the patch with a focus on minimizing potential side effects.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>    def __init__(self, queryset, output_field=None, **extra):
        # Allow the usage of both QuerySet and sql.Query objects.
        self.query = getattr(queryset, 'query', queryset)
        self.extra = extra
        super().__init__(output_field)
</original>
<patched>    def __init__(self, queryset, output_field=None, **extra):
        # Allow the usage of both QuerySet and sql.Query objects.
        self.query = getattr(queryset, 'query', queryset)
        self.query.subquery = True  # Ensure the query is marked as a subquery
        self.extra = extra
        super().__init__(output_field)
</patched>
```

Given the test failures, it seems the approach to modify the `as_sql` method might have been too aggressive or not accounted for all scenarios. However, setting the `subquery` attribute in the `__init__` method remains a valid and necessary fix to ensure the `query` object is correctly identified as a subquery. This change should not impact existing functionalities negatively but ensures that the `query` object's `subquery` attribute is appropriately set, addressing part of the issue described.

For the `as_sql` method, a more refined approach is needed. Given the feedback, it's crucial to maintain the original behavior as much as possible while still addressing the issue of incorrect SQL generation. The revised patch will focus on ensuring that modifications to the `as_sql` method do not inadvertently affect other functionalities or use cases.

# modification 2 (Revised Approach)
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection, template=None, query=None, **extra_context):
        connection.ops.check_expression_support(self)
        template_params = {**self.extra, **extra_context}
        query = query or self.query
        subquery_sql, sql_params = query.as_sql(compiler, connection)
        template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql[1:-1]

        template = template or template_params.get('template', self.template)
        sql = template % template_params
        return sql, sql_params
</original>
<patched>    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection, template=None, query=None, **extra_context):
        connection.ops.check_expression_support(self)
        template_params = {**self.extra, **extra_context}
        query = query or self.query
        subquery_sql, sql_params = query.as_sql(compiler, connection)
        # Adjusted to ensure proper handling of subquery_sql boundaries
        if subquery_sql.startswith('(') and subquery_sql.endswith(')'):
            template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql  # Use as is, without trimming
        else:
            template_params['subquery'] = '(' + subquery_sql + ')'  # Enclose in parentheses to ensure correctness

        template = template or template_params.get('template', self.template)
        sql = template % template_params
        return sql, sql_params
</patched>
```

This revised approach for the `as_sql` method ensures that the SQL string is correctly handled, whether or not it is already enclosed in parentheses, thus addressing the core issue without removing necessary characters from the SQL string. This change aims to fix the issue while minimizing the risk of introducing new problems or failing existing tests.
