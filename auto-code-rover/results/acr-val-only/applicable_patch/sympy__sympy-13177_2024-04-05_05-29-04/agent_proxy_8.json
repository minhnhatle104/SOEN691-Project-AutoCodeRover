Since my previous responses did not align with the task's requirements and considering the constraints, let me correct my approach:\n\n- **do we need more context:** Yes\n\nGiven the information from the search results and the issue at hand, a more targeted approach to understand the implementation details within the `sympy/core/mod.py` file is necessary. Therefore, I propose the following search API call to directly investigate the implementation of the modulo operation within that file:\n\n- search_code_in_file(\"def Mod\", \"sympy/core/mod.py\")\n\nThis search is intended to locate the definition of the `Mod` function or method within the specified file, which is likely where the issue's logic needs to be corrected."
