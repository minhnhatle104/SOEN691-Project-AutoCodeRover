Given the constraints and the fact that the initial approach to introduce a new method (`are_equivalent_dims`) in the `DimensionSystem` class did not resolve the issue as expected, let's consider an alternative approach that directly addresses the comparison of dimensions within the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method itself. This approach will focus on enhancing the dimension comparison logic to recognize equivalent dimensions without necessarily introducing new methods or significantly altering the structure of the existing classes.

                base_dim = self.get_dimension_system().get_dimensional_dependencies(dim)
                base_addend_dim = self.get_dimension_system().get_dimensional_dependencies(addend_dim)
                if base_dim != base_addend_dim:
                    raise ValueError(
                        'Dimension of "{}" is {}, '
                        'but it should be equivalent to {}'.format(
                            addend, addend_dim, dim))

Explanation:
This patch modifies the dimension comparison logic in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to first convert dimensions to their base units before comparing them. This is achieved by using the `get_dimensional_dependencies` method of the `DimensionSystem` class, which returns a dictionary representing the dimensional dependencies (i.e., the base units and their powers) of a given dimension. By comparing these dimensional dependencies instead of the dimensions directly, the method can recognize equivalent dimensions (e.g., `velocity` and `length/time`, or `acceleration*time` and `length/time`) as being the same, thus allowing the addition of quantities with equivalent dimensions without raising an error.

This approach does not require the introduction of new methods to the `DimensionSystem` class and works within the existing framework of dimension handling in SymPy's units system. It directly addresses the issue by ensuring that the comparison of dimensions accounts for their physical equivalence based on their representation in terms of base units.

Note: This solution assumes that the `get_dimensional_dependencies` method accurately reflects the base unit composition of dimensions, which is a reasonable assumption given the method's intended purpose in the SymPy units system.
