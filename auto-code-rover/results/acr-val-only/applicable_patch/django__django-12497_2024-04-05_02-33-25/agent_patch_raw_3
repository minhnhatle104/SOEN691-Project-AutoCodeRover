```

This patch corrects the hint in the `_check_relationship_model` method by replacing the incorrect advice to use `ForeignKey` with the correct `ManyToManyField` for creating recursive relationships. Additionally, it removes the mention of `symmetrical=False`, which is not applicable to `ManyToManyField` and aligns the hint with the current Django API expectations for defining such relationships.
