```

This patch corrects the hint provided in the error messages for ambiguous foreign key relationships in intermediary models of a many-to-many field. It replaces the incorrect suggestion to use `ForeignKey` with the correct `ManyToManyField` and removes the outdated `symmetrical=False` argument, aligning the hint with the current Django requirements for defining recursive relationships through an intermediary model.
