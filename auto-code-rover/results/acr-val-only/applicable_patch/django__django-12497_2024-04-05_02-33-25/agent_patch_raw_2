hint=(
    'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
    'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'

    relationship_model_name,
),
</original>
<patched>
hint=(
    'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
    'use ManyToManyField("%s", through="%s").'
) % (
    RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
    relationship_model_name,
),
</patched>
```

This modification corrects the guidance provided in the error messages when there's ambiguity in the foreign keys of an intermediary model for a many-to-many field. It updates the hint to correctly suggest using `ManyToManyField` instead of `ForeignKey`, and removes the incorrect and outdated `symmetrical=False` argument, ensuring the advice aligns with the current Django API for defining recursive relationships with an intermediary model.
