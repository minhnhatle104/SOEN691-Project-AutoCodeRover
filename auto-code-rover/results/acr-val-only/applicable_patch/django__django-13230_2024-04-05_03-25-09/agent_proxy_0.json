Based on the issue description, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `add_item` method in the `syndication.views` file**: This will help us understand the current implementation of the method and how we can modify it to include the `comments` argument.\n   \n   `search_method_in_file(\"add_item\", \"syndication.views\")`\n\n2. **Search for any existing implementation or mention of `item_comments`**: Since the issue mentions adding support for `item_comments`, it's important to see if there are any existing references or partial implementations in the codebase.\n   \n   `search_code(\"item_comments\")`\n\n3. **Search for the usage of `item_extra_kwargs`**: Understanding how `item_extra_kwargs` is currently used in relation to adding items might give us insights into how to best introduce the `comments` argument without disrupting existing functionality.\n   \n   `search_code(\"item_extra_kwargs\")`\n\n4. **Search for any mention of `comments` in the context of feedparser**: Since the issue description mentions that `comments` is explicitly mentioned in the feedparser but not implemented in the view, it would be helpful to understand its current context or planned usage.\n   \n   `search_code(\"comments\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of how items are currently added to feeds, how comments are intended to be handled, and where modifications are needed to implement the requested feature."
