Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial speculative patch did not resolve the issue, let's consider a different approach to address the problem with setting `LogNorm` after the colorbar has been created in Matplotlib 3.6.3. This revised approach will focus on ensuring that the colorbar and associated mappable object can dynamically update their normalization without causing an "Invalid vmin or vmax" error.

Since the initial attempt did not yield the desired outcome and without direct access to test results or specific failure points, this next attempt will be more conceptual, aiming to address potential root causes based on the described behavior and common practices in handling dynamic updates to objects in Python.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/colors.py</file>
<original>
def __call__(self, value, clip=None):
    # Existing LogNorm value processing logic
</original>
<patched>
def __call__(self, value, clip=None):
    if self.vmin <= 0 or self.vmax <= 0:
        raise ValueError("LogNorm requires vmin and vmax to be positive")
    # Proceed with the existing value processing logic
</patched>
```
This modification ensures that `LogNorm` explicitly checks `vmin` and `vmax` values each time it processes data, providing a clearer error message if the values are not set correctly.

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/cm.py</file>
<original>
x = self.norm(x)
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure normalization is attempted only with valid vmin and vmax for LogNorm
if isinstance(self.norm, LogNorm) and (self.norm.vmin is not None and self.norm.vmax is not None):
    x = self.norm(x)
else:
    raise ValueError("Invalid vmin or vmax for LogNorm normalization")
</patched>
```
This modification adds a conditional check around the normalization step to ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are valid before attempting to apply `LogNorm`. This aims to prevent the normalization step from proceeding with invalid values.

# modification 3
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py</file>
<original>
plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin, vmax)
plot.autoscale()
</original>
<patched>
# Dynamically update the norm and ensure the colorbar reflects the change
plot.set_norm(LogNorm(vmin, vmax))
plot.autoscale()
if hasattr(plot, 'colorbar'):
    plot.colorbar.update_normal(plot)
</patched>
```
This modification suggests using a hypothetical `set_norm` method (assuming one exists or could be implemented) for a more controlled update of the norm. It also proposes directly updating the colorbar, if associated with the plot, to reflect the change in normalization.

These modifications are conceptual and aim to address potential issues based on the description of the problem. Implementing and testing these changes would require access to the Matplotlib codebase and a thorough understanding of its architecture and design patterns. Further, since these patches are speculative, they should be validated against the Matplotlib test suite to ensure they do not introduce regressions or new issues.
