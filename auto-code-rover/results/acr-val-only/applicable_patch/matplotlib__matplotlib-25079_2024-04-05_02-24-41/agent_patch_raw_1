Given the context of the issue with Matplotlib 3.6.3 where setting the norm to `LogNorm` after the colorbar has been created fails with an `Invalid vmin` value, and based on the traceback and analysis provided, I'll propose a hypothetical patch. This patch is speculative and aims to address potential areas in the code that could be causing the issue, specifically focusing on the handling of `vmin` and `vmax` in the context of `LogNorm` and the colorbar update process.

Please note, without direct access to the Matplotlib codebase at the specific version and without running tests, this patch is an educated guess intended to illustrate how one might approach resolving the described issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/colors.py</file>
<original>
class LogNorm(Normalize):
    def __init__(self, vmin=None, vmax=None, clip=False):
        Normalize.__init__(self, vmin, vmax, clip)
</original>
<patched>
class LogNorm(Normalize):
    def __init__(self, vmin=None, vmax=None, clip=False):
        if vmin <= 0:
            raise ValueError("vmin must be positive for LogNorm")
        Normalize.__init__(self, vmin, vmax, clip)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/cm.py</file>
<original>
if norm:
    x = self.norm(x)
rgba = self.cmap(x, alpha=alpha, bytes=bytes)
</original>
<patched>
if norm:
    try:
        x = self.norm(x)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error applying norm: {e}") from e
rgba = self.cmap(x, alpha=alpha, bytes=bytes)
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py</file>
<original>
def update_normal(self, mappable):
    """
    Update the colorbar to match the mappable's norm and colormap.
    """
    self.mappable = mappable
    self.draw_all()
</original>
<patched>
def update_normal(self, mappable):
    """
    Update the colorbar to match the mappable's norm and colormap.
    Ensure vmin and vmax are valid for LogNorm.
    """
    if isinstance(mappable.norm, LogNorm) and (mappable.norm.vmin <= 0 or mappable.norm.vmax <= 0):
        raise ValueError("vmin and vmax must be positive for LogNorm")
    self.mappable = mappable
    self.draw_all()
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are handled correctly when using `LogNorm`, provide clearer error messaging, and prevent the application of `LogNorm` with invalid `vmin` or `vmax` values. Testing these changes thoroughly in the context of the Matplotlib codebase would be essential to validate their effectiveness and ensure they do not introduce other issues.
