Given the constraints and the failure of the initial patch, let's reconsider the approach focusing on the core issue: `lambdify` struggles with `MatrixSymbol` names that include characters not valid in Python variable names, even with `dummify=True`. The problem likely lies in how these symbols are handled and converted into function arguments or variables within the generated lambda function. Since the initial attempt to sanitize names directly in the namespace and argument list did not resolve the issue, a more targeted approach might be necessary, especially focusing on the dummification process and how `MatrixSymbol` names are treated.

Given the limitations in directly modifying the code and the absence of specific methods like `_EvaluatorPrinter` or `_TensorflowEvaluatorPrinter` in the search results, a hypothetical patch would aim to ensure that during the dummification process, all symbols, including those with special characters, are appropriately handled. This could involve a more robust handling mechanism for symbol names during the conversion to the namespace and the generation of the lambda function code.

However, without the ability to directly test or verify the impact of changes in the codebase, and considering the initial patch did not resolve the issue, the best course of action would be to closely review the `lambdify` function's handling of `MatrixSymbol` names and dummification. This would involve:

1. Ensuring that during dummification, all symbols are converted to valid Python identifiers, possibly by introducing a more sophisticated naming scheme or mapping mechanism for symbols to dummy variables.
2. Reviewing how these dummy variables are then incorporated into the generated lambda function, ensuring that the mapping from original symbol names to dummy names is maintained and correctly applied throughout the code generation process.

Given these considerations, a more detailed examination and debugging of the `lambdify` function's implementation are required to identify the precise cause of the issue and to develop an effective patch. This would likely involve collaboration with other developers familiar with the `lambdify` function's intricacies and the broader SymPy codebase.
