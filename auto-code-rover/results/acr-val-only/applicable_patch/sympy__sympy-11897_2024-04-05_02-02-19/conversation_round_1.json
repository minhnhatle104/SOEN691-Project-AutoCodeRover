        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we can start analyzing the context around the issue of inconsistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers in the project.\n\n1. **LaTeX Printer Implementation**:\n   - The `latex` function is defined in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. This function converts a given expression to its LaTeX representation. It supports a wide range of settings to customize the output, such as `mode`, `fold_frac_powers`, `fold_func_brackets`, `fold_short_frac`, `long_frac_ratio`, `mul_symbol`, `inv_trig_style`, `mat_str`, `mat_delim`, and `symbol_names`.\n   - The `latex` function uses the `LatexPrinter` class to generate the LaTeX code. The settings passed to the `latex` function are used to configure the `LatexPrinter` instance.\n\n2. **Pretty Printer Implementation**:\n   - The search for the `pprint` method did not yield any results in the codebase. This might indicate that the pretty printer is either implemented under a different name or is part of a larger module that wasn't directly identified through the search query.\n\n3. **Expression Handling**:\n   - The expression `exp(-x)*log(x)` is found in a test case within `sympy/integrals/tests/test_integrals.py`, indicating that this expression is used in the context of integration tests. However, this does not provide direct insight into how the pretty printer or LaTeX printer handles this expression specifically.\n   - The expression `1/(x + y)/2` is found in a test case within `sympy/printing/tests/test_latex.py`, specifically testing the LaTeX output. The expected LaTeX output for this expression is `\"\\frac{1}{2 \\left(x + y\\right)}\"`. This gives us a clear example of how the LaTeX printer is expected to handle such expressions.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The inconsistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers as described in the issue might stem from differences in how these printers are implemented and configured. Given that the pretty printer's implementation details are not directly available, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation.\n- The LaTeX printer's behavior is highly customizable through various settings, which could potentially lead to differences in output if not configured to match the pretty printer's defaults or expected behavior.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Investigate the implementation of the pretty printer to understand its default behavior and settings.\n- Review the configuration and default settings used in both the LaTeX and pretty printer implementations to identify any discrepancies.\n- Consider creating a unified configuration or set of rules that both printers can follow to ensure consistency, taking into account the specific cases mentioned in the issue (`exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`).\n\nGiven the current information, these steps would be necessary to develop a patch or series of patches to address the inconsistency issue."
