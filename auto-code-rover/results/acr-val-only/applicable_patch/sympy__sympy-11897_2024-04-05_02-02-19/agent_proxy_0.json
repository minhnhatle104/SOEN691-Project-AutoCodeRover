The issue mentions inconsistencies between the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer in handling expressions like `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. To get started, let's gather more context about the implementation of these printers and the relevant expressions handling.\n\nWe will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"latex\")`: This will help us find where and how the LaTeX printer is implemented.\n2. `search_method(\"pprint\")`: This will help us find where and how the pretty printer is implemented.\n3. `search_code(\"exp(-x)*log(x)\")`: This will help us understand how the expression `exp(-x)*log(x)` is being processed.\n4. `search_code(\"1/(x + y)/2\")`: This will help us understand how the expression `1/(x + y)/2` is being processed."
