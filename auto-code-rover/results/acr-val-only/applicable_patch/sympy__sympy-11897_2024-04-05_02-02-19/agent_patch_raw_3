Given the constraints and the nature of the task, I understand that a direct code patch is expected. However, without the ability to test changes or access the full project codebase, providing a specific and accurate code patch is challenging. My previous responses aimed to offer a conceptual approach to address the issue based on the information provided.

Since a direct code modification is required and considering the limitations, I'll attempt to provide a hypothetical patch based on the initial analysis. This patch aims to address the inconsistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers by ensuring that both handle expressions in a similar manner, specifically for the cases mentioned in the issue. Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase correctly.

# Hypothetical Patch

```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>def _print_Add(self, expr, order=None):
    ...
    for i, term in enumerate(terms):
        if i == 0:
            pass
        elif _coeff_isneg(term):
            tex += " - "
            term = -term
        else:
            tex += " + "
        term_tex = self._print(term)
        if self._needs_add_brackets(term):
            term_tex = r"\left(%s\right)" % term_tex
        tex += term_tex
    ...
</original>
<patched>def _print_Add(self, expr, order=None):
    ...
    for i, term in enumerate(terms):
        if i == 0:
            pass
        elif _coeff_isneg(term):
            tex += " - "
            term = -term
        else:
            if i > 0:
                tex += " + "
        term_tex = self._print(term)
        # Ensure consistency in handling fractions and function brackets
        if self._needs_add_brackets(term) or isinstance(term, (Mul, Pow)):
            term_tex = r"\left(%s\right)" % term_tex
        tex += term_tex
    ...
</patched>
```

Please note, this patch is hypothetical and aims to illustrate how one might begin to address the inconsistency issue by modifying the `_print_Add` method in the LaTeX printer to ensure it handles expressions similarly to the pretty printer. The specific change here is to ensure that terms which are instances of `Mul` or `Pow` are also enclosed in brackets, similar to how fractions and certain functions might be handled. This is based on the assumption that such a change could bring the LaTeX printer's output closer to that of the pretty printer for the given examples.

This patch is intended as a starting point and may require further refinement or testing to ensure it correctly addresses the issue without introducing new problems.
