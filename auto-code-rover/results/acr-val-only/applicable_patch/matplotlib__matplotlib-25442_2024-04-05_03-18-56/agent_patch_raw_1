Based on the analysis and the provided context, the issue seems to stem from the handling of the `canvas` attribute, particularly in scenarios where it might become `None` due to the interaction between `mplcursor` and `matplotlib`. The `DraggableBase` class and its methods (`on_pick`, `on_motion`, `on_release`, and `disconnect`) are directly involved in handling mouse events and updating the state based on those events. The error occurs because the `canvas` attribute is accessed without checking if it's `None`.

To address this issue, we can introduce checks to ensure that the `canvas` attribute is not `None` before attempting to access it. This approach aims to prevent the `AttributeError` from being raised. Below are the proposed modifications:

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self._c1)</original>
<patched>if self.canvas is not None:
    self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self._c1)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)</original>
<patched>if self.canvas is not None:
    self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>self.canvas.restore_region(self.background)
self.ref_artist.draw(
    self.ref_artist.figure._get_renderer())
self.canvas.blit()</original>
<patched>if self.canvas is not None:
    self.canvas.restore_region(self.background)
    self.ref_artist.draw(
        self.ref_artist.figure._get_renderer())
    self.canvas.blit()</patched>
```

# modification 4
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>self.canvas.draw()</original>
<patched>if self.canvas is not None:
    self.canvas.draw()</patched>
```

These modifications introduce a simple check to ensure that operations involving the `canvas` are only attempted if `canvas` is not `None`. This should help to avoid the `AttributeError` when `mplcursor` and `matplotlib` are used together, especially after clicking a few data points as described in the issue. It's important to note that while these patches can prevent the error from occurring, further investigation might be necessary to understand the underlying cause of why `canvas` becomes `None` in these scenarios, which might involve deeper integration aspects between `mplcursor` and `matplotlib`.
