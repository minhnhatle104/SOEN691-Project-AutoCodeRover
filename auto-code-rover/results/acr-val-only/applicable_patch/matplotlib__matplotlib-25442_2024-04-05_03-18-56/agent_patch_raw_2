Given that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests failed, it suggests that the approach of simply guarding against `None` may not address the root cause or might be too simplistic. The issue might be more about the lifecycle of the `canvas` and its relationship with the `ref_artist` and the figure, especially in the context of interactions that `mplcursor` facilitates.

A more nuanced approach could involve ensuring that the `ref_artist` and its associated `figure` and `canvas` are correctly managed throughout the event handling lifecycle. This might include more robust checks and handling around the lifecycle events of the `canvas` and `ref_artist`. However, without the ability to modify the `mplcursor` code directly or more detailed insights into its interactions with `matplotlib`, we're somewhat limited in our approach.

Given the constraints, let's propose a more defensive programming approach within the `matplotlib` codebase to ensure that event handlers are more resilient to the state where the `ref_artist`'s figure might become `None`. This involves not just checking for `None` but also ensuring that event handlers gracefully handle the disconnection or reconnection scenarios.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>if self._check_still_parented() and self.got_artist:</original>
<patched>if self.canvas and self._check_still_parented() and self.got_artist:</patched>
```

This modification ensures that before proceeding with any logic that assumes the presence of a `canvas`, we explicitly check that `self.canvas` is not `None`. This is a more direct approach to ensure that the methods involved in event handling do not proceed when the `canvas` is `None`.

# modification 2 (Revised)
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>if self._use_blit:
    self.canvas.restore_region(self.background)
    self.ref_artist.draw(
        self.ref_artist.figure._get_renderer())
    self.canvas.blit()</original>
<patched>if self._use_blit and self.canvas:
    if self.background is not None:
        self.canvas.restore_region(self.background)
    if self.ref_artist.figure:
        self.ref_artist.draw(
            self.ref_artist.figure._get_renderer())
        self.canvas.blit()</patched>
```

This modification adds additional checks to ensure that `self.background` and `self.ref_artist.figure` are not `None` before attempting operations that depend on them. This should help to prevent errors in scenarios where the figure or background has been unset or changed due to interactions.

# modification 3 (Revised)
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>self.canvas.draw()</original>
<patched>if self.canvas is not None:
    self.canvas.draw()</patched>
```

This modification remains largely the same as initially proposed, ensuring that `self.canvas.draw()` is only called when `self.canvas` is not `None`.

These revised modifications aim to address the issue more holistically by considering the state of `self.canvas`, `self.background`, and `self.ref_artist.figure` in the context of event handling. This approach should make the event handling code more resilient to changes in the state that might be induced by interactions through `mplcursor`. However, it's important to note that further testing and validation would be necessary to ensure that these changes effectively resolve the issue without introducing new problems.
