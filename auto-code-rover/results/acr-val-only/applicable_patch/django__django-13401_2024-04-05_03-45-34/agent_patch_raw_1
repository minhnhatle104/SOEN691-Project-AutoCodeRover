# modification 3
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>    def __lt__(self, other):
        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter
        return NotImplemented
</original>
<patched>    def __lt__(self, other):
        # Adjusted to order by model first if creation_counters are equal
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            if self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter:
                return self.model < other.model
            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter
        return NotImplemented
</patched>
```

**Note**: The modifications assume that `self.model` and `other.model` can be directly compared and hashed, which is true if they are represented by strings or class objects with properly defined `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods. If `model` is not directly available on the `Field` instance, or if it does not support direct comparison or hashing, additional logic may be needed to retrieve and compare model identifiers appropriately.
