Given the feedback, it appears the initial approach might not have fully considered the context in which model fields operate, especially considering that the `model` attribute might not always be directly comparable or hashable in the way the patch assumed. Additionally, the `model` attribute might not be set at the time these methods are called. Let's revise the approach to ensure compatibility and address the issue without introducing test failures.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>    def __eq__(self, other):
        # Needed for @total_ordering
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            return self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter
        return NotImplemented
</original>
<patched>    def __eq__(self, other):
        # Adjusted to include model comparison for equality
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            same_model = self.model == other.model if self.model and other.model else True
            return (self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter) and same_model
        return NotImplemented
</patched>
```

# modification 2 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.creation_counter)
</original>
<patched>    def __hash__(self):
        # Adjust hash to consider the model's label (as a proxy for the model itself) if available
        model_label = self.model._meta.label_lower if self.model else 'no-model'
        return hash((self.creation_counter, model_label))
</patched>
```

# modification 3 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>    def __lt__(self, other):
        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter
        return NotImplemented
</original>
<patched>    def __lt__(self, other):
        # Adjusted to consider model label for ordering if creation counters are equal
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            if self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter:
                self_model_label = self.model._meta.label_lower if self.model else ''
                other_model_label = other.model._meta.label_lower if other.model else ''
                return self_model_label < other_model_label
            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter
        return NotImplemented
</patched>
```

**Note**: This revised approach uses the model's `_meta.label_lower` as a proxy for comparing models. This attribute is generally available and provides a consistent way to identify and compare models. The modifications also account for cases where the `model` attribute might not be set (`self.model and other.model else True` in `__eq__` and using `'no-model'` or `''` as defaults in `__hash__` and `__lt__` respectively). This should ensure that the fields are correctly compared, hashed, and ordered without causing test failures due to unhandled cases.
