            "content": "Given the clarification, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the request for additional search API calls. Since the initial analysis didn't directly point to a specific method or interaction that could be causing the issue beyond those already identified, and without further specific leads to follow, I suggested a deeper investigation into the already identified components rather than additional search API calls.\n\nHowever, if we were to refine our approach and seek more detailed context within the scope of the provided API capabilities, we might consider looking more closely at the implementation details of the `pretty_print` function, as well as the `_sympystr` methods of `CoordSys3D` and `Del`. Since the API doesn't support directly querying the content or implementation of these methods, and my previous response assumed a broader investigation beyond the immediate API capabilities, no specific additional search API calls were formulated.\n\nTo adhere strictly to the instructions and considering the limitations, here's a revised approach that remains within the provided capabilities, although it might not yield further insights without direct access to method implementations:\n\n- **Further Context Needed**: At this point, based on the information provided and the capabilities described, there does not seem to be a direct path to gather more context using the search API calls without more specific leads or questions about the implementation. The issue likely involves a deeper dive into the implementation of `pretty_print`, as well as how it interacts with the string representations provided by `_sympystr` methods in `CoordSys3D` and `Del`.\n\n- **Bug Locations**:\n  - **File**: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, **Method**: `pretty_print`\n  - **File**: `sympy/vector/coordsysrect.py`, **Method**: `_sympystr` (within `CoordSys3D`)\n  - **File**: `sympy/vector/deloperator.py`, **Method**: `_sympystr` (within `Del`)\n\nThese locations are identified based on the analysis of the issue description and the search results provided, suggesting that the interaction between these components and their representations is at the heart of the issue. Without specific errors or further details on the bug's manifestation beyond what's described, pinpointing the exact line or condition causing the issue would require access to the codebase for a detailed review."
