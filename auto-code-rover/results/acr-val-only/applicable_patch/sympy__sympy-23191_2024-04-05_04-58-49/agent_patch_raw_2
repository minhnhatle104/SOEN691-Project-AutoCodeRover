Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct and specific patch to resolve the issue cannot be accurately determined without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of the `pretty` function and how it interacts with vector expressions and integrals. The initial approach aimed to conceptually address potential areas of improvement without direct insight into the root cause of the issue, which is insufficient for resolving the specific problem described.

Without access to the full implementation details of the `pretty` function and without specific error messages or failed test cases to guide the debugging process, providing a precise and effective patch is challenging. The issue likely involves intricate details of the pretty printing logic that are not evident from the provided snippets and descriptions alone.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Debugging and Testing**: Running the provided code snippet in various environments and configurations to reproduce the issue consistently. This would also involve adding debug statements within the `pretty` function and related methods to trace how the expression is processed and where the formatting might be going awry.

2. **Reviewing Related Documentation and Source Code**: Examining the SymPy documentation and source code in detail, especially the parts related to pretty printing, vector expressions, and integral handling. This could reveal known limitations, bugs, or specific behaviors that could lead to the observed issue.

3. **Engaging with the Community**: If the issue remains unresolved, engaging with the SymPy community through forums, issue trackers, or mailing lists could provide additional insights. Other users or developers might have encountered similar issues or could offer guidance on navigating the pretty printing logic.

Given these limitations, a more detailed and targeted investigation is required to identify and implement an effective patch. This process underscores the importance of thorough testing, access to comprehensive documentation, and sometimes community engagement in resolving complex software development issues.
