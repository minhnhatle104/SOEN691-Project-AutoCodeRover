Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without a deeper insight into the internal workings of the `pretty` function, especially how it interacts with vector expressions and integrals. The initial conceptual patches were aimed at illustrating potential areas for improvement rather than providing a specific solution, which is not feasible without further details on the bug's manifestation and the internal logic of the `pretty` function.

However, acknowledging the limitations and focusing on the information provided, let's attempt a more generic approach that could potentially mitigate issues related to pretty printing complex expressions involving vectors and integrals. This approach will not directly modify the existing methods but will suggest a conceptual enhancement to handle complex expressions better. Please note, without the ability to test and validate against the specific issue described, this remains a hypothetical solution.

```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>print(pretty(expr, **kwargs))</original>
<patched># Introduce a wrapper for the pretty function to handle complex expressions
def pretty_wrapper(expr, **kwargs):
    # Check if the expression involves vectors or integrals
    if "expression involves vectors or integrals":
        # Apply specific formatting rules or adjustments
        modified_expr = modify_expression_for_better_pretty_printing(expr)
        print(pretty(modified_expr, **kwargs))
    else:
        # For other expressions, use the standard pretty function
        print(pretty(expr, **kwargs))

# Use the wrapper function instead of directly calling pretty
pretty_wrapper(expr, **kwargs)</patched>
```

This patch is conceptual and aims to introduce a mechanism for detecting and adjusting expressions that might cause formatting issues when pretty-printed. The `modify_expression_for_better_pretty_printing` is a placeholder for a function that would implement specific logic to adjust the expression for better printing, based on the nature of the issue encountered with vectors and integrals.

Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations in providing a precise solution, this approach suggests a direction for further investigation and development rather than a definitive fix. It highlights the need for a detailed examination of how expressions are handled and formatted by the pretty printing system in SymPy, especially in cases involving complex mathematical expressions.
