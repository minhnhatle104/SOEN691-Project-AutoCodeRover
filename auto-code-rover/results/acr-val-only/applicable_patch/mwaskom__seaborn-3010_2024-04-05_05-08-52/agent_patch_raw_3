I understand the need to correct the approach. Given the constraints and the feedback, let's revise the strategy for handling missing data in the `_fit_predict` method. The initial patch attempted to address the issue by filtering out `None` values directly, but it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the implementation details or how the data should be handled in conjunction with seaborn's expectations. Let's attempt a different approach that ensures compatibility and addresses the root cause more effectively.

<original>    def _fit_predict(self, data):

        x = data["x"]
        y = data["y"]
        if x.nunique() <= self.order:
            # TODO warn?
            xx = yy = []
        else:
            p = np.polyfit(x, y, self.order)
            xx = np.linspace(x.min(), x.max(), self.gridsize)
            yy = np.polyval(p, xx)

        return pd.DataFrame(dict(x=xx, y=yy))
</original>
<patched>    def _fit_predict(self, data):
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np

        x = data["x"]
        y = data["y"]
        # Filter out rows where either x or y is NaN (which could be the result of None values in the input)
        valid_data = pd.DataFrame({"x": x, "y": y}).dropna()
        x = valid_data["x"]
        y = valid_data["y"]

        if len(x) <= self.order or len(y) <= self.order:
            # If there are not enough valid data points after filtering, return empty arrays
            # This also addresses the case where x or y might be empty after filtering
            xx = yy = np.array([])
        else:
            # Proceed with polynomial fitting on cleaned data
            p = np.polyfit(x, y, self.order)
            xx = np.linspace(x.min(), x.max(), self.gridsize)
            yy = np.polyval(p, xx)

        return pd.DataFrame(dict(x=xx, y=yy))
</patched>
```

This revised patch focuses on creating a combined DataFrame from `x` and `y`, then dropping rows where either `x` or `y` is NaN, which effectively filters out invalid data points while maintaining the alignment between `x` and `y`. This approach ensures that `np.polyfit` is called with clean, aligned datasets, thereby avoiding the issue caused by `None` values. Additionally, it checks the length of `x` and `y` after filtering to ensure there are enough data points to perform the polynomial fit, addressing potential edge cases more robustly.
