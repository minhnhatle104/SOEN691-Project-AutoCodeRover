Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that my previous attempts to provide a patch were based on speculative implementations of the Knuth-Cohen bound, which were not successful. Without specific mathematical details or formulas for the Knuth-Cohen bound directly from the issue description or related academic sources, accurately implementing this bound is challenging.

However, since the direct implementation approach has led to test failures, and without concrete details on the Knuth-Cohen bound to correct the approach, I must clarify that without access to external resources or the ability to conduct further research, I cannot provide a corrected implementation of the Knuth-Cohen bound.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Mathematical Formula**: Directly consulting the mathematical literature or the research provided by Prof. Ag.Akritas and feedback from Mr. Kalevi Suominen to understand the exact formula and computational steps required for the Knuth-Cohen bound.

2. **Consulting with Domain Experts**: Collaborating with mathematicians or domain experts who have a deep understanding of polynomial bounds to ensure the accuracy of the implementation.

3. **Incremental Development and Testing**: Implementing the Knuth-Cohen bound in an incremental manner, closely monitoring the impact on existing tests, and possibly adding new tests to cover the scenarios highlighted by the research.

Given these limitations, I recommend seeking the exact mathematical definition and computational approach for the Knuth-Cohen bound from reliable mathematical sources or directly from the research mentioned in the issue description.
