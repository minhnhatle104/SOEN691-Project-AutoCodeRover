Note: The implementation of the Knuth-Cohen bound as described in the patched sections is based on a general understanding of the issue description. The actual formula for the Knuth-Cohen bound should be verified against authoritative mathematical sources or the original research mentioned in the issue. The use of `K.log(K(n + 1), 2)` is an interpretation of how the logarithm might be applied in this context, assuming `K` supports logarithmic operations.
