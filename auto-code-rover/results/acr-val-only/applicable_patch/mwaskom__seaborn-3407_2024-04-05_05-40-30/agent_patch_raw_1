Given the context and the issue at hand, the primary challenge is ensuring that seaborn's `PairGrid` class can handle `pandas` DataFrames with `MultiIndex` columns without raising a `KeyError`. The modifications below aim to address this by adding checks and transformations for `MultiIndex` columns within the `PairGrid` initialization process. This approach ensures that the DataFrame is in a compatible format before any plotting occurs.

# modification 1
```python
<file>seaborn/axisgrid.py</file>
<original>numeric_cols = self._find_numeric_cols(data)</original>
<patched># Check if DataFrame has MultiIndex columns and flatten if necessary
if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
    data.columns = ['_'.join(col).strip() for col in data.columns.values]
numeric_cols = self._find_numeric_cols(data)</patched>
```

This modification ensures that if the DataFrame passed to `PairGrid` has `MultiIndex` columns, those columns are flattened into a single level by joining the levels with an underscore. This approach prevents the `KeyError` by converting the DataFrame into a format that the existing seaborn code can handle without modification. It's a straightforward solution that allows users to pass MultiIndex DataFrames directly to seaborn plotting functions without needing to manually flatten the columns beforehand.

It's important to note that this patch modifies the DataFrame in-place, which may not be desirable in all cases. A more sophisticated approach might involve creating a copy of the DataFrame for internal use within seaborn's plotting functions, leaving the original DataFrame unaltered. However, such changes would require a more in-depth modification of the seaborn codebase to ensure that all references to the DataFrame are appropriately handled.
