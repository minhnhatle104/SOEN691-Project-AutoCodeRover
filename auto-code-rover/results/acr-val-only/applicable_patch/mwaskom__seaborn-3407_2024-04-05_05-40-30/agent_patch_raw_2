Given the complexity of the issue and the constraints of the environment, it appears that the initial patch might not fully address the problem or introduces a performance bottleneck. Let's consider an alternative approach that focuses on enhancing the compatibility of seaborn's plotting functions with `MultiIndex` DataFrames without altering the DataFrame itself. This approach involves adjusting how the `PairGrid` class handles column names internally, ensuring it can work with `MultiIndex` columns by converting them to a format it can process.

# modification 1
```python
<file>seaborn/axisgrid.py</file>
<original>if vars is not None:
    x_vars = list(vars)
    y_vars = list(vars)
if x_vars is None:
    x_vars = numeric_cols
if y_vars is None:
    y_vars = numeric_cols</original>
<patched># Convert MultiIndex columns to a flat format for internal processing
def _flatten_multiindex(index):
    if isinstance(index, pd.MultiIndex):
        return ['_'.join(map(str, col)).strip() for col in index.values]
    return index

if vars is not None:
    x_vars = _flatten_multiindex(list(vars))
    y_vars = _flatten_multiindex(list(vars))
if x_vars is None:
    x_vars = _flatten_multiindex(numeric_cols)
if y_vars is None:
    y_vars = _flatten_multiindex(numeric_cols)</patched>
```

This modification introduces a helper function `_flatten_multiindex` that is used to convert `MultiIndex` column names into a flattened format by joining the levels with an underscore. This conversion is applied to `x_vars` and `y_vars` within the `PairGrid` initialization, ensuring that the rest of the seaborn plotting logic can operate without modification. This approach maintains the original DataFrame structure without altering it, addressing the issue in a way that is transparent to the user.

The advantage of this approach is that it localizes the changes to the point where seaborn interacts with the DataFrame column names, minimizing the impact on the rest of the seaborn codebase. It also avoids potential performance issues related to modifying large DataFrames. However, it's important to note that this solution assumes that the column names resulting from flattening the `MultiIndex` are unique and meaningful, which may not always be the case. Further enhancements might involve more sophisticated handling of `MultiIndex` columns to preserve as much information as possible while ensuring compatibility with seaborn's plotting functions.
