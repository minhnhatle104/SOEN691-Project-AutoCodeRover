            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the classes and methods involved in the error. Specifically, we need to understand how `AxesGrid` and `GeoAxes` are implemented and how the `_tick_only` method functions, as these are directly mentioned in the bug report. Additionally, understanding the `axis` attribute's behavior in different contexts could be crucial. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `AxesGrid` class to understand its structure and initialization process:\n   - `search_class(\"AxesGrid\")`\n\n2. Search for the `GeoAxes` class to understand its specific implementations and how it differs from the default axes class:\n   - `search_class(\"GeoAxes\")`\n\n3. Since the error occurs in the `_tick_only` method, we need to understand how it's implemented and how it interacts with the `axis` attribute:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"_tick_only\", \"mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py\")`\n\n4. To understand the general behavior of the `axis` attribute across different axes classes, we should also look into how it's implemented in the `Axes` class, which is the base class for matplotlib axes:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"axis\", \"Axes\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the issue, allowing for a more informed approach to debugging and patching the bug."
