Given the feedback and the need to address the issue with a more accurate approach, let's refine the patch. The initial attempt aimed to uniformly handle the result format for models with zero deletions, but it seems there was a misunderstanding in the implementation details or the logic applied. Let's focus on ensuring that the `_rows_count` dictionary is consistently formatted, taking into account the structure of the `Collector` class and how it aggregates deletion counts.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>        deleted, _rows_count = collector.delete()

        # Clear the result cache, in case this QuerySet gets reused.
        self._result_cache = None
        return deleted, _rows_count</original>
<patched>        deleted, _rows_count = collector.delete()

        # Adjust the _rows_count to ensure consistency in the result format
        # when no objects are deleted, especially for models without foreign keys.
        if deleted == 0:
            all_models = {model._meta.label: 0 for model in collector.data.keys()}
            _rows_count.update(all_models)

        # Clear the result cache, in case this QuerySet gets reused.
        self._result_cache = None
        return deleted, _rows_count</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a different approach by leveraging the `collector.data` attribute, which holds information about the models involved in the deletion process. By iterating over `collector.data.keys()`, we can ensure that all models that were considered for deletion (even if no records were actually deleted) are represented in the `_rows_count` dictionary with a deletion count of zero. This approach should maintain consistency in the result format, addressing the issue without introducing discrepancies based on model relationships.
