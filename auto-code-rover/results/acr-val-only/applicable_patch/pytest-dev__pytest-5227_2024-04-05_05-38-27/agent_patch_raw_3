Given the constraints and the feedback, it appears that the initial approach to resolving the issue was correct in terms of updating the logging format to include the module name. However, since the application of the patch resulted in test failures, and without specific details on those failures, it's challenging to provide a revised patch that would address unknown issues.

The modifications provided were designed to update the default logging format to include the module name, as requested. These changes were directly related to the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable in `src/_pytest/logging.py` and the help messages for the `--log-format` and `--log-file-format` options to reflect the inclusion of the module name in the logging format.

Without further context or specific error messages from the failing tests, the best course of action would be to:

1. Review the failing tests to understand how the changes to the logging format are impacting them. This could reveal if the tests are dependent on the specific format of the logs.
2. Ensure that all parts of the system that parse or otherwise rely on the log format are updated to handle the new format correctly.
3. Consider whether the system or tests need to be updated to accommodate the change or if additional configuration options should be provided to allow for backward compatibility.

Since a more detailed patch cannot be provided without further information on the test failures, the original approach to modifying the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and updating the help messages for the relevant command-line options remains the best solution based on the information provided.
