        "content": "Based on the search result, the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is defined in the file `src/_pytest/logging.py`. This file likely handles the configuration and setup for logging within the pytest framework, given its name and the context of the code snippet provided. The current default logging format includes the filename, line number, log level, and the log message itself.\n\nThe issue suggests modifying this format to include the module name (`name`) and optionally the relative path, with a specific emphasis on making the module name part of the logging output. The proposed format is `\"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\"`, which adds the module name (`%(name)s`) before the filename and changes the order of the elements to start with the log level.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. **Understanding the Impact**: Before making changes, it's important to consider how this change might affect existing users of the library. Changing the default logging format could impact users who rely on the current format for log parsing or analysis tools. Therefore, it might be beneficial to provide this as an option rather than a replacement of the default.\n\n2. **Implementation**: The actual change seems straightforward\u2014modifying the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` string in `src/_pytest/logging.py` to the new format. However, care should be taken to ensure that the new elements (`%(name)s` and potentially the relative path) are supported in all logging contexts within pytest.\n\n3. **Testing and Documentation**: After implementation, thorough testing is necessary to ensure that the new format works as expected in various scenarios, including different logging levels and in different parts of the pytest framework. Additionally, updating the documentation to reflect this change and guide users on how to revert to the old format if needed would be important.\n\n4. **Optional Relative Path Handling**: The issue also mentions the possibility of including the relative path, with a suggestion to substitute `$VIRTUAL_ENV` for brevity. This would require additional logic to manipulate the file path before logging, which could be more complex to implement and test. It would be important to weigh the benefits of this additional information against the complexity it introduces.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to proceed with modifying the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in `src/_pytest/logging.py` according to the proposed format, while considering the broader impact of such a change."
