As I'm unable to directly interact with the codebase or run tests to identify why the previous patches did not resolve the issue or caused tests to fail, I'll propose a conceptual approach that should be more flexible and less likely to interfere with existing functionality or validations. This approach involves adding a mechanism to bypass or extend the validation for specific patterns without altering the core validation logic directly.

Given the constraints, a hypothetical solution could involve introducing a configuration option that allows users to specify additional option syntax patterns that should be accepted by the `handle_signature` method. This approach provides flexibility and maintains backward compatibility while addressing the issue.

                      '"/opt args" or "+opt args"'), potential_option,
                   location=signode)

<patched>
# Introduce a configurable list of additional valid option patterns.
# Users can extend this list in their Sphinx configuration to bypass the strict regex validation for specific patterns.
additional_option_patterns = sphinx.config.get('additional_option_patterns', [])
pattern_matched = any(re.match(pattern, potential_option) for pattern in additional_option_patterns)

m = option_desc_re.match(potential_option)
if not m and not pattern_matched:
    logger.warning(__('Malformed option description %r, should '
                      'look like "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", '
                      '"/opt args" or "+opt args", or match any user-defined patterns'), potential_option,
                   location=signode)
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a new configuration option `additional_option_patterns` that Sphinx users can define in their project's configuration file (`conf.py`). This list can include regular expressions for additional option syntax patterns that should be considered valid. The `handle_signature` method is then modified to check potential options against these user-defined patterns before proceeding with the existing strict regex validation. If a potential option matches any of the user-defined patterns, the strict validation is bypassed, preventing the warning for those cases.

This solution provides a flexible way to accommodate various option syntaxes without needing to modify the core validation logic directly for each special case. It also empowers users to tailor the validation to their specific needs, potentially reducing the need for further modifications to the Sphinx codebase.

Please note, this is a conceptual solution, and implementing it would require access to the Sphinx configuration mechanism (`sphinx.config`) and ensuring that `re.match` is appropriately imported and used. Additionally, thorough testing would be necessary to confirm that this approach effectively resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
