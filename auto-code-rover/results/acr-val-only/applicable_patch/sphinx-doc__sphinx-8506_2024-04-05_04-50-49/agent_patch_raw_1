To address the issue with Sphinx 3.2 complaining about the `option::` syntax that earlier versions accepted, we need to modify the regular expression (`option_desc_re`) used for matching option descriptions in the `handle_signature` method of the `Cmdoption` class. The goal is to make the regular expression more permissive to accommodate the `[enable=]PATTERN` syntax, as well as potentially other valid syntaxes that do not strictly conform to the previously expected patterns.

Given that the exact pattern of `option_desc_re` is not provided, I will assume a modification that aims to include an optional leading `[enable=]` part to the existing pattern. This is a hypothetical patch and should be tested and adjusted according to the actual regular expression and requirements.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/domains/std.py</file>
<original>
m = option_desc_re.match(potential_option)
if not m:
    logger.warning(__('Malformed option description %r, should '
                      'look like "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", '
                      '"/opt args" or "+opt args"'), potential_option,
                   location=signode)
</original>
<patched>
# Adjust the regular expression to allow an optional '[enable=]' prefix.
# This is a hypothetical example and the actual regex pattern needs to be adjusted accordingly.
option_desc_re = re.compile(r'(?:\[enable=\])?(?:opt|-opt\s+args|--opt\s+args|/opt\s+args|\+opt\s+args)')
m = option_desc_re.match(potential_option)
if not m:
    logger.warning(__('Malformed option description %r, should now '
                      'also accept "[enable=]opt", in addition to '
                      '"opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", '
                      '"/opt args" or "+opt args"'), potential_option,
                   location=signode)
</patched>
```

Please note, the actual regular expression (`option_desc_re`) needs to be retrieved from the Sphinx codebase and adjusted accordingly. The provided patch is a conceptual example showing how to make the regular expression more inclusive. After adjusting the regular expression, thorough testing should be conducted to ensure that the new pattern does not inadvertently allow invalid option descriptions or interfere with the parsing of other directives.
