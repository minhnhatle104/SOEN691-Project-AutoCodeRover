            "content": "To address the issue with the pretty printing of vectors in SymPy, particularly the incorrect representation and baseline alignment, we need to gather more context about how pretty printing is implemented for vectors in SymPy. The issue mentions the use of `CoordSysCartesian` and the operation involving a vector component (`e.j`). We should start by looking into the classes and methods that handle pretty printing for vectors.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `CoordSysCartesian` class to understand its structure and any relevant pretty printing methods it might have.\n2. Search for methods related to pretty printing in the `vector` module, as the issue seems to be related to how vectors are pretty-printed.\n3. Specifically, since the issue involves an operation and its result being pretty-printed incorrectly, it would be useful to search for any method that might be responsible for handling the pretty printing of operations involving vectors.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"CoordSysCartesian\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"pretty_print\", \"vector\")\nsearch_method(\"pretty_print\")\n```"
