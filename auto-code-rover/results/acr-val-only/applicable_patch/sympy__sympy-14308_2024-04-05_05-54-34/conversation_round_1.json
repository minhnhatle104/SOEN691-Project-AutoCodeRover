We should start by looking into the classes and methods that handle pretty printing for vectors.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls:\n\n1.

Search for methods related to pretty printing in the `vector` module, as the issue seems to be related to how vectors are pretty-printed.\n3.

This could mean that the class has been renamed, moved, or the issue description uses an outdated name. SymPy's vector module has undergone changes, and the class might now be named differently, such as `CoordSys3D`.\n\n2. **Pretty Printing in the Vector Module**: The search for a `pretty_print` method in a class named `vector` did not yield results, indicating there might not be a direct pretty printing method within a class specifically named `vector`. This suggests that pretty printing for vectors might be handled more generically or by another mechanism within SymPy.\n\n3. **Pretty Printing Method Found**: A `pretty_print` function was found in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. This function is responsible for printing expressions in a pretty form, which includes handling line wrapping, unicode characters, precision, and order. It uses a `pretty` function internally to generate the pretty form of the expression before printing it.\n\nGiven these insights, the issue with pretty printing vectors breaking and incorrect baseline alignment likely stems from how the `pretty` function processes vector expressions. Since the `pretty_print` function delegates the actual formatting to the `pretty` function, the next step would be to investigate how vector expressions are handled by the `pretty` function. This would involve looking into how expressions involving vectors and operations on them are converted into a pretty form, especially focusing on unicode handling and alignment issues.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into the `pretty` function mentioned in the `pretty_print` method's code, specifically how it deals with vector expressions or components like `e.j`. This would help identify where the formatting issue originates and what adjustments are needed to correct the pretty printing of vectors."
