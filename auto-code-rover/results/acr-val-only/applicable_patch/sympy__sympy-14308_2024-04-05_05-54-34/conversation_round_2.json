This could mean that the class has been renamed, moved, or the issue description uses an outdated name. SymPy's vector module has undergone changes, and the class might now be named differently, such as `CoordSys3D`.\n\n2. **Pretty Printing in the Vector Module**: The search for a `pretty_print` method in a class named `vector` did not yield results, indicating there might not be a direct pretty printing method within a class specifically named `vector`. This suggests that pretty printing for vectors might be handled more generically or by another mechanism within SymPy.\n\n3. **Pretty Printing Method Found**: A `pretty_print` function was found in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. This function is responsible for printing expressions in a pretty form, which includes handling line wrapping, unicode characters, precision, and order. It uses a `pretty` function internally to generate the pretty form of the expression before printing it.\n\nGiven these insights, the issue with pretty printing vectors breaking and incorrect baseline alignment likely stems from how the `pretty` function processes vector expressions. Since the `pretty_print` function delegates the actual formatting to the `pretty` function, the next step would be to investigate how vector expressions are handled by the `pretty` function. This would involve looking into how expressions involving vectors and operations on them are converted into a pretty form, especially focusing on unicode handling and alignment issues.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into the `pretty` function mentioned in the `pretty_print` method's code, specifically how it deals with vector expressions or components like `e.j`. This would help identify where the formatting issue originates and what adjustments are needed to correct the pretty printing of vectors."

The `pretty` method appears in several files, indicating that pretty printing is a feature extensively tested and used across different parts of the SymPy library, including physics, vector, and printing modules. Here's a breakdown of where the `pretty` method appears:\n\n1. **Physics Quantum Printing Tests (`sympy/physics/quantum/tests/test_printing.py`)**: This file contains tests for pretty printing in the quantum physics module. While it's related to pretty printing, the issue at hand is specific to vectors, so this file is likely not where the bug originates but could provide insights into how pretty printing is tested.\n\n2. **Vector Printing Tests (`sympy/vector/tests/test_printing.py`)**: This file is particularly relevant because it directly relates to vector pretty printing. It likely contains tests for pretty printing vectors, which could help us understand the expected behavior and possibly identify why the issue occurs.\n\n3. **Pretty Printing Implementation (`sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`)**: We already identified this file from the previous search. It contains the implementation of the `pretty_print` method, which is central to the pretty printing functionality. The `pretty` method within this file is responsible for generating the pretty form of expressions, and any issues with vector pretty printing could stem from here.\n\n4. **Pretty Printing Tests (`sympy/printing/pretty/tests/test_pretty.py`)**: This file contains tests for the pretty printing functionality. It's useful for understanding the intended behavior of pretty printing across different types of expressions and could highlight cases where vector pretty printing is expected to behave in a certain way.\n\nBased on this analysis, the bug locations are likely within the implementation of the `pretty` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and how it interacts with vector expressions. Additionally, the tests in `sympy/vector/tests/test_printing.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/tests/test_pretty.py` could provide insights into the expected behavior and potentially reveal cases that are not handled correctly.\n\nTo further diagnose and fix the issue, we should examine the implementation of the `pretty` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` for how it handles vector expressions, specifically looking for how it deals with operations on vectors and their alignment. We should also review the tests in `sympy/vector/tests/test_printing.py` to understand the expected outcomes and identify any missing test cases that could have caught this issue."
