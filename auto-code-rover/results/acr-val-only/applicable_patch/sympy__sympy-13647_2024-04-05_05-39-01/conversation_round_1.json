        "content": "Given the error message indicating that the `Matrix` class could not be found in the codebase, it suggests a couple of possibilities:\n\n1. **The class name might be incorrect or misspelled**: It's possible that the class name provided to the search API was not accurate. However, given that `Matrix` is a well-known class in the SymPy library, this seems less likely unless there's a significant restructuring or renaming in the library that hasn't been accounted for.\n\n2. **The class is part of a module or namespace that wasn't specified**: In large libraries like SymPy, classes are often organized into modules or namespaces. If the search functionality requires specifying the full path or the specific module where a class is located, the search for `Matrix` might fail without this information.\n\n3. **Technical limitations or issues with the search API**: There could be a technical glitch or limitation with the search API that prevented it from finding the `Matrix` class. This could be due to indexing issues, recent changes in the codebase that haven't been reflected in the search index, or other technical challenges.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the next steps could involve:\n\n- Verifying the class name and ensuring it's spelled correctly.\n- Checking if the class is part of a specific module or namespace that needs to be included in the search query.\n- Exploring alternative ways to locate the method or class, such as searching for the method across the entire codebase without specifying the class, or looking for code snippets that might reveal more about the structure and organization of the library.\n\nSince the initial search for the method within the class failed, it might be beneficial to attempt a broader search for the method across the entire codebase to gather more context about its implementation and potential issues related to the bug described in the issue."
