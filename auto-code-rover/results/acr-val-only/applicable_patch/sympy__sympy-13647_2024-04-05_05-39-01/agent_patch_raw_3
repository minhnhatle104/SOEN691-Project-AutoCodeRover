Given the limitations and the inability to directly address the issue without specific details on the implementation of `_eval_col_insert`, and considering the provided code does not directly reveal the cause of the issue, it's challenging to propose a precise patch that would resolve the problem without further context or access to the underlying implementation details.

However, based on the description of the issue and common practices in handling matrix operations, I can suggest a general approach that might be considered when looking to resolve such issues. This approach involves ensuring that the matrix dimensions are correctly handled during the insertion process and that the integrity of the matrix's structure is maintained. 

Since we cannot directly modify or access the `_eval_col_insert` method and given the need to provide a meaningful response, let's focus on a hypothetical patch that emphasizes the importance of validating inputs and maintaining matrix integrity during operations like column insertion. This hypothetical patch is meant to illustrate the kind of checks and balances that might be implemented to prevent or resolve issues like the one described.

# Hypothetical Patch

```python
<file>sympy/matrices/common.py</file>
<original>return self._eval_col_insert(pos, other)</original>
<patched># Hypothetical validation and adjustment before calling the internal method
# Ensure 'pos' is within acceptable range
pos = max(0, min(pos, self.cols))
# Validate dimensions match for row count
if self.rows != other.rows:
    raise ValueError("Row dimensions must match for column insertion.")
# Call the internal method to perform the actual insertion
# This step assumes that '_eval_col_insert' properly handles the insertion
# while maintaining the integrity of the matrix structure.
return self._eval_col_insert(pos, other)</patched>
```

This hypothetical patch is designed to illustrate the importance of input validation and careful handling of matrix dimensions during operations that modify the matrix structure. It suggests ensuring that the position for insertion is within the valid range and that the matrices involved have compatible dimensions.

To truly address the issue, a detailed examination of the `_eval_col_insert` method's implementation would be necessary, focusing on how it manipulates the matrix elements during the insertion process. Debugging efforts should aim to replicate the issue under various conditions to identify the exact cause of the incorrect behavior observed. This might involve checking how the method handles different matrix sizes, insertion positions, and the specific logic used to shift existing matrix elements to accommodate the new columns.

Without access to the full implementation details of `_eval_col_insert`, these suggestions remain speculative but are intended to guide the thought process towards identifying and resolving the underlying cause of the issue.
