Given the feedback and the need to revise the approach, let's focus on ensuring that the primary key (PK) is set to `None` in a way that does not interfere with the deletion process and passes all tests. The goal is to adjust the deletion process so that after a successful deletion, the PK of the instance is set to `None`, reflecting that the instance no longer exists in the database.

Considering the provided code snippets and the requirement, it seems the initial approach to modify the `Collector` class in `django/db/models/deletion.py` might not be the most effective, as it could interfere with Django's deletion process in unexpected ways. Instead, ensuring that the PK is set to `None` should be handled at the model instance level after the deletion process has successfully completed, which aligns with the modification in `django/db/models/base.py`.

However, the initial patch might have been too invasive or incorrectly placed. Let's refine the modification to ensure it's applied correctly and does not cause test failures.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/db/models/base.py</file>
<original>        collector.collect([self], keep_parents=keep_parents)
        return collector.delete()</original>
<patched>        collector.collect([self], keep_parents=keep_parents)
        deleted_count, deleted_details = collector.delete()
        # Ensure the PK is set to None only if the deletion was successful
        if deleted_count > 0:
            self.pk = None
        return deleted_count, deleted_details</patched>
```

This revised modification ensures that the primary key is set to `None` only after confirming that the deletion was successful, indicated by `deleted_count > 0`. This approach minimizes the risk of unintended side effects and should align with Django's design principles by keeping the change localized to the model's `delete` method, where the deletion process concludes.
