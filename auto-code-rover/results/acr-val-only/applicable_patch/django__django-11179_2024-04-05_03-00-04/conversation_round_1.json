The reference to \"Django.db.models.deletion:276-281\" seems to be intended to point to a specific section of code within Django's deletion mechanism, but the search did not yield results, possibly due to incorrect file path formatting or an outdated reference.\n\nTo proceed with gathering context and understanding the issue, we need to adjust our approach. The issue describes a problem where deleting a model instance that has no dependencies does not clear its primary key (PK), which should be set to `None` after a `.delete()` call. This behavior is expected to be handled within Django's model deletion code, likely in a method that handles the deletion process.\n\nGiven this, we should focus on finding the relevant deletion method or function within Django's model system that would be responsible for this behavior. Since the direct file reference was unsuccessful, we can attempt to search more broadly for the deletion method and then inspect the code around it for the correct lines.\n\nLet's proceed with a more general search to find the method responsible for handling model deletion in Django:\n\n1. **Search for the deletion method in the Django model system**: Since the `.delete()` method is a common part of Django's ORM, we can search for this method within the context of Django's models to find where the deletion logic is implemented.\n\n2. **Search for the class that might be responsible for model deletion**: If the direct method search is too broad, we might need to identify the specific class in Django's codebase that handles model deletion, such as a deletion handler or a base model class where `.delete()` is defined.\n\nBased on this approach, let's start with:\n\n- `search_method(\"delete\")` to find the `.delete()` method implementations in the Django codebase.\n\nThis should help us identify the right place in the code where the primary key should be set to `None` after a model instance is deleted, allowing us to then propose a patch to fix the issue."
