Given the analysis and the context provided, a hypothetical patch to address the issue with `ModelForm` fields with callable defaults not correctly propagating default values in inline forms within the Django admin interface could look like the following. This patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach based on common Django patterns and the described issue. It assumes that the problem might be related to how default values are handled for `ArrayField` in inline forms upon form validation and resubmission.

### modification 1
Adjusting the `ArrayField`'s `formfield` method to ensure default values are correctly handled in form fields, especially in the context of the Django admin.

```python
<file>django/contrib/postgres/fields/array.py</file>
<original>
def formfield(self, **kwargs):
    return super().formfield(
        **{
            "form_class": SimpleArrayField,
            "base_field": self.base_field.formfield(),
            "max_length": self.size,
            **kwargs,
        }
    )
</original>
<patched>
def formfield(self, **kwargs):
    # Ensure the base_field's formfield correctly handles callable defaults
    base_field_formfield = self.base_field.formfield()
    if callable(base_field_formfield.initial):
        base_field_formfield.initial = base_field_formfield.initial()
    
    return super().formfield(
        **{
            "form_class": SimpleArrayField,
            "base_field": base_field_formfield,
            "max_length": self.size,
            **kwargs,
        }
    )
</patched>
```

### modification 2
Ensuring the Django admin interface correctly handles formset validation and the propagation of default values upon form resubmission.

```python
<file>django/contrib/admin/options.py</file>
<original>
def save_formset(self, request, form, formset, change):
    """
    Given an inline formset save it to the database.
    """
    formset.save()
</original>
<patched>
def save_formset(self, request, form, formset, change):
    """
    Given an inline formset save it to the database.
    Ensure default values are correctly handled on form resubmission.
    """
    # Force re-evaluation of formset defaults before saving
    for form in formset.forms:
        for field in form.fields.values():
            if callable(field.initial):
                field.initial = field.initial()
                
    formset.save()
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are speculative and based on a general understanding of Django's form and model system. They aim to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the described issue. Before applying any changes, thorough testing in a development environment is crucial to ensure they effectively address the issue without introducing new problems.
