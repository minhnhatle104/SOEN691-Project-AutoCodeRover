This modification attempts to calculate the velocity of a point in a given reference frame if it has not been explicitly set. It does so by iterating through the position vectors defined in `_pos_dict`, taking their time derivative with respect to the frame. If a valid velocity vector is found, it sets this velocity for the point in the frame and returns it. If no valid velocity can be calculated, it raises the original `ValueError`. This approach aligns with the expectation that the velocity could be derived from the position vector's time derivative, similar to how angular velocities are computed based on orientation relationships.
