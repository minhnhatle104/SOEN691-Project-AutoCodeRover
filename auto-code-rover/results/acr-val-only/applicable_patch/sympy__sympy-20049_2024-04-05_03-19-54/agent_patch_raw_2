Given the feedback and the need to refine the approach, let's consider a more robust solution that directly addresses the calculation of velocity based on the position vector's time derivative, without relying on iterating through `_pos_dict`. This approach will directly attempt to calculate the velocity if it's not found in `_vel_dict`, by using the derivative of the position vector relative to another point if such a relationship exists.

        If the velocity has not been explicitly set, this method attempts to
        calculate it based on the position vector's time derivative relative to
        any point for which the position has been defined.

```

This revised patch directly attempts to calculate the velocity of the point in the specified frame if it hasn't been explicitly set, by leveraging the time derivative of the position vector (`pos_vector.dt(frame)`) for any point for which the position has been defined relative to the point in question. This approach is more aligned with the expected behavior described in the issue, ensuring that velocity can be derived in a manner similar to how angular velocities are computed based on orientation relationships.
