Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach to directly handle the complex exponent by extracting its real part might not be the correct solution, especially considering the context of trigonometric simplification in SymPy. Let's revise the approach to address the issue of comparing a complex exponent in a way that avoids the invalid comparison altogether.

# modification 1
```python
<file>simplify/fu.py</file>
<original>if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
            return rv
        if (rv.exp > max) == True:
            return rv</original>
<patched># Check if the exponent is a number and not complex before comparison
        if isinstance(rv.exp, (int, float, sympy.Integer, sympy.Rational)) and not isinstance(rv.exp, sympy.core.numbers.ComplexNumber):
            if rv.exp < 0:
                return rv
            if rv.exp > max:
                return rv</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the comparison of the exponent to numerical values only occurs if the exponent is indeed a type that can be validly compared (i.e., real numbers including integers and floats, as well as SymPy's `Integer` and `Rational` types), and explicitly excludes complex numbers by checking against `sympy.core.numbers.ComplexNumber`. This approach should prevent the TypeError from being raised due to invalid comparison with a complex number.
