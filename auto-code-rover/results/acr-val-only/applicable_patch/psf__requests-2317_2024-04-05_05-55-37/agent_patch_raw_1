<original>        method = builtin_str(method)</original>
<patched>        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('utf-8')
        else:
            method = str(method)</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by checking if the `method` variable is an instance of `bytes`. If it is, it decodes the `method` to a UTF-8 string, ensuring compatibility with Python 3's string handling. If `method` is not a bytes instance, it converts it to a string using the standard `str()` function, which should maintain compatibility with existing code that already provides the method as a string. This approach avoids the problem of converting binary strings like `b'GET'` into the incorrect form `"b'GET'"`, ensuring that the HTTP method is correctly recognized.
