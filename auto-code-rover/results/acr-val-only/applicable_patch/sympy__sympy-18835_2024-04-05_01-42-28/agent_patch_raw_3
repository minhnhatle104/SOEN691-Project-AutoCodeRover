Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the initial approach and the subsequent revision did not adequately address the issue. The core challenge is to prevent or handle modifications to the list during iteration in a way that is both effective and consistent with Python's expectations for such operations. Reflecting on the problem and the limitations of previous attempts, let's consider a different approach that directly addresses the concern raised in the issue without altering the fundamental behavior of the `uniq` function.

The primary goal is to detect if the sequence being iterated over by `uniq` is modified during the iteration, which is not directly supported by the initial implementation. However, the initial solution attempt and its revision may have misunderstood the problem's scope or applied an incorrect fix strategy.

Given this, a more appropriate solution would involve adding a mechanism to `uniq` that checks for modifications to the input sequence if it is a type that supports length checking (e.g., lists) without fundamentally changing how `uniq` operates for other iterable types.

This modification introduces a direct check for sequences that support the `__len__` method, which includes lists but excludes types like generators for which the length cannot be determined without consuming the items. By checking the length of the sequence at the start and then re-checking it each time an item is yielded, the function can detect if the sequence has been modified during iteration and raise a `RuntimeError` if so. This approach aligns with the behavior of Python's built-in structures when modified during iteration and addresses the issue without altering the behavior for sequence types that do not support length checking.
