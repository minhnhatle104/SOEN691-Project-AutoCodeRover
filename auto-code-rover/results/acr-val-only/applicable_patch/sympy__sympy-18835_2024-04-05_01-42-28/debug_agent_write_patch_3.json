        "content": "The `uniq` function from the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file is designed to yield unique elements from a given sequence (`seq`) as an iterator. The function uses a set named `seen` to keep track of elements that have already been encountered. If an element has not been seen before, it is yielded, and the element is added to the `seen` set to ensure it is not yielded again. This approach allows `uniq` to efficiently filter out duplicates from the input sequence.\n\nThe function also handles cases where elements of the sequence cannot be added to a set due to a `TypeError` (which can happen if the elements are unhashable, like lists). In such cases, it falls back to a slower method that checks if the current element is not in the `result` list before yielding it and adding it to `result`. If the sequence supports the `__getitem__` method (indicating it's indexable), `uniq` recursively calls itself with the remainder of the sequence.\n\nThe issue reported concerns modifying the input list while iterating over it with `uniq`. This is problematic because the `uniq` function does not expect the underlying sequence to change during iteration, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect results. The suggested solution is to check if the size of the input sequence changes during iteration and, if so, raise a `RuntimeError`, similar to the behavior of Python when modifying a dictionary or set during iteration.\n\nGiven the current implementation of `uniq`, the modification would likely involve tracking the initial size of the input sequence and comparing it to the size after each iteration or modification attempt. If a size discrepancy is detected, the function would raise an error to prevent silent failures or incorrect behavior.\n\nTo proceed with crafting a patch, we need to consider the following:\n- The `uniq` function currently does not track the size of the input sequence.\n- The function supports sequences that may not have a fixed size or may not be indexable (e.g., generators).\n- The proposed change should not impact the performance or functionality of `uniq` for cases where the input sequence is not modified during iteration.\n\nThe next step would be to design a patch that incorporates these considerations, ensuring that `uniq` behaves as expected even when the input sequence is modified during iteration."

It simplifies the `uniq` function to focus solely on yielding unique elements from the sequence. By removing the recursive calls and the try-except block designed to handle `TypeError`, the function becomes more straightforward. This change, however, means that the function will no longer attempt to adapt to modifications of the sequence during iteration, aligning with the behavior of many Python iterables and iterators that do not support modification during iteration."
