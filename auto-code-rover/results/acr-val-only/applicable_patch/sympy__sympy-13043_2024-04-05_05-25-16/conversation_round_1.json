The issue description points out a problem with the order of the list returned by this function when `separate=True` is used, which leads to arbitrary ordering because it returns `list(poly_dict.values())`.\n\nGiven this context, the next logical step is to look into the implementation of the `decompose` function within `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` to understand how it handles the `separate=True` parameter and how it currently returns the list of values from `poly_dict`. This will help in identifying the exact part of the code that needs modification to ensure a consistent order of the returned list or to evaluate the suggestion of returning a set instead.\n\nTo proceed, I will need to examine the specific implementation of the `decompose` method in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`. This involves looking at how `poly_dict` is being used and manipulated within the function, especially in relation to the `separate` parameter.\n\nLet's focus on the `decompose` method within the `intpoly.py` file to gather more detailed information about its implementation and the handling of the `separate` parameter."
