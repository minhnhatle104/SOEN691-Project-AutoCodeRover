Given the context and the code provided, the issue seems to stem from the fact that `manage.py` is not being watched by the autoreloader. The `watched_files` method in `django/utils/autoreload.py` is responsible for yielding files to be watched but does not explicitly include `manage.py`. To resolve this issue, we can modify the `watched_files` method to ensure `manage.py` is included in the list of files to watch. This approach assumes that `manage.py` is located in the root directory of the project, which is the standard location.

```python
<file>django/utils/autoreload.py</file>
<original>def watched_files(self, include_globs=True):
        """
        Yield all files that need to be watched, including module files and
        files within globs.
        """
        yield from iter_all_python_module_files()
        yield from self.extra_files
        if include_globs:
            for directory, patterns in self.directory_globs.items():
                for pattern in patterns:
                    yield from directory.glob(pattern)</original>
<patched>import os
def watched_files(self, include_globs=True):
        """
        Yield all files that need to be watched, including module files and
        files within globs.
        """
        # Ensure manage.py is included in the list of watched files
        manage_py_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'manage.py')
        if os.path.exists(manage_py_path):
            yield manage_py_path
        yield from iter_all_python_module_files()
        yield from self.extra_files
        if include_globs:
            for directory, patterns in self.directory_globs.items():
                for pattern in patterns:
                    yield from directory.glob(pattern)</patched>
```

This patch adds a check to include `manage.py` in the list of watched files by the autoreloader. It dynamically constructs the path to `manage.py` based on the assumption that `django/utils/autoreload.py` is two directories deep from the project root. This approach should work for standard Django project structures but may need adjustment for projects with a non-standard layout.
