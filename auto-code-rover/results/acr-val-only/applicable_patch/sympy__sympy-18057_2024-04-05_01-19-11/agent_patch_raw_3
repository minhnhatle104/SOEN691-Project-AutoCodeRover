Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations of previous attempts, it's clear that a direct modification to avoid or replace `eval` without breaking existing functionality is challenging. The core issue lies in the dynamic evaluation of strings that could represent arbitrary code, which is inherently risky and difficult to secure completely without restricting SymPy's flexibility.

A more refined approach would involve enhancing the safety of the evaluation context itself, rather than trying to avoid `eval` altogether or adding regex-based checks, which can be bypassed or may not cover all edge cases. This involves creating a more controlled environment for evaluation that limits what can be executed. However, given the nature of SymPy and the need to evaluate symbolic expressions dynamically, completely eliminating all risks associated with `eval` might not be feasible without significant changes to the library's architecture and functionality.

Since a fully secure patch that doesn't impact existing functionality seems difficult to achieve within the constraints of this format, and considering the complexity of safely evaluating arbitrary expressions in Python, the following is a conceptual approach rather than a direct code patch. This approach focuses on enhancing the safety of the evaluation context:

### Conceptual Approach:

1. **Limit the Evaluation Context**: Modify the evaluation context provided to `eval` in both `sympify` and related parsing functions to strictly limit the available functions and variables. This involves creating a whitelist of safe functions and symbols that can be used in expressions.

2. **Use AST Parsing for Validation**: Before evaluating any string with `eval`, parse it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using Python's `ast` module. Analyze the AST to ensure that it only contains operations and functions that are deemed safe. This can help prevent the execution of arbitrary code.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling around `eval` to catch and handle exceptions more gracefully. This can help prevent partial execution of malicious code.

4. **Security Audit and Testing**: Conduct a thorough security audit of the evaluation logic and implement a comprehensive suite of tests designed to catch potential security vulnerabilities related to dynamic expression evaluation.

### Note:

Implementing these changes requires a deep understanding of both SymPy's internals and Python's security model. It's also important to recognize that any use of `eval` carries inherent risks, especially when evaluating untrusted input. In some cases, it may be necessary to reconsider the design decisions that lead to the use of `eval` for evaluating symbolic expressions, exploring alternative approaches that can provide the required functionality with lower risk.

Given the complexity and potential security implications, contributions from multiple developers with expertise in Python security, SymPy's architecture, and symbolic mathematics would be invaluable in addressing this issue effectively.
