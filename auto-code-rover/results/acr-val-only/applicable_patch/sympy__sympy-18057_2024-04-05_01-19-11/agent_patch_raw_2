Given the constraints and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, a more nuanced approach is required. The core of the problem lies in the use of `eval` for evaluating string representations, which can be unsafe and lead to unexpected behavior. A safer approach would involve enhancing the validation and parsing logic to avoid executing arbitrary code through `eval`. However, completely replacing `eval` might not be feasible due to its dynamic nature and the broad range of expressions it can handle. 

Instead, the patch will focus on adding a layer of safety checks before resorting to `eval`, specifically targeting the scenario described in the issue. This approach aims to minimize the impact on existing functionality and tests while addressing the security concern.

```

This modification introduces a preliminary check for string inputs to `sympify`, using a regular expression to filter out strings that contain potentially unsafe characters or patterns. This is a basic and conservative approach, aiming to block obvious attempts to exploit the `eval` usage without significantly altering the behavior for valid inputs. 

**Note**: The regex used in the patch is quite simplistic and may need to be adjusted to more accurately capture the range of safe or unsafe inputs. The goal is to illustrate the concept of adding a safety check; the exact implementation may require further refinement based on the specific requirements and constraints of SymPy's parsing capabilities.
