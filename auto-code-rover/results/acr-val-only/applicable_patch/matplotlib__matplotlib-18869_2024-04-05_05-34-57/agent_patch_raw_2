Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to address the issue of adding easily comparable version info to Matplotlib, focusing on enhancing the usability and accessibility of version comparison features without causing test failures. The initial attempt aimed to make `__version_tuple__` accessible via `__getattr__`, but considering the feedback, a more direct and less error-prone approach might be needed.

Here's a revised patch that introduces a `version_info` tuple directly in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, similar to how Python's own `sys.version_info` works. This approach avoids potential issues with dynamic attribute access and makes version comparison straightforward and idiomatic to Python users.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>def __getattr__(name):
    if name == "__version__":
        import setuptools_scm
        global __version__  # cache it.
        # Only shell out to a git subprocess if really needed, and not on a
        # shallow clone, such as those used by CI, as the latter would trigger
        # a warning from setuptools_scm.
        root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
        if (root / ".git").exists() and not (root / ".git/shallow").exists():
            __version__ = setuptools_scm.get_version(
                root=root,
                version_scheme="post-release",
                local_scheme="node-and-date",
                fallback_version=_version.version,
            )
        else:  # Get the version from the _version.py setuptools_scm file.
            __version__ = _version.version
        return __version__
    raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__!r} has no attribute {name!r}")
</original>
<patched>def __getattr__(name):
    if name == "__version__":
        import setuptools_scm
        global __version__  # cache it.
        # Only shell out to a git subprocess if really needed, and not on a
        # shallow clone, such as those used by CI, as the latter would trigger
        # a warning from setuptools_scm.
        root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
        if (root / ".git").exists() and not (root / ".git/shallow").exists():
            __version__ = setuptools_scm.get_version(
                root=root,
                version_scheme="post-release",
                local_scheme="node-and-date",
                fallback_version=_version.version,
            )
        else:  # Get the version from the _version.py setuptools_scm file.
            __version__ = _version.version
        return __version__
    raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__!r} has no attribute {name!r}")

# Directly after the __getattr__ definition or at the end of the file
import _version
version_info = _version.__version_tuple__
</patched>
```

This modification directly assigns `version_info` from `_version.__version_tuple__` in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, making it readily available for import and comparison by users. This approach ensures that `version_info` is a first-class citizen in the Matplotlib package, similar to how version information is exposed in other Python packages and the Python standard library itself.

By directly defining `version_info` in this manner, we avoid the complexities and potential issues related to dynamic attribute access through `__getattr__`, aiming for a solution that is both straightforward and compatible with existing tests and usage patterns.
