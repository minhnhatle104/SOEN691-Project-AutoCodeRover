Given the constraints and the feedback received, let's approach the problem with a fresh perspective. The goal remains to add easily comparable version info to Matplotlib in a way that is both accessible and does not interfere with existing functionalities or cause test failures.

Considering the limitations of previous attempts, we'll focus on ensuring compatibility and minimizing the impact on the existing codebase. This time, we'll explicitly define a `version_info` tuple at the module level in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, similar to Python's `sys.version_info`, and ensure it's derived from the already existing `__version__` or `__version_tuple__` in `_version.py`. This approach avoids modifying the dynamic attribute access mechanism and directly provides what's needed.

        # shallow clone, such as those used by CI, as the latter would trigger
        # a warning from setuptools_scm.
        root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
        if (root / ".git").exists() and not (root / ".git/shallow").exists():

        else:  # Get the version from the _version.py setuptools_scm file.

        else:  # Get the version from the _version.py setuptools_scm file.
            __version__ = _version.version
        return __version__
    raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__!r} has no attribute {name!r}")

# At the beginning of the file, after the module docstring
from . import _version
version_info = tuple(int(part) if part.isdigit() else part for part in _version.__version__.split('.'))
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a `version_info` tuple directly after importing `_version`, parsing the `__version__` string into a tuple. This approach is straightforward, leveraging Python's ability to handle version strings and tuples for comparison purposes. It avoids altering the existing dynamic attribute handling mechanism (`__getattr__`) and provides a clear, immutable, and easily comparable `version_info` tuple at the module level.

This solution should meet the requirements of adding easily comparable version info without causing test failures or compatibility issues, assuming that the version format in `_version.__version__` is consistent and can be split into parts that are either integers or strings.
