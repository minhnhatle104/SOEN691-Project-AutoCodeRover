Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that a direct approach to modifying the existing methods without introducing new hypothetical methods or altering the logic significantly is required. The challenge is to ensure that when `defer` and `only` are used in conjunction, the expected fields are either deferred or loaded immediately as intended, without introducing additional methods or relying on hypothetical implementations.

Considering the original issue and the limitations of the previous patches, let's focus on refining the logic within the existing methods to better handle the intersection of deferred and immediate loading without assuming additional utility methods.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>    def add_deferred_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        if defer:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.union(field_names), True
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.difference(field_names), False
</original>
<patched>    def add_deferred_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        # Adjust logic to ensure that fields already marked for immediate loading are not deferred.
        immediate_fields = set(self.get_loaded_field_names())
        field_names_set = set(field_names)
        # Exclude fields marked for immediate loading from the new deferred set.
        new_deferred_fields = field_names_set - immediate_fields
        if defer:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.union(new_deferred_fields), True
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.difference(new_deferred_fields), False
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>    def add_immediate_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        field_names = set(field_names)
        if 'pk' in field_names:
            field_names.remove('pk')
            field_names.add(self.get_meta().pk.name)
        if defer:
            self.deferred_loading = field_names.difference(existing), False
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = frozenset(field_names), False
</original>
<patched>    def add_immediate_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        field_names_set = set(field_names)
        if 'pk' in field_names_set:
            field_names_set.remove('pk')
            field_names_set.add(self.get_meta().pk.name)
        # Adjust logic to ensure that fields already marked for deferred loading are now marked for immediate loading.
        if defer:
            # Instead of simply removing deferred fields, ensure they are now considered for immediate loading.
            new_immediate_fields = field_names_set.union(existing)
            self.deferred_loading = new_immediate_fields.difference(existing), False
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = frozenset(field_names_set), False
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to directly address the issue within the constraints of the existing methods and the provided context. The focus is on ensuring that when fields are specified in both `defer` and `only`, the logic within `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` correctly handles the intersection, prioritizing immediate loading as specified by the `only` method, and properly managing the deferred fields to prevent unintended loading behavior.
