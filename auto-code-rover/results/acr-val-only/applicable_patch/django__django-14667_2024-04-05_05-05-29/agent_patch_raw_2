Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, it's clear that the approach to modifying the `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods needs to be reconsidered. The goal remains to ensure that the chaining of `defer` and `only` methods works as expected, particularly when the same fields are involved in both operations. Let's attempt a different approach that focuses on improving how deferred and immediate loading settings are merged when both methods are used in sequence.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>    def add_deferred_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        if defer:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.union(field_names), True
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.difference(field_names), False
</original>
<patched>    def add_deferred_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        # Ensure that fields set for immediate loading are not deferred.
        immediate_fields = self.get_immediate_loading_fields()
        effective_field_names = set(field_names) - immediate_fields
        if defer:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.union(effective_field_names), True
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = existing.difference(effective_field_names), False
        # Update to ensure immediate fields are not inadvertently deferred.
        self.update_immediate_loading_fields(immediate_fields - set(field_names))
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>    def add_immediate_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        field_names = set(field_names)
        if 'pk' in field_names:
            field_names.remove('pk')
            field_names.add(self.get_meta().pk.name)
        if defer:
            self.deferred_loading = field_names.difference(existing), False
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = frozenset(field_names), False
</original>
<patched>    def add_immediate_loading(self, field_names):
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        field_names = set(field_names)
        if 'pk' in field_names:
            field_names.remove('pk')
            field_names.add(self.get_meta().pk.name)
        # Ensure that fields set for deferred loading are prioritized for immediate loading if specified.
        deferred_fields = self.get_deferred_loading_fields()
        effective_field_names = field_names - deferred_fields
        if defer:
            self.deferred_loading = effective_field_names.difference(existing), False
        else:
            self.deferred_loading = frozenset(effective_field_names), False
        # Explicitly remove fields from deferred loading if they are now set for immediate loading.
        self.remove_from_deferred_loading(field_names)
</patched>
```

In this revised approach, the modifications aim to more carefully manage the intersection between deferred and immediate loading fields. Specifically, when adding fields to either deferred or immediate loading, the patch now considers the current state of the other loading set (deferred vs. immediate) and adjusts accordingly. This should ensure that fields are not incorrectly loaded or deferred based on the sequence of `defer` and `only` method calls.

Note: The methods `get_immediate_loading_fields`, `update_immediate_loading_fields`, and `remove_from_deferred_loading` are hypothetical and would need to be implemented based on the actual structure and methods available in the `Query` class, as the provided context does not include their definitions. This approach assumes the existence of utility methods to manage the sets of deferred and immediate loading fields more granitely.
