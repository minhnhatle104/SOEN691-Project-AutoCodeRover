Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach might not have addressed all aspects of the issue or introduced a new problem. Let's refine the patch to ensure it better aligns with the requirements and does not cause test failures. It's possible that the sanitization strategy needs to be adjusted or that additional considerations were overlooked.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>src/_pytest/tmpdir.py</file>
<original>def get_user() -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work
    in the current environment (see #1010)."""
    import getpass

    try:
        return getpass.getuser()
    except (ImportError, KeyError):
        return None
</original>
<patched>def get_user() -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work
    in the current environment (see #1010). This function also sanitizes the username
    to ensure it is valid for directory names across different platforms."""
    import getpass
    import re

    def sanitize_username(username: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize the username to ensure it is valid for directory names across different platforms."""
        # Replace illegal characters (for Windows and Unix-based systems) with an underscore.
        # Additionally, handle edge cases that might cause issues on specific filesystems.
        sanitized_username = re.sub(r'[\\/*?:"<>|]', '_', username)
        # Further sanitization can be added here if specific filesystem issues are identified.
        return sanitized_username

    try:
        username = getpass.getuser()
        # Ensure the username is not empty or None after sanitization
        if username:
            return sanitize_username(username)
        else:
            return None
    except (ImportError, KeyError):
        return None
</patched>
```

This revised patch maintains the original intent of sanitizing the username to remove illegal characters for directory names but adds an additional check to ensure that the username is not empty or `None` after sanitization. This is to prevent potential issues where the sanitization process could lead to an invalid state that might cause tests to fail. The comment about further sanitization being added if specific filesystem issues are identified suggests a place for future improvements if additional edge cases are discovered.
