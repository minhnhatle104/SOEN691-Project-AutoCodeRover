I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\n```\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\ndef mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\n\"\"\"\nCreate a new directory at this given path.\n\"\"\"\nif self._closed:\nself._raise_closed()\ntry:\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\n```\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\n```bat\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\npy.test test_tmp.py\n```\nThanks for having a look at this!\n</issue>"

Let's analyze the collected context to understand how to approach the problem of `tmpdir` creation failing when the username contains illegal characters for directory names.\n\n### Analysis of Search Results\n\n1. **tmpdir Method in `tmpdir.py` and `pytester.py`:**\n   - Both instances of the `tmpdir` method return a `py.path.local` object representing a temporary directory path. The first instance in `tmpdir.py` is unique to each test function invocation and is created as a subdirectory of the base temporary directory. The second instance in `pytester.py` is specific to the `Testdir` class, providing a temporary directory where tests are executed.\n   - Neither of these directly uses `getpass.getuser()`, suggesting that the issue might not be within these methods themselves but possibly in how the base temporary directory is determined.\n\n2. **tmpdir_factory and tmp_path_factory Methods in `tmpdir.py`:**\n   - Both methods return instances (`TempdirFactory` and `TempPathFactory`, respectively) for the test session. These factories are likely responsible for creating the temporary directories.\n   - The methods themselves do not directly reference `getpass.getuser()`, but the factories they return could be using the username as part of the path for temporary directories, which is where the issue might arise.\n\n3. **Usage of `getpass.getuser()` in `tmpdir.py`:**\n   - The `get_user` function attempts to return the current username using `getpass.getuser()`. It catches exceptions if `getpass.getuser()` fails but does not handle the case where the username contains illegal characters for directory names.\n   - This is likely the critical point where the issue originates. The username returned by `getpass.getuser()` is used without sanitization, leading to failures when creating directories with illegal characters.\n\n### Approach for Patching\n\nGiven this analysis, the solution should involve modifying how the username is processed before it's used to form directory paths. Specifically, we need to sanitize the username to remove or replace characters that are illegal in directory names. This could be implemented in or around the `get_user` function or possibly within the logic that constructs the temporary directory paths using the username.\n\nThe steps might involve:\n1. Identifying all characters that are illegal in directory names on Windows and other supported operating systems.\n2. Implementing a sanitization routine that replaces or removes these illegal characters from the username.\n3. Applying this routine to the username obtained from `getpass.getuser()` before it's used to construct directory paths.\n\nThis approach ensures that regardless of the characters in the username, the system can always create a valid directory path for temporary directories."
