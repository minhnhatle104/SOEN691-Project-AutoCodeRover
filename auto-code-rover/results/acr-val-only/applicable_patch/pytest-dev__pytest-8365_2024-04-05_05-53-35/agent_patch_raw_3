Given the constraints and the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue or caused test failures, it's clear that a different approach or additional considerations are needed. Since the direct modification to sanitize the username did not lead to a successful resolution, let's consider a more robust handling mechanism that might involve a fallback strategy for creating temporary directories when the username contains illegal characters. This approach will ensure that the system can always create a temporary directory, even if the username is not suitable for use in a file path.

# modification 1 (New Approach)
```python
<file>src/_pytest/tmpdir.py</file>
<original>def get_user() -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work
    in the current environment (see #1010)."""
    import getpass

    try:
        return getpass.getuser()
    except (ImportError, KeyError):
        return None
</original>
<patched>def get_user() -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work
    in the current environment (see #1010). This function also handles cases
    where the username contains characters not allowed in directory names by
    providing a generic fallback username."""
    import getpass

    try:
        username = getpass.getuser()
        # Check if the username is valid for use in file paths. This is a basic check,
        # and more sophisticated logic may be required for comprehensive validation.
        if not username.isalnum():
            # Provide a generic fallback username if the original username is not suitable.
            # This approach ensures that the system can always create a temporary directory.
            return "pytest_user"
        return username
    except (ImportError, KeyError):
        # In cases where getuser() does not work, return a generic username.
        return "pytest_user"
</patched>
```

This new approach introduces a basic validation check for the username obtained from `getpass.getuser()`, focusing on alphanumeric characters to ensure simplicity and broad compatibility. If the username contains characters that are not alphanumeric, a generic fallback username (`"pytest_user"`) is used instead. This strategy aims to provide a reliable way to create temporary directories without relying on potentially problematic usernames. Additionally, in cases where `getpass.getuser()` fails due to environmental issues, the same generic username is returned, ensuring consistency and reducing the likelihood of errors related to directory creation.
