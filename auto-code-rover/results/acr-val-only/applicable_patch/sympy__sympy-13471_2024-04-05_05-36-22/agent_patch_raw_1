                # Python 3 does not have 'long' type and 'L' suffix for long integers.
                # Convert hexadecimal string to integer, handling Python 2 'L' suffix if present.

```

This patch modifies the `__new__` method of the `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py` to ensure compatibility with Python 3 by replacing the use of `long` with `int` for hexadecimal conversion. Additionally, it handles the potential 'L' suffix in the hexadecimal string that could be present in pickles created with Python 2, ensuring that the conversion to an integer is successful in Python 3 environments.
