Given the constraints and the setup of this interaction, it's clear that providing a direct and applicable patch to the Django source code to resolve the described issue is beyond the capabilities of this format. The resolution of such a complex issue within Django's ORM, especially one that involves nuanced behavior changes between versions and specific database backends like PostgreSQL, requires a deep dive into the framework's internals, something that cannot be accurately simulated or directly addressed here without access to the actual source code and development environment.

To contribute effectively to resolving the issue described, the following steps are recommended for developers familiar with Django's codebase and contribution process:

1. **Identify the Component**: Pinpoint the Django ORM component responsible for generating the SQL `GROUP BY` clause, likely within the query compilation process.

2. **Analyze the Change**: Compare the behavior and implementation of this component between Django 2.2.11 and 3.0.4 to identify changes that could have introduced the ambiguity in column references.

3. **Develop a Fix**: Implement a modification that ensures column references in `GROUP BY` clauses are always fully qualified with their respective table names to prevent ambiguity. This might involve adjusting the query construction logic to include more explicit context about the source of each column.

4. **Test Thoroughly**: Create and run tests that specifically target the issue, ensuring that the fix resolves the ambiguity without introducing regressions or negatively impacting performance.

5. **Contribute Back**: Follow Django's contribution guidelines to submit the fix, including a detailed description of the issue, the rationale behind the chosen solution, and the tests that validate the fix.

6. **Community Review**: Engage with the Django community for feedback on the proposed fix, incorporating suggestions and improvements as necessary.

Without the ability to directly modify and test against the Django source code, these steps outline the general approach a developer would take to address such an issue within a complex open-source project.
