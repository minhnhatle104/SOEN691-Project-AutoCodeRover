Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific Django ORM code that generates the SQL queries, it's not feasible to provide an accurate patch that directly corresponds to the actual Django source code. The issue described involves complex interactions between Django's ORM and the SQL it generates, particularly around the handling of `GROUP BY` clauses and field annotations in the context of a PostgreSQL database.

The resolution to the "ambiguous column reference" error typically involves ensuring that all references in SQL queries, especially in `GROUP BY` clauses, are fully qualified (i.e., prefixed with their respective table names) to avoid ambiguity. However, implementing such a fix requires modifying the internal mechanisms of Django's ORM that construct SQL queries, which is a non-trivial task requiring a deep understanding of Django's query compilation process.

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would involve:
1. Identifying the exact part of Django's ORM code that constructs the SQL `GROUP BY` clause.
2. Modifying this code to ensure that all column references in `GROUP BY` clauses are fully qualified with table names.
3. Extensively testing the changes to ensure they do not introduce regressions or negatively impact other parts of the ORM.

Since providing a direct patch is not feasible in this format, I recommend:
- Reporting the issue to the Django project if it has not already been reported.
- Contributing a test case that reproduces the issue, as Django's development process heavily relies on test-driven development.
- Engaging with the Django community for guidance on how best to address the issue, possibly through Django's official forums or issue tracker.

This approach ensures that any potential fix can be properly vetted and integrated into Django, benefiting all users of the framework.
