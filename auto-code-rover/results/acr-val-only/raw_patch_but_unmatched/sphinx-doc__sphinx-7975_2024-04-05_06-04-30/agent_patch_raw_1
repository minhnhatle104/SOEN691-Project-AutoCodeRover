Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem lies in how symbols are categorized and potentially how they are sorted or grouped in the index. The provided test method `test_create_single_index` from `tests/test_environment_indexentries.py` shows how symbols and other entries are expected to be categorized in the index. However, without access to the actual implementation of `IndexEntries(app.env).create_index(app.builder)`, we can infer the required change based on the described issue and the test method's assertions.

The issue describes that symbols like "_@_", "_£_", and "_←_" are split into two "Symbols" sections in the HTML output, which suggests that the sorting or grouping mechanism treats some symbols differently. Ideally, all symbols should be grouped under a single "Symbols" section. Since the actual implementation details that lead to this behavior are not provided, I will propose a hypothetical patch that could address a potential cause of this issue based on common patterns in handling such scenarios.

Assuming there's a method responsible for categorizing index entries into sections (which was not directly found in the provided code snippets), the patch would ensure that all symbol entries are uniformly recognized and grouped under a single "Symbols" category before generating the HTML output.

# Hypothetical Patch

```python
<file>sphinx/environment/indexentries.py</file>  # Hypothetical file path
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original code snippet, assuming there's a part where symbols are categorized
if entry.startswith(('@', '£', '←', ...)):  # This line is an example and might not exist in the actual code
    category = 'Symbols'
else:
    category = entry[0].upper()
</original>
<patched>
# Updated code to ensure all symbols are grouped under a single "Symbols" section
symbol_chars = ('@', '£', '←', '&', '9', ...)  # Extend this tuple with all symbols that should be treated equally
if entry[0] in symbol_chars or not entry[0].isalpha():
    category = 'Symbols'
else:
    category = entry[0].upper()
</patched>
```

This patch assumes that the categorization logic differentiates entries based on their starting character and that there's a specific check for symbols that currently misclassifies some of them into separate categories. By ensuring all non-alphabetic starting characters are uniformly categorized under "Symbols", this approach aims to consolidate all symbol entries into a single section.

Please note, the actual implementation details might differ significantly, and without access to the specific methods that perform the categorization and HTML anchor generation, this patch is speculative and intended to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the described issue.
