Given the limitations in directly accessing and modifying the actual implementation based on the provided context, and considering the nature of the issue described, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without more specific details on the implementation of the index generation and categorization logic within the Sphinx project.

The issue revolves around the handling of symbols in the index and their categorization into multiple "Symbols" sections, which is not directly addressed in the provided test method `test_create_single_index` from `tests/test_environment_indexentries.py`. This test method, however, does give us insight into how entries are expected to be categorized and could serve as a basis for unit testing any potential fix.

Given the constraints, the best course of action would be to suggest a general approach to resolving the issue based on standard practices for handling such categorization problems in indexing systems:

1. **Review and Modify the Index Categorization Logic**: The core of the solution would involve reviewing the logic that categorizes index entries into sections. This logic should be modified to ensure that all symbols are treated uniformly, possibly by checking if an entry's first character is a symbol and, if so, categorizing it under a single "Symbols" section.

2. **Ensure Unique HTML Anchors for Sections**: To address the issue of duplicate HTML anchors, the logic for generating anchors should be reviewed to ensure that each section, including the "Symbols" section, has a unique anchor. This could involve appending a unique identifier to sections with the same name or ensuring that the "Symbols" section is only created once.

3. **Unit Tests**: Modify existing unit tests or add new ones to cover the scenarios described in the issue, ensuring that entries starting with symbols like "_@_", "_£_", and "_←_" are grouped under a single "Symbols" section and that the HTML anchors for these sections are unique.

Without direct access to the specific parts of the code responsible for these behaviors, these steps outline a high-level approach to diagnosing and resolving the issue based on the information provided and standard practices for handling index categorization and HTML generation in documentation projects.
