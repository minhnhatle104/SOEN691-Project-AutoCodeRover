Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct and specific code patch cannot be accurately formulated without access to the actual implementation details of the index generation and categorization logic within the Sphinx project. The issue description and the test method `test_create_single_index` from `tests/test_environment_indexentries.py` provide insights into the expected behavior and the nature of the problem, but they do not offer direct access to the implementation that needs modification.

Therefore, without the ability to propose a specific code patch that matches the original program's structure and logic, the best course of action is to outline a conceptual approach to resolving the issue, which can guide further investigation and modification by someone with access to the full codebase:

1. **Identify the Index Generation Logic**: Locate the part of the Sphinx codebase responsible for generating the index entries from the source documentation. This may involve parsing documentation files, extracting index directives, and categorizing them.

2. **Review Symbol Handling**: Within the index generation logic, review how symbols are detected and categorized. The goal is to ensure that all symbols are treated uniformly, regardless of their Unicode or ASCII nature. This may involve adjusting the logic that determines the first character of an index entry and decides whether it should be categorized under "Symbols" or under alphabetical sections.

3. **Consolidate Symbol Entries**: Ensure that all symbol entries are consolidated into a single "Symbols" section in the index. This may require adjusting the sorting or grouping logic to treat all non-alphabetical characters as belonging to the same category.

4. **Adjust HTML Anchor Generation**: To address the issue of duplicate HTML anchors for the "Symbols" sections, ensure that the logic for generating HTML anchors produces unique identifiers for each section. If the "Symbols" section is indeed consolidated into one, this should naturally resolve the issue of duplicate anchors.

5. **Update or Add Unit Tests**: Based on the changes made, update existing unit tests (like `test_create_single_index`) or add new ones to cover the scenarios described in the issue. This includes testing for the correct categorization of symbol entries and the uniqueness of HTML anchors for index sections.

While this approach does not provide a direct code patch, it outlines the steps necessary to investigate and potentially resolve the issue within the Sphinx project. It is recommended that these steps be taken by a developer with access to the full codebase and the ability to test changes in the context of the project's existing infrastructure and testing frameworks.
