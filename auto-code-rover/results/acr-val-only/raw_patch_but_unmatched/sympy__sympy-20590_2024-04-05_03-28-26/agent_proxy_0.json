            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand the implementation details of the `Symbol` class in the Sympy library, specifically how it transitioned from version 1.6.2 to 1.7 in terms of handling the `__dict__` attribute and `__slots__`. The issue suggests that the behavior of the `Symbol` instances regarding the `__dict__` attribute has changed, possibly due to changes in the class definition or its parent classes. To gather the necessary information, we should:\n\n1. Look into the `Symbol` class definition to see if `__slots__` is defined and how it's being used.\n2. Check if any parent class of `Symbol` has changed its implementation regarding `__slots__` or `__dict__` between the two versions.\n\nGiven the above, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n- `search_class(\"Symbol\")`: This will help us find the file and location where the `Symbol` class is defined.\n- `search_code(\"__slots__\")`: Since the issue mentions `__slots__`, searching for this keyword across the codebase might reveal relevant changes or usage patterns in `Symbol` or its parent classes.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue."
