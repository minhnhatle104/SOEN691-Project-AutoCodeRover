Given the issue described and the context retrieved, the problem seems to revolve around the unexpected presence of a `__dict__` attribute in `Symbol` instances starting from Sympy version 1.7, which suggests a deviation from the intended behavior when `__slots__` is defined. Since `Symbol` instances are not expected to have a `__dict__` due to the explicit definition of `__slots__`, this behavior might be unintended and could be due to inheritance or changes in the class structure that inadvertently introduced `__dict__`.

Without direct access to the specific changes made between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7, a hypothetical patch would aim to ensure that `Symbol` and its parent classes strictly adhere to the `__slots__` definition, preventing the creation of `__dict__`. Here's a speculative approach based on the general Python behavior regarding `__slots__` and class inheritance:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/symbol.py</file>
<original>
class Symbol(AtomicExpr, Boolean):
    __slots__ = ('name',)
</original>
<patched>
class Symbol(AtomicExpr, Boolean):
    __slots__ = ('name',)  # Ensure no additional attributes are added
    def __init__(self, name, **assumptions):
        self.name = name
        super().__init__(**assumptions)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/core/basic.py</file>
<original>
class Basic(Printable, metaclass=ManagedProperties):
    __slots__ = ('_mhash', '_args', '_assumptions')
</original>
<patched>
class Basic(Printable, metaclass=ManagedProperties):
    __slots__ = ('_mhash', '_args', '_assumptions')  # No change needed here, but ensuring consistency in the inheritance chain
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/core/expr.py</file>
<original>
class Expr(Basic, EvalfMixin):
    __slots__ = ()
</original>
<patched>
class Expr(Basic, EvalfMixin):
    __slots__ = ()  # Confirming no additional slots are introduced in this parent class
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are speculative and based on the assumption that the issue lies in the handling of `__slots__` and inheritance. In reality, resolving this issue would likely require a thorough review of the changes introduced between Sympy versions 1.6.2 and 1.7, including any modifications to class definitions, metaclass usage, or other mechanisms that could affect instance attribute management.
