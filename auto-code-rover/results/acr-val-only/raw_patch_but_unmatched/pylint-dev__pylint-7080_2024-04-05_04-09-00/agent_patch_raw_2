Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without more detailed insight into the implementation of the file discovery and filtering process that respects the `ignore-paths` option during recursive linting. However, based on the conceptual understanding of the issue, I can suggest a general approach that could be taken to address the problem, acknowledging that a precise implementation would require access to and modification of the actual codebase.

The issue seems to stem from the recursive discovery process not properly filtering out directories and files specified in the `ignore-paths` configuration. Ideally, the solution would involve ensuring that the logic responsible for file discovery during recursive linting respects the `ignore-paths` settings.

Since I cannot provide a direct code patch without seeing the implementation of the recursive discovery and linting logic, below is a conceptual approach to what the patch might need to address:

### Conceptual Patch Approach

1. **Enhance File Discovery Logic to Respect `ignore-paths`:**
   The function responsible for discovering files to lint recursively should be enhanced to filter out any files or directories that match the patterns specified in the `ignore-paths` option. This might involve applying the regex patterns from `ignore-paths` to each discovered file or directory path and excluding those that match.

2. **Integration with `ignore-paths` in Recursive Linting:**
   Ensure that the `ignore-paths` configuration is correctly parsed and available to the file discovery logic in a format that can be efficiently applied (e.g., compiled regex objects if not already done).

3. **Automated Test to Verify `ignore-paths` Functionality:**
   Enhance or add automated tests, similar to the `test_recursive_ignore` function, to verify that the `ignore-paths` functionality works as expected with the `--recursive=y` option. This test should cover various scenarios, including nested directories and different path patterns, to ensure robustness.

### Hypothetical Patch Example (Conceptual)

```python
# Assuming a function exists that performs file discovery for recursive linting
def discover_files_recursively(base_directory, ignore_patterns):
    discovered_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(base_directory):
        # Filter out directories that match ignore_patterns
        dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if not matches_ignore_patterns(os.path.join(root, d), ignore_patterns)]
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            if not matches_ignore_patterns(file_path, ignore_patterns):
                discovered_files.append(file_path)
    return discovered_files

def matches_ignore_patterns(file_path, ignore_patterns):
    # This function checks if the given file_path matches any of the ignore_patterns
    return any(pattern.match(file_path) for pattern in ignore_patterns)
```

This conceptual approach outlines the general idea of how to ensure that `ignore-paths` is respected during recursive linting. Implementing this solution would require access to the specific parts of the codebase where file discovery and filtering are handled for recursive linting operations.
