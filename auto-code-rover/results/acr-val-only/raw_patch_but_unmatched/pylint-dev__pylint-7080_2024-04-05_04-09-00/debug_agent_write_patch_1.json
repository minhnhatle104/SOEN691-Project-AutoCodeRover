It's a good starting point to understand how `ignore-paths` is defined and potentially how it's expected to be used.\n- **pylint/utils/utils.py**: Utility functions or classes that might be handling or utilizing the `ignore-paths` option could be defined here. This could include logic for filtering paths.\n- **tests/**: The various files under tests (test_self.py, config/unittest_config.py, lint/unittest_lint.py, lint/unittest_expand_modules.py) likely contain unit tests that reference or test the functionality of `ignore-paths`. These can provide insights into expected behaviors and use cases.\n\n### For `--recursive`:\n- **tests/test_self.py** and **tests/lint/unittest_lint.py**: These files contain tests that reference the `--recursive` option. While these are test files and not the implementation itself, the way `--recursive` is tested can offer clues about its intended behavior and interaction with other options like `ignore-paths`.\n\nGiven this context, to further understand the issue and potentially identify the cause and solution, we should look into how `ignore-paths` is defined and handled, especially in relation to the `--recursive` option. Specifically, we want to see if there's logic that should be filtering out paths specified in `ignore-paths` when running recursively but isn't doing so correctly.\n\nTo proceed, we should examine the implementation details in the following files:\n- **pylint/lint/base_options.py**: For the definition and handling of `ignore-paths`.\n- **pylint/utils/utils.py**: For utility functions or logic related to path filtering.\n\nAdditionally, reviewing the tests related to these options might provide insights into any discrepancies between expected and actual behaviors.\n\nNext steps could involve:\n1. Reviewing the code in **pylint/lint/base_options.py** and **pylint/utils/utils.py** to understand how `ignore-paths` is supposed to work.\n2. Checking if there's a clear integration between the `ignore-paths` and `--recursive` options that might be malfunctioning or if there's an oversight in the implementation.\n3.

Let's analyze the context provided by each search result:\n\n### pylint/lint/base_options.py\n- **Function**: `_make_linter_options`\n- **Code Snippet**: The `ignore-paths` option is defined with a type of `regexp_paths_csv`, indicating that it expects a comma-separated list of regular expression paths.\n\nThis definition in `base_options.py` suggests that `ignore-paths` is designed to accept regular expressions for paths that should be ignored by Pylint. The type `regexp_paths_csv` implies that multiple paths can be specified and that they should be treated as regular expressions. This is a crucial piece of information for understanding how paths are intended to be filtered out.\n\n### pylint/utils/utils.py\n- **Code Snippet**: The `ignore-paths` option is listed among other global option patterns, specifically within a list named `GLOBAL_OPTION_PATTERN_LIST`.\n\nThis mention in `utils.py` indicates that `ignore-paths` is recognized as a global option that affects Pylint's behavior across the board. However, the snippet does not provide details on how `ignore-paths` is processed or applied.\n\n### tests/lint/unittest_lint.py\n- **Function**: `test_recursive_ignore`\n- **Code Snippet**: This test case uses the `--recursive` option set to \"y\" and an unspecified `ignore_parameter`.\n\nThe existence of a test named `test_recursive_ignore` directly points to functionality intended to test the interaction between recursive linting and ignoring specific paths. This suggests that there should be a mechanism in place to ensure that paths specified in `ignore-paths` are indeed ignored when linting recursively. The fact that this test exists implies that there was an intention to support this feature, but the issue reported indicates that it might not be working as expected.\n\n### Analysis Summary\nThe issue seems to revolve around the interaction between the `--recursive=y` option and the `ignore-paths` setting. From the snippets, we know that `ignore-paths` is defined to accept regular expressions for paths to ignore and is recognized as a global option. The test case in `unittest_lint.py` suggests that there is an expectation for these ignored paths to be respected during recursive linting.\n\nGiven this information, the bug might lie in how the `ignore-paths` option is processed during recursive linting operations. It's possible that when linting recursively, the mechanism that filters out ignored paths based on the `ignore-paths` setting is not being correctly applied or is being bypassed.\n\nTo further investigate and potentially resolve the issue, one would need to examine:\n- How the `ignore-paths` option is parsed and stored.\n- How recursive linting is implemented and how it interacts with the list of paths to lint.\n- The logic used to filter out ignored paths during the linting process, especially in the context of recursive linting.\n\nA closer look at the implementation of recursive linting and the application of the `ignore-paths` option in the context of recursive linting (potentially in the code that handles the linting process itself) would be necessary to identify the exact cause of the issue and to develop a fix."

However, without the ability to directly invoke more search API calls here, I recommend looking into the following areas in the codebase:\n\n1. How the `ignore-paths` option is processed and applied during the file selection phase for linting. This might involve searching for functions or methods that handle file selection or filtering based on linting options.\n2.

        "content": "Based on the provided context, it seems the issue might be related to how the `ignore-paths` option is being processed during the recursive file discovery and linting process. The `ignore-paths` option is correctly defined in `pylint/lint/base_options.py`, but the problem might lie in how the recursive discovery process in `tests/lint/unittest_lint.py` handles this option. Specifically, the test case `test_recursive_ignore` suggests that files in ignored paths should not be included in the linting process, yet the issue indicates that they are.\n\nGiven this, a potential patch could involve ensuring that the `ignore-paths` option is correctly applied during the recursive discovery of files to lint. However, without direct access to the function that implements the recursive discovery and linting logic, I'll propose a conceptual patch based on the test case provided in `tests/lint/unittest_lint.py` and the definition of `ignore-paths` in `pylint/lint/base_options.py`.\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>pylint/lint/base_options.py</file>\n<original>...</original>\n<patched>...</patched>\n```\nThis file does not need modification based on the provided context. The definition of `ignore-paths` appears to be correct.\n\n# modification 2\n```python\n<file>tests/lint/unittest_lint.py</file>\n<original>def test_recursive_ignore(ignore_parameter, ignore_parameter_value) -> None:\n    run = Run(\n        [\n            \"--recursive\",\n            \"y\",\n            ignore_parameter,\n            ignore_parameter_value,\n            join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, \"directory\"),\n        ],\n        exit=False,\n    )\n\n    linted_files = run.linter._iterate_file_descrs(\n        tuple(run.linter._discover_files([join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, \"directory\")]))\n    )\n    linted_file_paths = [file_item.filepath for file_item in linted_files]\n\n    ignored_file = os.path.abspath(\n        join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, \"directory\", \"ignored_subdirectory\", \"failing.py\")\n    )\n    assert ignored_file not in linted_file_paths\n\n    for regrtest_data_module in (\n        (\"directory\", \"subdirectory\", \"subsubdirectory\", \"module.py\"),\n        (\"directory\", \"subdirectory\", \"module.py\"),\n        (\"directory\", \"package\", \"module.py\"),\n        (\"directory\", \"package\", \"subpackage\", \"module.py\"),\n    ):\n        module = os.path.abspath(join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, *regrtest_data_module))\n    assert module in linted_file_paths</original>\n<patched>Since the original test case seems to correctly assert that ignored files are not included, the issue likely lies in the implementation of the recursive discovery logic, which is not directly shown. A conceptual patch would involve modifying the recursive discovery logic to properly filter out paths that match the patterns specified in the `ignore-paths` option.\n\nHowever, without the specific implementation details of the recursive discovery logic, I cannot provide a direct code patch. The fix would involve ensuring that `ignore-paths` is considered when collecting files for linting in the recursive discovery process.</patched>\n```\n\nGiven the limitations of the provided context, the exact location and implementation of the fix in the codebase cannot be determined without further details on how the recursive discovery and linting process is implemented. The patch would need to ensure that the `ignore-paths` option is properly applied to exclude specified paths from being linted when the `--recursive=y` option is used."
