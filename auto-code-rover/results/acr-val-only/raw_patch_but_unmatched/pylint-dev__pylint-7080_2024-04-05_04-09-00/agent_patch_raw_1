Based on the provided context, it seems the issue might be related to how the `ignore-paths` option is being processed during the recursive file discovery and linting process. The `ignore-paths` option is correctly defined in `pylint/lint/base_options.py`, but the problem might lie in how the recursive discovery process in `tests/lint/unittest_lint.py` handles this option. Specifically, the test case `test_recursive_ignore` suggests that files in ignored paths should not be included in the linting process, yet the issue indicates that they are.

Given this, a potential patch could involve ensuring that the `ignore-paths` option is correctly applied during the recursive discovery of files to lint. However, without direct access to the function that implements the recursive discovery and linting logic, I'll propose a conceptual patch based on the test case provided in `tests/lint/unittest_lint.py` and the definition of `ignore-paths` in `pylint/lint/base_options.py`.

This file does not need modification based on the provided context. The definition of `ignore-paths` appears to be correct.

# modification 2

<original>def test_recursive_ignore(ignore_parameter, ignore_parameter_value) -> None:
    run = Run(
        [
            "--recursive",
            "y",
            ignore_parameter,
            ignore_parameter_value,
            join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, "directory"),
        ],
        exit=False,
    )

    linted_files = run.linter._iterate_file_descrs(
        tuple(run.linter._discover_files([join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, "directory")]))
    )
    linted_file_paths = [file_item.filepath for file_item in linted_files]

    ignored_file = os.path.abspath(
        join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, "directory", "ignored_subdirectory", "failing.py")
    )
    assert ignored_file not in linted_file_paths

    for regrtest_data_module in (
        ("directory", "subdirectory", "subsubdirectory", "module.py"),
        ("directory", "subdirectory", "module.py"),
        ("directory", "package", "module.py"),
        ("directory", "package", "subpackage", "module.py"),
    ):
        module = os.path.abspath(join(REGRTEST_DATA_DIR, *regrtest_data_module))
    assert module in linted_file_paths</original>
<patched>Since the original test case seems to correctly assert that ignored files are not included, the issue likely lies in the implementation of the recursive discovery logic, which is not directly shown. A conceptual patch would involve modifying the recursive discovery logic to properly filter out paths that match the patterns specified in the `ignore-paths` option.

However, without the specific implementation details of the recursive discovery logic, I cannot provide a direct code patch. The fix would involve ensuring that `ignore-paths` is considered when collecting files for linting in the recursive discovery process.</patched>
```

Given the limitations of the provided context, the exact location and implementation of the fix in the codebase cannot be determined without further details on how the recursive discovery and linting process is implemented. The patch would need to ensure that the `ignore-paths` option is properly applied to exclude specified paths from being linted when the `--recursive=y` option is used.
