Given the information from the issue description and the constraints of this interaction, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on the understanding that the sequence of migration operations needs adjustment. Since I don't have access to the actual file paths or the exact codebase, I'll use placeholders where specific details are required. This patch assumes that the issue is with the ordering of migration operations in a Django migrations file.

```python
<file>migrations/000x_auto_....py</file>
<original>
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),
),
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['created_at'], name='look_image_created_f746cf_idx'),
),
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['updated_at'], name='look_image_updated_aceaf9_idx'),
),
migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
    name='lookimage',
    order_with_respect_to='look',
),
</original>
<patched>
migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
    name='lookimage',
    order_with_respect_to='look',
),
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),
),
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['created_at'], name='look_image_created_f746cf_idx'),
),
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['updated_at'], name='look_image_updated_aceaf9_idx'),
),
</patched>
```

This modification assumes the issue is due to the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation being placed after the `AddIndex` operations, which include the `_order` field. The patch reorders these operations so that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` comes first, ensuring the `_order` field is properly established before any indexes involving it are created.

Please replace the placeholders with the actual file path and adjust the migration identifiers (`000x_auto_....py`) as per your project's migration files. This example is based on the understanding that adjusting the sequence of operations will resolve the issue described.
