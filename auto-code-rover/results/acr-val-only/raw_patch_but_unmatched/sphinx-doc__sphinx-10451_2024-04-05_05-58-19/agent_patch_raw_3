Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it's clear that providing a direct patch without access to the actual source code or specific implementation details is challenging. The issue described involves the Sphinx documentation tool, specifically the autodoc extension, and how it handles `*args` and `**kwargs` with the setting `autodoc_typehints = "description"`. 

Without the ability to directly view or interact with the source code, any attempt to craft a precise patch would be speculative. However, the goal of addressing the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the generated documentation is clear. A general approach to solving this issue would involve ensuring that the documentation generation process correctly interprets and renders these special parameters without duplication.

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would likely involve:

1. Identifying the part of the code responsible for parsing function signatures and extracting parameter information, including type hints.
2. Implementing a check to ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are only documented once, possibly by refining how type hints and parameter descriptions are merged into the final documentation output.
3. Testing the changes with a variety of functions to ensure that the documentation is generated correctly and that no other features are negatively impacted.

Developers working on the Sphinx project or those familiar with its codebase would need to review the relevant modules—potentially those within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` package—to identify the exact location of the bug and to implement a fix.

I apologize for any confusion and hope this explanation provides a clearer understanding of the steps that could be taken to address the issue, despite the inability to offer a direct code patch.
