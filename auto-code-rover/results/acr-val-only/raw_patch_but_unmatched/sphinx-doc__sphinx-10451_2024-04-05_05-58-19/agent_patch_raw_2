Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the Sphinx autodoc extension, it's challenging to provide an exact patch that matches the original program. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to address the issue of duplicated `*args` and `**kwargs` in the documentation generated by Sphinx when `autodoc_typehints = "description"` is set.

The issue likely stems from the way Sphinx autodoc processes and renders type hints for function signatures, particularly for variadic parameters (`*args` and `**kwargs`). A potential solution involves modifying the logic that Sphinx uses to parse and document function signatures to ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled correctly and without duplication.

Since I cannot provide a patch that directly matches the original program, I recommend the following steps for developers working on the Sphinx project:

1. **Review the Function Signature Processing**: Start by examining the code responsible for parsing and documenting function signatures in the autodoc extension. This might involve looking at how docstrings are parsed, how type hints are extracted, and how the final documentation is generated.

2. **Identify Duplication Logic**: Look for any logic that might lead to the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the generated documentation. This could be related to how variadic parameters are handled or how type hints are merged with existing docstring content.

3. **Implement a Filtering Mechanism**: Before finalizing the documentation output, implement a filtering mechanism to check for and remove any duplicated entries for `*args` and `**kwargs`. Ensure that this mechanism respects the intended documentation structure and does not remove necessary information.

4. **Test the Changes**: After making the necessary modifications, thoroughly test the changes with a variety of function signatures to ensure that the issue is resolved and that no other documentation content is adversely affected.

While I cannot provide a specific code patch, I hope these conceptual steps offer a starting point for addressing the issue within the Sphinx autodoc extension. Developers with access to the Sphinx codebase and a deeper understanding of its architecture will be better positioned to implement an effective solution.
