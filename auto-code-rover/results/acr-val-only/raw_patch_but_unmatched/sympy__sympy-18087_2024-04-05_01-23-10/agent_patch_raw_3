Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears a direct and specific patch cannot be provided without further context or access to modify the code directly. The issue described involves complex trigonometric simplification, which requires careful handling within the `trigsimp` function to ensure accuracy without unintended side effects. 

In a real-world scenario, addressing this issue would likely involve a detailed review of the `trigsimp` function's handling of complex numbers and trigonometric identities, followed by targeted testing to ensure that any changes do not adversely affect other functionalities. 

Without the ability to directly apply a patch in this format, the best course of action would be to propose a conceptual approach to the problem:

1. **Enhance Handling of Complex Numbers**: Modify the `trigsimp` function to better recognize and handle expressions involving complex numbers, especially when simplifying expressions like `sqrt(sin(x)**2)`.

2. **Review Simplification Methods**: Examine the specific methods (`'matching'`, `'groebner'`, `'combined'`, and `'fu'`) used by `trigsimp` to identify where the incorrect simplification might be occurring and implement checks or corrections as needed.

3. **Implement Special Cases**: Introduce logic to specifically address known problematic cases, such as the one described in the issue, ensuring that simplifications involving complex numbers are handled correctly.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: After modifications, conduct thorough testing with both real and complex expressions to ensure that the issue is resolved without introducing new problems.

This conceptual approach highlights the steps needed to address the issue within the `trigsimp` function, emphasizing careful modification and testing to ensure accuracy and reliability in symbolic simplification.
