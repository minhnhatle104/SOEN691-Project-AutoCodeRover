Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem might not be with the `add_marker` method itself but rather with how the dynamically added `xfail` markers are processed during the test run. The issue described indicates that dynamically added `xfail` markers no longer cause tests to be treated as expected failures in pytest 6.0.0rc1, unlike in previous versions.

The provided code snippets do not directly show a bug or an obvious change that would cause the described issue. However, a common approach to address issues related to changes in behavior between versions is to ensure that newly introduced or modified logic maintains compatibility with existing functionalities, especially for dynamic features like adding markers at runtime.

Without specific details on what changed between pytest 5.4.3 and 6.0.0rc1 regarding marker processing, a hypothetical patch might involve ensuring that dynamically added `xfail` markers are correctly recognized and processed in the test lifecycle, particularly in the `evaluate_xfail_marks` and related methods in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`.

Since we cannot pinpoint a specific line or block of code that introduced the issue based on the provided context, I will outline a general approach that could be taken to investigate and potentially address the issue:

# Hypothetical modification to ensure dynamically added xfail markers are processed correctly
```python
<file>src/_pytest/skipping.py</file>
<original>
def evaluate_xfail_marks(item: Item) -> Optional[Xfail]:
    """Evaluate xfail marks on item, returning Xfail if triggered."""
    for mark in item.iter_markers(name="xfail"):
        ...
</original>
<patched>
def evaluate_xfail_marks(item: Item) -> Optional[Xfail]:
    """Evaluate xfail marks on item, returning Xfail if triggered, including dynamically added markers."""
    # Ensure dynamically added markers are also evaluated
    dynamic_markers = getattr(item, 'dynamic_xfail_markers', [])
    for mark in list(item.iter_markers(name="xfail")) + dynamic_markers:
        ...
</patched>
```

This hypothetical modification suggests a mechanism to ensure that dynamically added `xfail` markers are included in the evaluation process. It introduces a `dynamic_markers` list that would need to be populated elsewhere in the codebase when markers are added dynamically (not shown here because the mechanism for adding dynamic markers is not the focus of the issue).

Please note, this modification is speculative and intended to illustrate a potential approach to debugging and fixing the issue based on the described problem and the provided context. Actual resolution might require a deeper investigation into the pytest codebase, specifically examining changes made around marker processing between versions 5.4.3 and 6.0.0rc1.
