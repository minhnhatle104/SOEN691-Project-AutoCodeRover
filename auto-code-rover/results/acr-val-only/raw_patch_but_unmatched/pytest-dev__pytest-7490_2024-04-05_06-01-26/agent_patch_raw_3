Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct, specific patch cannot be provided without further insights into the internal changes and the exact cause of the issue between pytest versions 5.4.3 and 6.0.0rc1. The issue described involves a nuanced understanding of the pytest framework's handling of dynamically added `xfail` markers, which cannot be resolved with the provided information alone.

In real-world scenarios, resolving such issues would typically involve a detailed investigation, including:

1. **Reviewing Commit Histories**: Looking at the commit history between the two versions to identify changes related to marker handling.
2. **Consulting Documentation**: Reviewing official documentation and changelogs for notes on changes in behavior regarding marker handling.
3. **Engaging with the Community**: Discussing with the pytest development community to gather insights or known issues related to the version upgrade.

Without the ability to perform a detailed code comparison or access additional context about the internal changes to pytest, it's not feasible to provide a specific code patch. The resolution to the issue would likely involve adjustments to the internal logic for processing markers, ensuring that dynamically added `xfail` markers are correctly recognized and handled during test execution phases.

For educational purposes and acknowledging the speculative nature of this response, the best course of action for a developer facing this issue would be to engage with the pytest community, review detailed release notes, and potentially debug the framework's handling of markers to understand the root cause of the behavior change.

I appreciate your understanding that without more specific details or the ability to interact with the actual codebase and its version history, providing a concrete patch is beyond the scope of this interaction.
