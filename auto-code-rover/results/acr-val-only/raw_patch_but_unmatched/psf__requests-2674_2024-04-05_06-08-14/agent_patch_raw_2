Given the constraints and the nature of this interaction, I provided a hypothetical solution based on a general understanding of the issue with `urllib3` exceptions not being properly wrapped by the `requests` library. Unfortunately, without access to the actual source code and specific code snippets that need to be patched, creating an exact match for the original program is challenging.

However, the conceptual approach to solving the issue remains valid: identifying where `urllib3` exceptions are caught in the `requests` library and ensuring they are wrapped into `requests`-specific exceptions to maintain the abstraction layer. This involves modifying the exception handling logic to catch `urllib3` exceptions and raise the corresponding `requests` exceptions instead.

Since I cannot provide a patch that directly matches the original program's code, I recommend reviewing the `requests` library's exception handling logic, particularly in `requests/adapters.py`, to apply a similar logic as outlined in the hypothetical patch. Look for places where `urllib3` exceptions are directly raised or propagated and modify those to wrap the exceptions as needed.

For anyone working on this issue within a real project, closely examining the exception handling patterns and ensuring consistency in how exceptions from `urllib3` are managed within the `requests` library would be the way forward.
