Given the context of the issue with `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API and not being properly wrapped, I'll provide a hypothetical patch. This patch aims to ensure that `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` are caught and wrapped into `requests`-specific exceptions. Since I don't have access to the actual source code of the `requests` library here, the patch will be based on a general understanding of how such an issue might be addressed.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase of the `requests` library.

# modification 1
```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>
import urllib3.exceptions
</original>
<patched>
import urllib3.exceptions
from requests.exceptions import RequestException, Timeout, DecodeError
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>
except urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError as e:
    raise
</original>
<patched>
except urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError as e:
    raise Timeout(e, request=request)
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>
except urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError as e:
    raise
</original>
<patched>
except urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError as e:
    raise DecodeError(e, request=request)
</patched>
```

In these modifications:
- **Modification 1** updates the import section to include the specific `requests` exceptions (`Timeout` and `DecodeError`) that should be used to wrap the corresponding `urllib3` exceptions.
- **Modification 2** and **Modification 3** replace the generic `raise` statements for `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` and `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`, respectively, with raises of the corresponding `requests` exceptions (`Timeout` and `DecodeError`). This ensures that these `urllib3` exceptions are properly wrapped into the `requests` exception hierarchy, providing a consistent interface for handling errors.

Remember, before applying any patch, thorough testing is necessary to ensure compatibility and that the patch addresses the issue without introducing new problems.
