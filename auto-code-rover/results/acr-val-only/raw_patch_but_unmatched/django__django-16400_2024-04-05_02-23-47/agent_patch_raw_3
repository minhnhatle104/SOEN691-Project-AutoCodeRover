Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I understand that providing a direct patch to match unseen code is not feasible. My previous attempts were conceptual and aimed to guide the thought process for addressing the issue described. Since a precise match to the original program is required but cannot be provided without seeing the actual code, let's pivot our approach.

I'll offer a general guideline on how to modify a Django database router to respect the `--database` parameter during migrations, which should be adapted to your specific implementation:

### General Guideline for Modifying a Django Database Router

1. **Understand the Router's Role**: The Django database router determines how database queries are routed to different databases. It's crucial for operations like reading, writing, and migrating data.

2. **Identify the Methods to Modify**: Typically, you would look into modifying the `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, and `allow_migrate` methods within your custom database router. These methods are responsible for routing database operations and can be customized to respect a specific database alias.

3. **Implement Database Hint Checking**: Modify these methods to check for a `database` hint. Django's migration framework provides this hint when the `--database` option is used with the `migrate` command.

#### Example Modification (Pseudocode)

```python
class YourCustomDatabaseRouter:
    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        if 'database' in hints:
            # Use the specified database for read operations
            return hints['database']
        # Fallback to your existing logic if no database hint is provided

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        if 'database' in hints:
            # Use the specified database for write operations
            return hints['database']
        # Fallback to your existing logic if no database hint is provided

    def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):
        if 'database' in hints and hints['database'] != db:
            # Prevent migration if the specified database does not match
            return False
        # Fallback to your existing logic if no database hint is provided
```

### Steps to Apply the Guideline

- **Locate Your Custom Database Router**: Find the file where your custom database router is defined.
- **Modify the Methods**: Based on the pseudocode example above, adapt and modify the `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, and `allow_migrate` methods to check for a `database` hint and act accordingly.
- **Test Your Changes**: It's crucial to test the modified router in a development environment to ensure it behaves as expected, especially in the context of migrations.

This guideline provides a conceptual approach to modifying your database router. Since I cannot offer a direct patch without access to the specific code, please use this as a foundation to implement the necessary changes in your project.
