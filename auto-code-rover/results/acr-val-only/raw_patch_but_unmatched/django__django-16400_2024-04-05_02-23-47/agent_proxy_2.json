However, without specific leads on the custom implementations, constructing targeted search API calls is challenging. Instead, a broader approach could be beneficial:\n\n1. `search_code(\"Tenant\")`: This could help identify any code related to the multi-tenancy logic, potentially uncovering the custom database router or middleware.\n\n2. `search_code(\"subdomain\")`: Since the middleware is expected to handle subdomains, searching for this keyword might reveal how the request's subdomain is processed or linked to database routing.\n\nThese searches aim to find any references related to the multi-tenancy setup that might not have been captured by the initial, more specific queries.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\nWithout direct references to the specific files or methods involved in the issue, we do not have enough information to accurately identify the bug locations. Further context obtained through broader search parameters or manual review of the project's multi-tenancy implementation might be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the bug."
