Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the original implementation of the custom database router and middleware, it's challenging to provide a precise patch that matches the original program. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to what such a patch might look like, focusing on the general logic that should be implemented to respect the database parameter during migrations. This approach is based on the assumption that the custom database router does not currently handle the `hints` parameter correctly to respect the `--database` option during migrations.

Since I cannot match the original program's exact code, the following is a conceptual illustration of how the patch could be structured. This should be adapted to fit the actual code and logic of your project's custom database router.

### Conceptual Patch

The goal is to modify the custom database router to ensure it respects the `database` hint provided during migrations. This involves checking for a `database` hint in the `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, and `allow_migrate` methods and adjusting the logic accordingly.

#### Conceptual Modification for `db_for_read` and `db_for_write` Methods

```python
# Assuming this is the structure of your methods before the patch
def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
    # Original logic to determine the database for read operations

def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
    # Original logic to determine the database for write operations

# Conceptual patch
def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
    if 'database' in hints:
        return hints['database']
    # Adjusted logic to respect the 'database' hint

def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
    if 'database' in hints:
        return hints['database']
    # Adjusted logic to respect the 'database' hint
```

#### Conceptual Modification for `allow_migrate` Method

```python
# Assuming this is the structure of your method before the patch
def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):
    # Original logic to determine if migration is allowed

# Conceptual patch
def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):
    if 'database' in hints and hints['database'] != db:
        return False
    # Adjusted logic to respect the 'database' hint
```

### Notes

- These modifications are conceptual and need to be adapted to the specific logic and structure of your custom database router.
- The key addition is the check for the `database` hint, which Django's migration framework provides when the `--database` option is used. By respecting this hint, the custom database router can ensure that operations are directed to the correct database during migrations.
- It's crucial to thoroughly test these changes to ensure they do not introduce unintended side effects, especially in a multi-database setup.

This approach aims to provide a starting point for adjusting your custom database router to handle the migration issue described.
