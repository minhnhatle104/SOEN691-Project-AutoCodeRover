            "content": "To address the issue of being unable to pickle a figure with a draggable legend in Matplotlib, we need to understand how the draggable functionality is implemented and how it interacts with the pickling process. Given the information in the issue, we will explore the implementation of the `set_draggable` method and the `pickle.dumps` method as it relates to figures and legends in Matplotlib. We'll also look into the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object mentioned in the error message to understand why it's causing issues with pickling.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to gather necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `set_draggable` method within the `Legend` class to understand how draggable legends are implemented.\n2. Search for any code snippets related to `pickle.dumps` within the context of figures or legends to see if there's a specific implementation or workaround for pickling.\n3. Since the error message mentions `FigureCanvasQTAgg`, it's important to understand its role and why it might be causing issues with pickling. Therefore, we'll search for the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method_in_class(\"set_draggable\", \"Legend\")\nsearch_code(\"pickle.dumps\")\nsearch_class(\"FigureCanvasQTAgg\")\n```"
