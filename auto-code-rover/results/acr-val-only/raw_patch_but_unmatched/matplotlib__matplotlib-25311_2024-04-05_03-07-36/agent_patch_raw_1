Given the complexity of the issue, which involves both the `DraggableLegend` and `FigureCanvasQTAgg` classes, a direct patch to enable pickling of figures with draggable legends might not be straightforward without a deeper understanding of the entire Matplotlib architecture and how it interacts with the Qt backend. However, I can propose a conceptual approach that might guide towards a solution.

The core issue seems to be that the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object, and possibly the `DraggableLegend` object, contain state or references that are not serializable through the standard Python pickling process. A potential workaround could involve implementing custom serialization methods for these objects that manually handle the serialization of their state.

### modification 1
Implementing a custom `__getstate__` method in `DraggableLegend` to allow for custom pickling.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/legend.py</file>
<original>
class DraggableLegend(DraggableOffsetBox):
    def __init__(self, legend, use_blit=False, update="loc"):
        ...
</original>
<patched>
class DraggableLegend(DraggableOffsetBox):
    def __init__(self, legend, use_blit=False, update="loc"):
        ...
    def __getstate__(self):
        state = self.__dict__.copy()
        # Remove the unpicklable entries.
        del state['legend']
        return state

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        self.__dict__.update(state)
        # Restore the unpicklable entries.
        self.legend = None  # Placeholder or method to reinitialize the legend
</patched>
```

### modification 2
For the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class, since the issue is likely related to Qt objects, a similar approach could be taken. However, given the complexity and potential side effects, this modification is more conceptual and would need thorough testing.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qtagg.py</file>
<original>
class FigureCanvasQTAgg(FigureCanvasAgg, FigureCanvasQT):
    ...
</original>
<patched>
class FigureCanvasQTAgg(FigureCanvasAgg, FigureCanvasQT):
    ...
    def __getstate__(self):
        # Serialize only the necessary parts of the state.
        state = super().__getstate__()
        # Exclude Qt-specific or non-serializable parts.
        return state

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        # Restore the state, and reinitialize Qt-specific parts as needed.
        super().__setstate__(state)
        # Reinitialize or recreate Qt-specific attributes.
</patched>
```

### Note:
These modifications are conceptual and aim to illustrate a potential approach to solving the pickling issue. Implementing these changes would require a deep understanding of the Matplotlib and Qt internals, thorough testing, and consideration of potential side effects, especially regarding the restoration of the full state of the objects upon unpickling.
