Given the constraints and the complexity of directly modifying the Matplotlib and Qt classes for serialization, a practical workaround might not involve direct modifications to these classes but rather a higher-level approach to manage the pickling process. Since the direct patch cannot be applied due to the complexity and potential for breaking changes, I'll suggest a conceptual workaround that could be implemented by users of the Matplotlib library to circumvent the issue.

This workaround involves manually handling the state of the draggable legend and the figure canvas before pickling, and reconstructing them after unpickling. This approach requires users to implement custom serialization and deserialization functions for their figures.

### Workaround Concept:

1. **Before Pickling**: Extract and store the state of the draggable legend and any other non-serializable components separately. Remove these components from the figure or temporarily disable their non-serializable features.

2. **Pickling**: Proceed with pickling the figure now that it no longer contains non-serializable components.

3. **After Unpickling**: Reconstruct the previously extracted components and reintegrate them into the figure based on the stored state.

### Example Implementation:

This example does not directly modify the Matplotlib source code but provides a way for users to pickle and unpickle figures with draggable legends.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pickle

# Function to prepare a figure for pickling
def prepare_figure_for_pickling(fig):
    # Placeholder for operations to disable or remove non-serializable components
    # For example, disabling draggable legends
    for ax in fig.axes:
        legend = ax.get_legend()
        if legend:
            # Assuming a method to disable dragging or save its state
            legend.set_draggable(False)
    return fig

# Function to restore the figure after unpickling
def restore_figure_after_unpickling(fig):
    # Placeholder for operations to restore non-serializable components
    # For example, re-enabling draggable legends
    for ax in fig.axes:
        legend = ax.get_legend()
        if legend:
            # Assuming a method to re-enable dragging or restore its state
            legend.set_draggable(True)
    return fig

# Example usage
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.plot([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0], label="Test")
ax.legend().set_draggable(True)

# Prepare the figure for pickling
fig = prepare_figure_for_pickling(fig)

# Pickle the figure
with open('figure.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(fig, f)

# Later on...

# Unpickle the figure
with open('figure.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    fig = pickle.load(f)

# Restore the figure's state
fig = restore_figure_after_unpickling(fig)

plt.show()
```

### Note:
This workaround is conceptual and aims to illustrate a potential approach to managing the pickling issue without direct modifications to the Matplotlib source code. The actual implementation of `prepare_figure_for_pickling` and `restore_figure_after_unpickling` functions would need to be adapted based on the specific requirements and the details of the figure being serialized.
