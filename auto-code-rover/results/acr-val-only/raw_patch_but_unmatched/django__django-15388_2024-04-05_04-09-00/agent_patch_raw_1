Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without specific details on the exact cause of the problem within the Django project's codebase, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices and the nature of the issue involving `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in `settings.py`. This patch assumes the issue might be related to how Django's development server watches for file changes in template directories and how adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` could potentially disrupt this mechanism.

### Hypothetical Patch

Since the development server is not restarting as expected when changes are made after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']`, one possible cause could be the way the development server monitors file changes in directories specified in `TEMPLATES['DIRS']`. If adding `BASE_DIR` introduces a path that is not being monitored correctly, it could prevent the autoreload mechanism from triggering.

#### Modification 1: Ensure `BASE_DIR` is correctly added to `TEMPLATES['DIRS']`

```python
<file>settings.py</file>
<original>
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR],
        ...
    },
]
</original>
<patched>
import os

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        ...
    },
]
</patched>
```

#### Explanation:
This modification ensures that `BASE_DIR` is used to construct a path that specifically targets a `templates` directory within the base directory. This is a more common and safer practice, ensuring that the development server only watches a specific directory for changes rather than the entire project base directory, which could lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.

### Note:
This patch is hypothetical and based on a common configuration practice in Django projects. The actual issue might require a more in-depth investigation into Django's autoreload mechanism and how paths are monitored for changes. If the problem persists, reviewing Django's documentation on the development server and template configuration, consulting with the Django community, or debugging the Django source code related to file change detection and the autoreload process would be advisable steps.
