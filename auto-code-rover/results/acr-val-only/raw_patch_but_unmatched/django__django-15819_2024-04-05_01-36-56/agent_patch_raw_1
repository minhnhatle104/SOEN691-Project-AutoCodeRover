Given the nature of the issue with Django's `inspectdb` command not generating `related_name` for ForeignKey fields to the same model, I'll provide a hypothetical patch. This patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate how one might extend Django's `inspectdb` command to include `related_name` in the generated model fields. Note that actual implementation may vary based on the Django version and project structure.

Since I cannot directly access Django's source code or the specific project files, the file paths and code snippets provided below are based on a typical Django project structure and common practices for extending management commands.

# modification 1
```python
<file>your_app/management/commands/custom_inspectdb.py</file>
<original>
from django.core.management.commands.inspectdb import Command as InspectDBCommand

class Command(InspectDBCommand):
    pass
</original>
<patched>
from django.core.management.commands.inspectdb import Command as InspectDBCommand

class Command(InspectDBCommand):
    def handle_field(self, field_type, field_params, field_notes, table_name, field_name):
        # Original handle_field logic here...
        
        # New logic to add related_name for ForeignKey fields to the same model
        if field_type == 'ForeignKey' and field_params.get('to', '') == table_name:
            field_params['related_name'] = f"{table_name.lower()}_{field_name.lower()}_related"
        
        return super().handle_field(field_type, field_params, field_notes, table_name, field_name)
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a custom management command named `custom_inspectdb` within a Django app (`your_app`). It extends Django's built-in `inspectdb` command. The key change is in the overridden `handle_field` method, where it checks if the field being processed is a ForeignKey pointing to the same model (`field_params.get('to', '') == table_name`). If so, it adds a `related_name` parameter to the field's parameters, using a combination of the table name and field name to generate a unique related name.

Please note, this is a simplified example and might need adjustments based on the actual implementation details of the `inspectdb` command in the Django version you are using. Additionally, this approach assumes familiarity with extending Django management commands and may require further customization to fit into your project seamlessly.
