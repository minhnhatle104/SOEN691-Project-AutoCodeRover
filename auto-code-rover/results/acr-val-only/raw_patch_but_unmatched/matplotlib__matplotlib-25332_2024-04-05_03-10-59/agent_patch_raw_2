Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct modification to the `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` methods might not be straightforward without a deeper understanding of the `self._align_label_groups` mechanism and its implementation. Since the original task was to address the inability to pickle a figure after calling `align_labels()`, and considering the error points to issues with pickling `weakref.ReferenceType` objects, a precise patch cannot be provided without further insight into the internal workings of these methods and the structures they manipulate.

However, a general approach to solving pickling issues with complex objects in Python involves implementing custom pickling behavior via the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods, which was suggested. Since the provided code snippets from the `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` methods do not directly show the use of `weakref.ReferenceType` objects or the exact implementation of `_align_label_groups`, any patch would be speculative.

In real-world scenarios, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the implementation of `_align_label_groups` to understand how it uses weak references.
- Identifying if these weak references are essential for the functionality or if they can be managed differently to be more pickle-friendly.
- If modification of the `FigureBase` class is required, it would involve detailed knowledge of the matplotlib codebase and potentially significant changes that ensure the functionality remains intact while also becoming pickle-friendly.

Without the ability to directly view or modify the internal implementation details of matplotlib's `FigureBase` class and its handling of label alignment, providing a concrete patch is not feasible. Further investigation and collaboration with the matplotlib development team would be necessary to develop a solution that addresses the pickling issue without adversely affecting the library's functionality.
