Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential patch would involve ensuring that the objects involved in the `self._align_label_groups` mechanism are pickleable. Since the error message indicated an issue with `weakref.ReferenceType` objects, the patch should focus on how these references are handled during the pickling process. 

However, without specific details on the implementation of `self._align_label_groups` and how it uses weak references, we can propose a general approach to address the issue. This approach involves implementing custom pickling methods for the `FigureBase` class (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`) to manage the pickling of potentially problematic references.

Here's a hypothetical patch based on the general approach:

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>
class FigureBase:
    ...
</original>
<patched>
import copy

class FigureBase:
    ...
    def __getstate__(self):
        state = self.__dict__.copy()
        # Assuming _align_label_groups contains the problematic references,
        # replace it with a pickle-friendly structure or remove it from the state.
        if '_align_label_groups' in state:
            # Example: Convert the problematic structure to a pickle-friendly format
            # or simply remove it if it's not essential for the figure's state.
            state['_align_label_groups'] = copy.deepcopy(state['_align_label_groups'])
        return state

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        # If _align_label_groups was modified for pickling, restore it to its original form
        if '_align_label_groups' in state:
            # Example: Convert back to the original structure
            # This step depends on how _align_label_groups is implemented and used.
            state['_align_label_groups'] = state['_align_label_groups']
        self.__dict__.update(state)
</patched>
```

This patch is speculative and serves as an example of how one might begin to address the issue. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of how `_align_label_groups` is used and how it can be made pickle-friendly. Adjustments to the patch would be necessary based on the specific details of the implementation and the requirements for preserving the figure's state across the pickling process.
