```

This modification adds a check for undefined expressions (such as `zoo`, `-zoo`, `nan`) after performing substitutions. If an undefined expression is detected, a `ValueError` is raised, alerting the user to the issue. This approach aims to provide clearer feedback when a substitution results in an undefined expression, which is the core issue reported.
