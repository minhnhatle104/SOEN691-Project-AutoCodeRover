Additionally, understanding how expressions are evaluated when a subexpression becomes undefined could be crucial. Let's start by searching for these methods and any relevant code snippets that handle undefined expressions or special cases in substitutions and limits.\n\n- search_method(\"subs\")\n- search_method(\"limit\")\n- search_code(\"undefined expression\")"
