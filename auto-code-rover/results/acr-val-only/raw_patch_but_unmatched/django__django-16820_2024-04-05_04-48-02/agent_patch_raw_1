Given the scenario and the limitations of our interaction, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on the context we've discussed. This patch aims to address the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` in the context of squashing migrations and removing deprecation warnings. Please note, in a real-world scenario, thorough testing and review would be necessary to validate these changes.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/migration.py</file>
<original>
for operation in self.operations:
    ...
    operation.database_forwards(
        self.app_label, schema_editor, old_state, project_state
    )

<patched>
for operation in self.operations:
    ...
    # Check if the operation involves index_together which is deprecated
    if hasattr(operation, 'index_together') and operation.index_together:
        # Convert index_together to Meta.indexes format
        indexes = [models.Index(fields=list(fields)) for fields in operation.index_together]
        operation.options['indexes'] = operation.options.get('indexes', []) + indexes
        del operation.index_together
    operation.database_forwards(
        self.app_label, schema_editor, old_state, project_state
    )
    ...
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py</file>
<original>
def handle(self, *args, **options):
    ...
    # Logic to squash migrations
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def handle(self, *args, **options):
    ...
    # Before squashing, convert any Meta.index_together to Meta.indexes
    for migration in migrations_to_squash:
        if 'index_together' in migration.operations:
            migration.operations = [
                op for op in migration.operations if not isinstance(op, IndexTogetherOperation)
            ] + [
                ConvertIndexTogetherToIndexes(index_together)
                for index_together in migration.operations if isinstance(op, IndexTogetherOperation)
            ]
    ...
</patched>
```

Please note, `ConvertIndexTogetherToIndexes` is a hypothetical operation that you would need to implement, which converts `index_together` definitions into `Meta.indexes` format. This example assumes such an operation could be defined and used to process migrations before squashing.

This patch is illustrative and aims to provide a conceptual direction for addressing the issue. Actual implementation might require additional considerations such as handling edge cases, ensuring compatibility across Django versions, and extensive testing, especially with complex migrations.
