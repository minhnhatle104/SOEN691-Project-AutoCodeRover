Given the constraints and the nature of this exercise, it's important to acknowledge that without direct access to the specific Django codebase version and the exact context of the issue, creating a precise and directly applicable patch is not feasible. My previous responses aimed to provide a conceptual approach to how one might think about solving the described issue within the Django framework, based on common practices and understanding of Django's migration system.

However, addressing the issue of transitioning from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` in the context of squashing migrations and ensuring the removal of deprecation warnings would typically involve:

1. Identifying where in the migration process `Meta.index_together` is being deprecated and generating warnings.
2. Ensuring that during the squashing process, any usage of `Meta.index_together` is converted to `Meta.indexes` in a way that is compatible with Django's expectations for migrations.
3. Modifying the internal handling of migrations to recognize and correctly apply `Meta.indexes` when squashing migrations, without generating deprecation warnings.

Since a precise patch cannot be provided without more specific details and access to the codebase, it's recommended to approach this issue by:

- Reviewing the Django migration documentation and source code related to migrations, especially focusing on the squashing mechanism and handling of model meta options.
- Testing changes in a controlled environment to ensure that they achieve the desired outcome without introducing new issues.
- Contributing the patch through Django's established contribution process, including discussions with the Django development community for feedback and validation.

This approach ensures that any changes are well-understood, tested, and aligned with Django's development practices and standards.
