Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of the task, creating a precise patch without direct access to the specific versions of the files or the exact implementation details in the Django codebase is challenging. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to how one might address the issue of transitioning from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` and removing deprecation warnings during migration squashing. This approach should be adapted and tested according to the actual codebase and Django's implementation details.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

#### Modification 1: Handling `index_together` in Migration Operations
For this modification, the idea is to intercept migration operations that involve `index_together` and convert them to use `Meta.indexes` instead. This is a conceptual approach and might not directly match the Django codebase's structure.

```python
<file>django/db/migrations/migration.py</file>
<original>
# This is a conceptual placeholder. Actual implementation details may vary.
</original>
<patched>
# Conceptual code to illustrate the approach
for operation in self.operations:
    if isinstance(operation, migrations.AlterModelOptions) and 'index_together' in operation.options:
        index_together = operation.options.pop('index_together')
        indexes = [models.Index(fields=fields, name='_'.join(fields) + '_idx') for fields in index_together]
        if 'indexes' in operation.options:
            operation.options['indexes'].extend(indexes)
        else:
            operation.options['indexes'] = indexes
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Updating SquashMigrations Command Logic
This modification aims to update the `squashmigrations` command to ensure it handles the transition from `index_together` to `indexes`. Again, this is a conceptual approach.

```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py</file>
<original>
# This is a conceptual placeholder. Actual implementation details may vary.
</original>
<patched>
# Conceptual code to illustrate the approach
# Assume we have a function to convert index_together to indexes
def convert_index_together_to_indexes(migration):
    for operation in migration.operations:
        if isinstance(operation, migrations.AlterModelOptions) and 'index_together' in operation.options:
            # Conversion logic as described in Modification 1
            ...

# Apply this conversion to all migrations before squashing
for migration in migrations_to_squash:
    convert_index_together_to_indexes(migration)
</patched>
```

### Note
These modifications are conceptual and intended to illustrate a potential approach to solving the described issue. The actual implementation would require access to the Django codebase, understanding of the specific versions involved, and thorough testing to ensure compatibility and correctness. Adjustments to the code might be necessary based on the actual structure and logic of the Django migrations framework.
