Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I understand that providing a patch directly applicable to your specific codebase is challenging without seeing the actual code or file structure. However, based on the issue described, I can offer a general approach to resolving the problem within the Django framework. This approach should be adapted to fit the specifics of your project.

The issue at hand involves ensuring that a `Product` instance has its non-numeric primary key (`sku`) properly set and recognized by an associated `Order` instance before saving. The problem arises because the `Order` instance is being saved before the `Product`'s `sku` is properly assigned, leading to data integrity issues.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch to your code, the following is a conceptual solution that addresses the core problem. You will need to adapt this conceptual solution to your specific models and application logic.

### Conceptual Solution

**Ensure `Product` instance is fully initialized and saved before associating it with an `Order`:**

Before creating and saving an `Order` instance, make sure the `Product` instance it references is fully initialized with its `sku` set and saved. This ensures that the `Product`'s primary key is correctly established in the database before any references are made from `Order` instances.

```python
# Conceptual Python code - adapt as necessary
from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    # Ensure the Product instance is fully initialized with its 'sku'
    product = Product(sku="foo")
    product.save()  # Save the Product instance to the database

    # Now that the Product's 'sku' is set and saved, create the Order
    order = Order(product=product)
    order.save()  # Save the Order instance
```

**Add validation to the `Order` model's save method (optional):**

As an additional safeguard, you can override the `save` method of the `Order` model to check that the associated `Product` instance has a non-empty `sku` before allowing the `Order` to be saved. This step is optional but can help catch issues early in the development process.

```python
# Conceptual Python code for the Order model - adapt as necessary
class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # Other fields...

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.product.sku:
            raise ValueError("Cannot save Order without a Product SKU.")
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

Please adapt these conceptual solutions to fit the specifics of your Django models and application logic. The key is to ensure data integrity by establishing clear dependencies and validations between your `Product` and `Order` instances.
