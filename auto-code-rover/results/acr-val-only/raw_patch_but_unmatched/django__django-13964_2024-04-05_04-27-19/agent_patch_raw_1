Given the nature of the issue described and without direct access to the specific codebase or the ability to execute real-time searches, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common Django practices and the issue's description. The issue revolves around the `Order` model not recognizing the updated primary key (`sku`) of the `Product` model when it's assigned before the `sku` is set. This suggests a problem with the timing of when the `Product` instance's primary key is established in relation to when it's associated with an `Order` instance.

Since we don't have the exact file paths or original code snippets, I'll use placeholders and assume a typical structure for Django models. The patch will focus on ensuring the `Product` instance has its `sku` set before being associated with an `Order` instance.

# modification 1
Ensure `Product` instance has `sku` set before creating `Order` instance.
```python
<file>app/models.py</file>
<original>
with transaction.atomic():
    order = Order()
    order.product = Product()
    order.product.sku = "foo"
    order.product.save()
    order.save()
</original>
<patched>
with transaction.atomic():
    product = Product(sku="foo")
    product.save()
    order = Order(product=product)
    order.save()
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the `Product` instance is fully initialized and saved with its `sku` before it's associated with an `Order`. This approach avoids the issue where the `Order` model might reference an incomplete `Product` instance.

# modification 2
Add validation to `Order` model's save method to check `product.sku`.
```python
<file>app/models.py</file>
<original>
class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</original>
<patched>
class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.product.sku:
            raise ValueError("Product SKU must be set before saving Order.")
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
</patched>
```

This modification adds a safety check to the `Order` model's save method, ensuring that the associated `Product` instance has its `sku` set. This can prevent data integrity issues by avoiding the creation of `Order` instances linked to incomplete `Product` instances.

Please note, these modifications are based on a general understanding of the issue and common Django patterns. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific details of your project's codebase, Django version, and other factors.
