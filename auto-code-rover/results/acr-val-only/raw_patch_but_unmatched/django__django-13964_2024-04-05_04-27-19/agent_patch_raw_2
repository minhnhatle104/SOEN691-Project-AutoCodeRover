Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of the task, without direct access to the specific codebase or details beyond the initial description, I'll provide a conceptual patch that addresses the core issue described. This patch is based on general Django practices and aims to ensure that the `Product` instance's `sku` is set and saved before being associated with an `Order` instance. Please adapt the paths, class names, and logic to fit your actual codebase.

### Conceptual Patch

The issue stems from the `Order` model referencing a `Product` instance before its `sku` (the primary key) is set, leading to inconsistencies. The solution involves ensuring the `Product` instance is fully initialized and persisted with its `sku` before associating it with an `Order`.

#### Modification 1: Ensuring `Product` is saved before creating `Order`

```python
<file>path/to/your/models.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming this is the problematic code pattern:
with transaction.atomic():
    order = Order()
    order.product = Product()
    order.product.sku = "foo"
    order.product.save()
    order.save()
</original>
<patched>
# Revised code to ensure Product is saved before associating with Order:
with transaction.atomic():
    product = Product(sku="foo")
    product.save()  # Ensure product is saved and sku is set before creating the order
    order = Order(product=product)
    order.save()
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Adding validation to ensure `Product`'s `sku` is set before saving `Order`

```python
<file>path/to/your/models.py</file>
<original>
class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</original>
<patched>
class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.product_id or not self.product.sku:
            raise ValueError("Product must have an SKU set before saving an Order.")
        super(Order, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch addresses the issue by ensuring the `Product` instance is correctly initialized and persisted with its `sku` before being used to create an `Order`. Additionally, it introduces a validation step in the `Order` model's save method to prevent saving an `Order` without a properly referenced `Product`.

Please adapt the file paths, class names, and logic to match your actual project structure and requirements.
