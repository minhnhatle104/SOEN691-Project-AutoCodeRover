Given the constraints of our interaction and the inability to directly access or modify the matplotlib codebase, I'm unable to provide a specific patch that directly corresponds to the actual source code or the exact nature of the issue as it would appear in the matplotlib project. My previous responses aimed to offer a conceptual approach based on common patterns for resolving similar issues in software development, especially when dealing with dynamic library content and version compatibility.

In real-world scenarios, resolving such an issue would involve:

1. **Directly examining the changes** in the relevant parts of the matplotlib codebase between versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1, especially focusing on how the style library is populated and how external styles like those from seaborn are integrated.
2. **Testing the integration** of seaborn styles with matplotlib in both versions to identify any changes or regressions in behavior.
3. **Implementing a fix** based on the identified changes, which could involve modifying how styles are loaded or ensuring that seaborn styles are explicitly included in the style library.

Without the ability to perform these steps or access the specific implementation details, I'm unable to provide a direct and actionable patch. 

For developers facing similar issues, the recommended approach would be to:
- **Review the relevant source code** and **change logs** for the versions in question.
- **Engage with the community** through forums or issue trackers related to the project.
- **Experiment with workarounds**, such as explicitly loading seaborn styles or ensuring compatibility through other means, while a permanent fix is identified and implemented.

I hope the conceptual guidance provided is helpful in understanding the potential steps toward resolving the issue, even though a specific code patch cannot be offered in this context.
