Given the constraints of our interaction, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices for resolving issues like the one described. Since I don't have access to the actual source code or the specific changes between matplotlib versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1, this patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the KeyError when accessing "seaborn-colorblind" from `plt.style.library`.

The issue suggests that the "seaborn-colorblind" style is not being correctly registered or is missing in the style library in matplotlib version 3.6.1. A common reason for such issues can be changes in how external styles are loaded or registered between versions.

### Hypothetical Patch

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/style/core.py</file>
<original>
# This is a speculative original code snippet. The actual code might differ.
def load_base_library():
    ...
    # Load the default library
    library.update(load_styles_from_dir(STYLELIB_PATH))
    ...
</original>
<patched>
# This is a speculative patched code snippet. The actual code might differ.
def load_base_library():
    ...
    # Load the default library
    library.update(load_styles_from_dir(STYLELIB_PATH))
    # Attempt to load seaborn styles if seaborn is installed
    try:
        import seaborn
        seaborn_styles = {name: seaborn.axes_style(name) for name in seaborn.palettes.SEABORN_PALETTES}
        library.update(seaborn_styles)
    except ImportError:
        pass
    ...
</patched>
```

### Explanation
This hypothetical patch introduces a try-except block in the function responsible for loading the style library. It attempts to import seaborn and, if successful, loads seaborn styles directly into the matplotlib style library. This approach ensures that seaborn styles are available even if there were changes in how external styles are managed between matplotlib versions.

Please note, this patch is based on a general understanding of how Python libraries might interact and the nature of the reported issue. The actual solution would require a detailed review of the changes in matplotlib's style management system between versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1, as well as an understanding of how seaborn styles are expected to be integrated.
