            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: Yes, to effectively implement the feature request, we need more context about how the units are stored within the `Dataset` objects and how the current representation of datasets is generated, specifically focusing on the inclusion of units in the representation. The following search API calls are necessary to gather this additional context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"formatting.dataset_repr\")`: This will help us understand how the string representation of a `Dataset` is currently generated and where we might integrate units into this representation.\n2. `search_code(\"formatting_html.dataset_repr\")`: This will provide insights into how the HTML representation is generated and where units could be included in the HTML output.\n3. `search_method(\"units\")`: Since the feature request involves showing units, it's crucial to understand if there's a standard method or attribute used across the codebase to access units of data variables and coordinates. This search might reveal how units are stored or accessed within `Dataset` objects.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: Based on the current information, the locations that would need modifications to implement the feature request (not exactly \"buggy\" but target for enhancement) are:\n    - **Buggy files and methods**:\n        - File: `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n            - Method: `__repr__` (This method itself is not buggy but is relevant for the enhancement as it delegates the representation task to `formatting.dataset_repr`.)\n            - Method: `_repr_html_` (Similarly, this method delegates to `formatting_html.dataset_repr` for HTML representation and is a target for enhancement.)\n        - The actual implementation changes will likely be within the functions `formatting.dataset_repr` and `formatting_html.dataset_repr`, once their locations are identified through the proposed search API calls."
