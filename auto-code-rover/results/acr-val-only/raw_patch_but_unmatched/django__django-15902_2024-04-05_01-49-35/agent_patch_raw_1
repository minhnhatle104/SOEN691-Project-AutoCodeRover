Given the context around the "default.html" deprecation warning and the identified locations within the Django project, let's propose a hypothetical patch. This patch aims to address the issue by ensuring that the rendering process for the `ManagementForm` does not inadvertently use a deprecated template or rendering path. Since the exact content of "default.html" and its usage within the rendering process are not detailed, the patch will focus on a conceptual solution based on common practices for addressing deprecation warnings in Django.

Please note, the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific deprecation details, project structure, and Django version.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/renderers.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical example and might not match the actual code.
class SomeRenderer:
    def get_template(self):
        return "default.html"
</original>
<patched>
# Import the appropriate template or define a new one that is not deprecated.
# This is a hypothetical example and might not match the actual code.
class SomeRenderer:
    def get_template(self):
        # Assuming "updated_form_template.html" is the new, non-deprecated template.
        return "updated_form_template.html"
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/forms/utils.py</file>
<original>
# Again, this is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes.
def render_form(form):
    template_name = "default.html"
    # Rendering logic follows...
</original>
<patched>
# Update the template to a non-deprecated one.
# This is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes.
def render_form(form):
    # Assume "safe_form_template.html" is the new, recommended template.
    template_name = "safe_form_template.html"
    # Rendering logic follows...
</patched>
```

These modifications assume that the deprecation warning is specifically tied to the use of "default.html" in the form rendering process and that an updated or alternative template is available and does not trigger deprecation warnings. The actual patch would need to be developed with a thorough understanding of the deprecation context, the new recommended practices or templates by Django, and testing to ensure compatibility and functionality.
