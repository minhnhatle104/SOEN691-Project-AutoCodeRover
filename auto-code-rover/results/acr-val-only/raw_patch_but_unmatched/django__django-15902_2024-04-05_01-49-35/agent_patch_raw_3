Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the actual codebase or specific details about the deprecation related to "default.html", and considering the inability to match the edits directly to the original program, it's clear that providing a precise and applicable patch is not feasible in this format.

However, addressing the issue generally involves identifying where "default.html" is used within the form rendering process and replacing it with an updated template or method that does not trigger deprecation warnings. Since a direct code patch cannot be provided, developers facing this issue should:

1. Review the Django project's documentation and deprecation notices to understand the context and recommendations for replacing "default.html".
2. Search the project codebase for references to "default.html" in form rendering logic, including but not limited to `django/forms/renderers.py` and `django/forms/utils.py`.
3. Replace references to "default.html" with the recommended, updated template or rendering method.
4. Thoroughly test the updated form rendering to ensure functionality and the absence of deprecation warnings.

This approach requires a detailed review and understanding of the specific project's codebase and the nature of the deprecation involved. Developers should also consider the broader impact of such changes on the project, including compatibility with different versions of Django and the potential need for updates in custom form rendering logic.
