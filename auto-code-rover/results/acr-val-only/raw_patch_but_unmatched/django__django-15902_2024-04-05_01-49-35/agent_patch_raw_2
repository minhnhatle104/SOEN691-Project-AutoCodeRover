Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of the issue described, without direct access to the actual codebase or specific details about the deprecation related to "default.html", creating a precise patch that directly matches the original program is challenging. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to addressing the issue based on standard practices for handling deprecation warnings and updating rendering logic in Django. This approach should be adapted to fit the specific details and code structure of your project.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

The goal is to modify the rendering process for formsets, specifically the `ManagementForm`, to ensure it does not use the deprecated "default.html" template or any deprecated rendering methods. Since direct matches to the program cannot be provided, the following outlines a conceptual approach:

1. **Identify the Deprecated Template Usage**: Review the deprecation warnings and documentation to understand why "default.html" is deprecated and what the recommended replacement is.

2. **Update Template References**: In files where "default.html" is referenced, such as renderers or utility functions involved in form rendering, update the references to use the recommended, non-deprecated template.

3. **Review and Update Form Rendering Logic**: For custom rendering logic that might implicitly rely on "default.html", ensure that the logic is updated to use the new template or rendering approach.

4. **Test the Changes**: Thoroughly test the updated form rendering to ensure that it functions correctly without triggering deprecation warnings.

### Example Conceptual Patch

Since a direct match to the original program cannot be provided, below is an illustrative example of how one might conceptually update a renderer to use a new template:

```python
# Hypothetical original code in django/forms/renderers.py or a similar file
class CustomFormRenderer:
    def get_template(self):
        # This is where "default.html" was previously used
        return "default.html"

# Conceptual patched code
class CustomFormRenderer:
    def get_template(self):
        # Assume "new_form_template.html" is the recommended replacement
        return "new_form_template.html"
```

This example assumes that the form rendering process involves a class or method that specifies the template to be used, and it updates the template reference to a non-deprecated option. The actual implementation details, including the correct file, class, method names, and the new template name, would need to be adapted based on the specific deprecation context and the structure of your Django project.
