        "content": "Based on the information collected from the search results, we can draw several insights relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **LogisticRegressionCV Class**: The `LogisticRegressionCV` class is defined in `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`. It inherits from `LogisticRegression` and includes an `__init__` method where the `Cs` parameter is defined. The `Cs` parameter can be an integer or an array of values for regularization strength. The issue arises when this parameter is set to a numpy array, and `print_changed_only=True` is enabled.\n\n2. **set_config Method**: The `set_config` method is located in `sklearn/_config.py`. It allows setting global configurations for scikit-learn, including the `print_changed_only` parameter. When `print_changed_only` is set to `True`, only the parameters that were set to non-default values will be printed when printing an estimator. This functionality is causing the issue when combined with a numpy array for the `Cs` parameter in `LogisticRegressionCV`.\n\n3. **Usage of print_changed_only=True**: The search for `print_changed_only=True` yielded two results, one in a test (`sklearn/utils/tests/test_pprint.py`) and another in an example (`examples/plot_changed_only_pprint_parameter.py`). Both instances demonstrate setting `print_changed_only` to `True` and its effect on printing estimator parameters. However, neither directly addresses handling numpy arrays as parameters.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how the `print_changed_only` functionality interacts with numpy array parameters in estimators, specifically `LogisticRegressionCV` in this case. The error message indicates a problem with evaluating the truth value of a numpy array, which suggests that somewhere in the code, there's an attempt to evaluate a numpy array in a boolean context, likely related to determining if a parameter has been changed from its default value.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to investigate how parameters are checked for changes and ensure that numpy arrays are handled correctly, avoiding direct boolean evaluations that lead to ambiguity. This likely involves diving deeper into the implementation of the `__repr__` method for estimators or the underlying logic used by `set_config` to apply the `print_changed_only` setting."
