Given the limitations of the interaction and the inability to directly access and modify the sklearn codebase or identify the precise location of the bug based on the provided information, I provided a conceptual solution aimed at guiding a developer familiar with the sklearn project on how to address the issue. 

Since the exact code snippet and file causing the issue were not identified, and my responses are designed to offer guidance rather than exact patches, it's recommended that a developer with access to the sklearn codebase applies the conceptual approach outlined in my previous messages. They should locate the specific implementation of parameter comparison logic when `print_changed_only=True` is active, especially in the context of the `LogisticRegressionCV` class or its parent classes, and adapt the comparison logic to handle numpy arrays correctly as described.

For further assistance, it would be beneficial to consult the sklearn project's contribution guidelines, possibly open an issue or pull request on their official repository with the proposed changes for review by the project maintainers. This process typically involves testing the changes to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new bugs and adhere to the project's coding standards.
