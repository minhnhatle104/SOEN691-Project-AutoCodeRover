Given the constraints and without direct access to the specific code snippet causing the issue, providing an exact patch is challenging. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to address the issue based on common practices for handling such cases in Python. This approach should be adapted by a developer familiar with the specific codebase and the exact location of the bug.

The issue arises from the `print_changed_only` feature, which likely involves comparing current parameter values to their defaults to determine if they have been changed. When a parameter is a numpy array, direct comparison using `==` or `!=` leads to an array of boolean values, which cannot be directly evaluated as a single boolean value in if statements or other boolean contexts. This is likely what causes the `ValueError` mentioned in the issue.

A conceptual fix would involve modifying the comparison logic to correctly handle numpy arrays. Since the exact location of the problematic comparison is not provided, I'll outline a general approach that could be adapted to the specific context within the sklearn codebase.

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>relevant_file.py</file>  # This should be the file where the comparison causing the issue occurs.
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet that causes the issue due to direct comparison of parameter values.
if current_param_value != default_param_value:
    # Do something, e.g., mark the parameter as changed.
</original>
<patched>
import numpy as np

# Updated code snippet with a check to handle numpy arrays correctly.
if isinstance(current_param_value, np.ndarray) and isinstance(default_param_value, np.ndarray):
    if not np.array_equal(current_param_value, default_param_value):
        # The numpy arrays are not equal, so do something, e.g., mark the parameter as changed.
else:
    if current_param_value != default_param_value:
        # The values are not numpy arrays and are not equal, so do something, e.g., mark the parameter as changed.
</patched>
```

This conceptual modification introduces a check to determine if the parameters being compared are numpy arrays. If they are, it uses `np.array_equal` for the comparison, which correctly handles array comparisons by returning a single boolean value indicating whether the arrays are equal. If the parameters are not numpy arrays, it falls back to the standard comparison.

This approach should resolve the `ValueError` by ensuring that comparisons involving numpy arrays are handled in a way that avoids ambiguous boolean contexts. Developers applying this fix will need to locate the exact place in the code where the problematic comparison occurs and adapt the conceptual fix to the specific code structure and logic used there.
