Given the context and the nature of the issue, a patch needs to address the handling of numpy arrays (or potentially other iterable parameters) when `print_changed_only=True` is set. Since the specific location within the `__repr__` method or related functionality where the issue occurs wasn't directly identified, I'll propose a generic solution that could be adapted.

The core of the issue lies in the handling of parameters that are numpy arrays when generating the string representation of an estimator with `print_changed_only=True`. The error suggests that a boolean operation is being attempted on a numpy array, which is ambiguous. A likely place for this to occur is in the comparison of current parameter values to their defaults to determine if they have changed.

Without the exact location of the code causing the issue, I'll assume it's in the logic that generates the string representation of estimators, possibly in `sklearn/utils/_pprint.py` or directly in the `__repr__` method of classes. The patch will involve checking if a parameter is an array and handling it appropriately during this comparison.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/utils/_pprint.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder since the exact original code snippet causing the issue is not provided.
if param_value != default_value:
    changed_params[param_name] = param_value
</original>
<patched>
import numpy as np

# Assuming param_value and default_value could be numpy arrays, we need to handle them appropriately.
if isinstance(param_value, np.ndarray) and isinstance(default_value, np.ndarray):
    if not np.array_equal(param_value, default_value):
        changed_params[param_name] = param_value
elif param_value != default_value:
    changed_params[param_name] = param_value
</patched>
```

This modification checks if both the parameter value and its default are numpy arrays. If they are, it uses `np.array_equal` to compare them, which is the correct way to compare arrays for equality. If they're not arrays, it falls back to the standard comparison. This should prevent the error by avoiding ambiguous boolean operations on arrays.

Please note, since the exact location and code snippet causing the issue were not identified, the above is a conceptual patch. The actual implementation may need to be adapted based on the specific code structure and logic of the `__repr__` method or wherever the comparison is made.
