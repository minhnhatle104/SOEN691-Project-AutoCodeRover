Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears my previous attempts to provide a patch were based on incorrect assumptions about the code structure and the capabilities of Django's migration system. Without direct access to the specific implementation details of the `Profile` model and the nested `Capability` class, and considering the limitations in applying the hypothetical patches, I cannot offer a valid patch that directly corresponds to the original program as described in the issue.

In Django, the issue described typically arises from the migration system's inability to serialize references to methods for default values, especially when those methods are within nested classes. A common workaround involves using a callable that Django can serialize, such as a top-level function or a lambda, though lambdas have their limitations in migrations due to their anonymous nature.

Given the lack of direct matching with the original program and the constraints provided, the best course of action would be to consult Django's official documentation or community resources for guidance on handling default values in migrations, particularly when dealing with nested classes or complex callable references.

For anyone facing similar issues, consider reviewing Django's model field reference, especially the parts about default values, and the documentation on migrations to explore supported patterns and practices for defining serializable default values.
