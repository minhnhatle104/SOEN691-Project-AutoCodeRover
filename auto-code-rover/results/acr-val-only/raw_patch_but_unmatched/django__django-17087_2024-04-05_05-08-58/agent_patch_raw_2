Given the constraints and the need to provide a more realistic solution within the Django framework's capabilities, let's approach the issue with a practical patch. The core issue is that Django's migration system cannot serialize direct references to class methods from nested classes for use as default values in model fields. A common workaround is to define the default value outside of the nested class or use a lambda or globally defined function that Django can serialize.

Since we don't have the exact file path or the complete structure of the `Profile` model with the nested `Capability` class, I'll provide a general solution that should be adapted to the specific project structure.

# modification 1
```python
<file>appname/models.py</file>
<original>default=Capability.default</original>
<patched>default=lambda: [Profile.Capability.BASIC.value]</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The original code snippet `default=Capability.default` attempts to use a class method from the nested `Capability` class as a default value. This approach fails because Django's migration system cannot serialize this reference for the migration files.
- The patched code snippet uses a lambda function as the default value. Lambda functions can be serialized by Django's migration system. The lambda returns a list with the `BASIC` value from the `Capability` enum directly. Note that `.value` is used to access the actual value of the enum member, which is necessary because the `TextChoices` enum members are objects, and we usually want to store their value in the database.
- This approach assumes that `BASIC` is the desired default value and that the enum member's value (`"BASIC"`) is what should be stored in the database. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual model and field requirements.

Please adapt the file path (`appname/models.py`) and the implementation details (like the use of `.value`) to fit the actual structure and requirements of your Django project. This solution provides a way to work around the serialization issue by avoiding direct references to methods in nested classes for default values in migrations.
