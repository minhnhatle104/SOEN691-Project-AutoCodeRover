Given the limitations and the context provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be applied without specific details from the original program. My previous attempts to provide hypothetical patches were based on common practices for resolving similar issues in Django projects. However, without direct access to the conflicting models or the custom database routing logic, creating a precise patch that matches the original program is not feasible.

In this scenario, the best course of action is to manually review and adjust your Django models and database routing configurations based on the general guidance provided:

1. **Ensure Unique `db_table` Names Across Apps**: Manually inspect and update the `db_table` values in the `Meta` class of your models to prevent conflicts.

2. **Review and Adjust Database Routing Logic**: Examine and modify your database router(s) to ensure correct segregation of model operations across your databases.

3. **Consult Django 2.2 Documentation**: Look for relevant changes in Django 2.2 that might impact your models and database routing.

4. **Thorough Testing**: After adjustments, thoroughly test your application for any issues.

I apologize for any confusion and hope the guidance provided is helpful in addressing the issue within the constraints of this format.
