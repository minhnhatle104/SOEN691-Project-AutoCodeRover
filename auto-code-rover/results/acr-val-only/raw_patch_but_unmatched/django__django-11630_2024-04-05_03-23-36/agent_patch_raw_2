Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without specific details on the conflicting models or the exact database routing logic that might be causing the issue, it's challenging to provide a precise patch that directly corresponds to the original program's code. The issue revolves around Django's model conflict due to shared table names across different apps and potentially involves custom database routing logic that isn't handling these cases as expected in Django 2.2.

However, since the direct application of a patch requires matching the original program's code, and given the hypothetical nature of the solution without direct access to the specific models or routing logic causing the issue, a precise patch cannot be provided.

Instead, I recommend the following general steps to address the issue, which you would need to adapt based on your project's specific codebase:

### General Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Ensure Unique `db_table` Names Across Apps**:
   - Manually inspect models in each app that might be using a shared `db_table` name. Update the `db_table` value in the `Meta` class of conflicting models to ensure uniqueness across the entire project.

2. **Review and Adjust Database Routing Logic**:
   - Examine your project's database router(s) to ensure they correctly segregate model operations to their intended databases. Pay special attention to the `db_for_read` and `db_for_write` methods to ensure they handle all cases as expected, especially for models that might have shared names or are intended to interact with specific databases.

3. **Consult Django 2.2 Documentation for Breaking Changes**:
   - Review the [Django 2.2 release notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/2.2/) for any changes related to database routing, model validation, or `db_table` handling that could affect your project. Adjust your models and database routing logic accordingly.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After making adjustments, thoroughly test your application to ensure that models are correctly associated with their intended databases and that no table name conflicts occur. This might involve writing additional unit tests or using Django's testing framework to simulate operations across your project's various apps and databases.

Due to the limitations of this format, these steps are provided as guidance rather than a direct code patch. You'll need to apply these recommendations within the context of your specific project.
