Given the nature of the issue described and the context retrieved, it seems the core problem is not with the specific `Meta` classes of Django's internal models like `django_migrations` or `django_redirect`, as these are unlikely to be directly causing the issue described. Instead, the problem likely lies in how custom models in your project are configured to use the same table names across different apps, and potentially how database routing is handled for these models.

Since the specific models and database routers causing the issue were not identified in the search results provided, I'll outline a general approach to patching this issue based on common Django practices. This approach involves ensuring unique table names for models across different apps and potentially adjusting database routing logic.

### Ensuring Unique Table Names

To avoid conflicts, ensure that each model across your apps has a unique `db_table` value if specified. This is a hypothetical patch assuming there are conflicting table names in your models.

```python
<file>app1/models.py</file>
<original>
class MyModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'shared_table_name'
</original>
<patched>
class MyModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'app1_shared_table_name'
</patched>
```

```python
<file>app2/models.py</file>
<original>
class MyModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'shared_table_name'
</original>
<patched>
class MyModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'app2_shared_table_name'
</patched>
```

### Adjusting Database Routing Logic

If the issue is partly due to how database routing is configured, you might need to adjust your database router(s) to ensure that models are correctly associated with their intended databases. This is a general example of how you might adjust a database router method to handle model-specific logic more effectively.

```python
<file>myproject/routers.py</file>
<original>
def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
    """
    Attempts to read auth models go to auth_db.
    """
    if model._meta.app_label == 'auth':
        return 'auth_db'
    return None
</original>
<patched>
def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
    """
    Attempts to read auth models go to auth_db.
    Adds custom logic to route app1 and app2 models to their respective databases.
    """
    if model._meta.app_label == 'auth':
        return 'auth_db'
    elif model._meta.app_label == 'app1':
        return 'app1_db'
    elif model._meta.app_label == 'app2':
        return 'app2_db'
    return None
</patched>
```

### Note

These modifications are hypothetical and based on common patterns for resolving table name conflicts and database routing issues in Django. You will need to adjust the file paths (`app1/models.py`, `app2/models.py`, `myproject/routers.py`) and the model/database names (`MyModel`, `app1_shared_table_name`, `app2_shared_table_name`, `app1_db`, `app2_db`) to match your actual project structure and naming conventions.
