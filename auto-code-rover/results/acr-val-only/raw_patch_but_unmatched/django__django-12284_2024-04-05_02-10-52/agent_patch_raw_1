Given the nature of the issue and the information provided, I'll propose a hypothetical patch. The issue is that `Model.get_FOO_display()` does not work correctly with inherited choices in Django models. Since we don't have direct access to the specific Django project files or the exact implementation of the `get_FOO_display()` method within Django's source code, this patch will be conceptual and based on common Django practices.

The goal is to ensure that the `get_field_foo_display()` method correctly returns the display value for choices defined in both the parent and child models. A common approach to address issues with inherited choices is to explicitly redefine the field in the child model, ensuring it includes all necessary choices from the parent model plus any additional choices specific to the child model.

# modification 1
```python
<file>tests/model_inheritance/tests.py</file>
<original>
class B(A):
    foo_choice = [("A","output1"),("B","output2"),("C","output3")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254,choices=foo_choice)
</original>
<patched>
class B(A):
    # Explicitly include choices from parent class A and add new choices for B
    foo_choice = A.foo_choice + [("C","output3")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254,choices=foo_choice)
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the `foo_choice` in class `A` is accessible from class `B`. If `foo_choice` in class `A` is not directly accessible (e.g., due to visibility or it being defined in a manner that does not allow direct access), you might need to redefine or access the choices in a different manner, possibly through a class method or property that returns the choices.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and based on the description of the issue. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific project structure, Django version, and how models and fields are defined and used within the project. Additionally, if `A` is an abstract model, its fields (including choices) are inherited by subclasses like `B`, but overriding the field in `B` as shown is a common way to extend or modify the choices in the subclass.
