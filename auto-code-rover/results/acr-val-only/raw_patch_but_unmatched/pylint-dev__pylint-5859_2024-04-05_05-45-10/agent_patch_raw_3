Given the constraints of this simulation and the lack of specific details about the implementation of pylint's codebase, it's not possible to provide a precise and directly applicable patch. However, I can guide you through a conceptual approach to addressing the issue based on standard practices for modifying Python code and making contributions to open-source projects.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

To resolve the issue where pylint's `--notes` option ignores note tags that are entirely punctuation, you would typically follow these steps in a real-world scenario:

1. **Identify the Component**: First, identify the component or module within pylint that processes the `--notes` option and scans the code for matching note tags.

2. **Understand the Logic**: Understand the logic currently used to identify and flag note tags. This might involve parsing comments and matching them against a list of specified note tags.

3. **Modify the Validation**: If the issue is that punctuation-only tags are being ignored, it's likely due to a validation step that filters out these tags based on their character content. You would modify this validation logic to accept tags consisting entirely of punctuation.

4. **Update Tests**: Add or modify unit tests to cover cases where note tags consist entirely of punctuation, ensuring that your changes correctly address the issue without introducing regressions.

5. **Document the Change**: Update the documentation if necessary to reflect that punctuation-only note tags are supported.

### Hypothetical Example

Since I cannot provide a direct patch, here's a hypothetical example of what modifying the validation logic might look like in Python, assuming the existence of a function that validates note tags:

```python
# Hypothetical original validation function
def is_valid_note_tag(tag):
    return tag.isalnum()

# Hypothetical patched validation function
def is_valid_note_tag(tag):
    # Allow tags that are either alphanumeric or entirely punctuation
    return tag.isalnum() or all(char in string.punctuation for char in tag)
```

This example assumes that the issue stems from a validation function that previously only accepted alphanumeric tags. The patched version modifies this logic to also accept tags where every character is a punctuation mark, as defined by Python's `string.punctuation`.

### Real-World Application

In practice, you would need to locate the actual implementation within pylint's codebase, which might involve navigating through several modules and functions. Once the relevant code is identified, you would apply a similar logic adjustment, ensuring that your changes are consistent with pylint's coding standards and contribute to the project's goals.

Finally, contributing your changes back to pylint would involve creating a pull request according to the project's contribution guidelines, including a clear description of the issue and the rationale behind your proposed solution.
