Given the constraints of this simulation, including the lack of direct access to the actual pylint codebase and specific implementation details, I'm unable to provide a precise patch that directly corresponds to existing code within pylint. My previous response was a conceptual solution intended to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the described issue, rather than a literal patch that could be directly applied.

Without the ability to view the actual implementation details in `pylint/checkers/misc.py` or other relevant files, any attempt to craft a patch would be speculative and might not align with the real structure and logic of the pylint codebase.

In a real-world scenario, addressing the issue would involve:

1. **Reviewing the pylint codebase**, specifically the parts that handle the `--notes` option and generate fixme warnings (W0511), to understand the current implementation.
2. **Identifying the exact logic** that leads to punctuation-only note tags being ignored, which could involve how tags are parsed, validated, and matched against comments in the code.
3. **Modifying the relevant code** to ensure that punctuation-only note tags are correctly recognized and processed, which might involve adjusting validation rules or the logic used to match tags against comments.
4. **Testing the changes** extensively to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new problems, including both unit tests and integration tests as appropriate.
5. **Documenting the changes** and submitting them for review according to the project's contribution guidelines, if the work is being done in the context of an open-source project like pylint.

Given these steps and the nature of this simulation, I recommend consulting the pylint project's contribution guidelines, documentation, and possibly discussing the issue with the project maintainers for guidance on how to proceed with creating an actual patch.
