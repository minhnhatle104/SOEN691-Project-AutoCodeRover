Given the context and the goal to enhance the Flask `$ flask routes` command to include subdomain information, I'll provide a hypothetical patch. This patch assumes that the functionality to list routes (including the `$ flask routes` command) is part of Flask's CLI implemented in `src/flask/cli.py`, and it leverages Flask's application and blueprint registration mechanisms to track and display subdomain information for each route.

Please note, the actual implementation details might differ based on the Flask version and its internal architecture. This patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate a possible approach to extending the routes listing functionality.

    for rule in rules:
        methods = ','.join(sorted(rule.methods))
        line = "{:50s} {:20s} {}".format(rule.endpoint, methods, rule)
        click.echo(line)

@click.command('routes', short_help='Show the routes for the app.')
def routes_command():
    from flask import current_app
    rules = sorted(current_app.url_map.iter_rules(), key=lambda rule: rule.endpoint)
    for rule in rules:
        methods = ','.join(sorted(rule.methods))
        # Added subdomain information to the output
        subdomain = rule.subdomain if rule.subdomain else 'None'
        line = "{:50s} {:20s} {:15s} {}".format(rule.endpoint, methods, subdomain, rule)
        click.echo(line)
</patched>
```

This modification adds subdomain information to the output of the `$ flask routes` command. It assumes that the `rule` object has a `subdomain` attribute, which is consistent with Flask's `Rule` object in the routing system. The `subdomain` is displayed alongside each route's endpoint, methods, and rule.

Please adjust the file paths and implementation details according to your project's specific setup and Flask version. This patch is intended as a starting point and might require further customization to fit into the actual codebase seamlessly.
