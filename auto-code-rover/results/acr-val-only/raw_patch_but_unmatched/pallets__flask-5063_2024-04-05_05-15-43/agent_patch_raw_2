Given the constraints and the nature of the task, I'll provide a conceptual approach to how a patch could be formulated based on the common structure of Flask applications and the CLI functionality. Since I cannot directly access or modify files in a real codebase, this example serves as an illustrative guide for how one might approach adding subdomain information to the Flask `$ flask routes` command output.

Please note, the actual implementation may vary based on the specific version of Flask and its internal architecture. This example assumes familiarity with Flask's routing system and the Click library for creating command-line interfaces.

```python
<file>src/flask/cli.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original snippet, as the exact implementation was not provided.
@click.command('routes', short_help='Show the routes for the app.')
def routes_command():
    from flask import current_app
    rules = sorted(current_app.url_map.iter_rules(), key=lambda rule: rule.endpoint)
    for rule in rules:
        methods = ','.join(sorted(rule.methods))
        line = "{:50s} {:20s} {}".format(rule.endpoint, methods, rule)
        click.echo(line)
</original>
<patched>
# This patched snippet includes subdomain information in the routes command output.
@click.command('routes', short_help='Show the routes for the app, including subdomains.')
def routes_command():
    from flask import current_app
    rules = sorted(current_app.url_map.iter_rules(), key=lambda rule: rule.endpoint)
    for rule in rules:
        methods = ','.join(sorted(rule.methods))
        # Check if the rule has a subdomain and include it in the output
        subdomain = rule.subdomain if rule.subdomain else 'No subdomain'
        line = "{:50s} {:20s} {:30s} {}".format(rule.endpoint, methods, subdomain, rule)
        click.echo(line)
</patched>
```

This example modifies the `routes_command` function within a hypothetical `src/flask/cli.py` file to include subdomain information in the output of the `$ flask routes` command. It checks if each route's rule has a `subdomain` attribute and includes this information in the printed line. If a rule does not have a subdomain, it prints 'No subdomain'.

Remember, this is a conceptual example. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on your Flask application's structure, the version of Flask you are using, and how CLI commands are handled in your project.
