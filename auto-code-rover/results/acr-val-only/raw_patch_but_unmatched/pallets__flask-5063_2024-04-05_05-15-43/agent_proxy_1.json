            "content": "- **Do we need more context**:\n  Given the analysis and the information at hand, it seems necessary to understand more about how the `$ flask routes` command is implemented since it's not directly found within the Flask or Blueprint classes. This command is likely part of Flask's CLI tooling or an extension thereof. Therefore, additional context is needed regarding the implementation of Flask's CLI commands, specifically the one that handles route listing. Constructing the following search API calls could provide this context:\n  - `search_code(\"flask routes\")`\n  - `search_code(\"CLI\")`\n  - `search_method(\"cli\")`\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n  Without the specific implementation details of the `$ flask routes` command, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact bug locations. However, based on the analysis, it's likely that modifications or enhancements would need to be made in the files or methods that handle Flask's CLI commands, particularly those related to route listing. Since the direct method or implementation for `$ flask routes` was not found in the initial search, the exact buggy files and methods cannot be specified without further context."
