I understand the situation, but given the constraints of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch that would match the original program without access to the specific codebase or further details about the implementation. My responses are based on the information provided and general knowledge of Django's ORM system.

The issue described involves complexities with Django's `FilteredRelation` and `select_related`, which are advanced features of Django's ORM for optimizing database queries and accessing related objects. The correct resolution would likely involve a deep understanding of the specific models and relationships involved, as well as the intended outcomes of the query.

Without being able to see the actual implementation or the structure of the models (`PoolStyle`, `Pool`, `Tournament`, etc.), any attempt to provide a patch would be speculative and might not accurately address the issue.

In a real-world scenario, resolving this issue would involve:
- Reviewing the models to understand the relationships between `PoolStyle`, `Pool`, and `Tournament`.
- Understanding the intended use of `FilteredRelation` in this context. Typically, `FilteredRelation` is used to apply filters to related objects in a queryset, but it has limitations, especially when used with `select_related`, which is designed for forward relationships.
- Debugging the query to see the generated SQL and identify where the mismatch occurs between the expected and actual behavior.

As a general guideline, when facing issues with Django's ORM:
1. **Consult the Django Documentation**: The documentation for `FilteredRelation` and `select_related` provides valuable insights into their usage and limitations.
2. **Debugging**: Use Django's logging capabilities to inspect the generated SQL query. This can help identify discrepancies between the expected and actual queries.
3. **Community Resources**: The Django users mailing list, Stack Overflow, and Django's issue tracker are excellent resources for finding similar issues or asking for help from the community.
4. **Simplify the Query**: Break down complex queries into simpler parts to isolate the issue. This can help identify whether the problem lies with `FilteredRelation`, `select_related`, or the interaction between them.

I hope this guidance is helpful in addressing the issue, even though I can't provide a direct patch. If you have more specific details or code snippets, I'd be happy to offer more targeted advice.
