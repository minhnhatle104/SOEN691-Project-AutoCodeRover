Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without specific details about the implementation or the ability to directly interact with the codebase, providing an exact patch is challenging. However, I can offer a general approach to addressing issues related to the use of `FilteredRelation` and `select_related` in Django, which might help guide the development of a patch.

### General Approach to Patching

The issue seems to revolve around the incorrect setting or retrieval of related objects when using `FilteredRelation` in conjunction with `select_related`. This might be due to a misunderstanding of how these two functionalities interact, especially in complex, multi-level relationship scenarios.

Django's `FilteredRelation` allows for filtering on related objects without altering the main queryset, while `select_related` is used for performance optimization by turning related object queries into JOINs. However, `FilteredRelation` does not support spanning multi-valued relationships, and its interaction with `select_related` might not work as intuitively expected in multi-level relationships.

### Suggested Patch Approach

Without specific code snippets that directly match the issue, a hypothetical approach would involve ensuring that `FilteredRelation` is correctly applied to a single-level relationship and that `select_related` is used appropriately to prefetch related objects. 

#### Hypothetical Patch Example:

```python
# Since we cannot provide a direct patch without matching original code, here's a conceptual approach:

# Assuming there's a misunderstanding in how FilteredRelation is applied:
<file>app/models.py</file> # Hypothetical file path
<original>
# Original usage that might be causing the issue
</original>
<patched>
# Adjust the FilteredRelation to target a direct, single-level relationship.
# Use select_related or prefetch_related appropriately to optimize related object retrieval.
queryset = ModelName.objects.annotate(
    related_field=FilteredRelation('direct_related_field', condition_name='condition_value')
).select_related('related_field')
</patched>
```

### Key Points:

- Ensure that `FilteredRelation` targets a directly related field and is used with a condition that correctly filters the related objects.
- Use `select_related` to optimize the retrieval of these related objects if they are single-valued (ForeignKey or OneToOneField).
- If dealing with multi-valued relationships (ManyToManyField or reverse ForeignKey), consider using `prefetch_related` instead.
- Review Django's documentation for both `FilteredRelation` and `select_related`/`prefetch_related` to ensure their correct usage according to the latest version of Django you are using.

### Testing and Validation:

After applying any changes, thoroughly test the affected functionality to ensure that the issue is resolved and that no new issues have been introduced. This might include unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing scenarios that replicate the original issue.

### Note:

This approach is speculative and intended to provide guidance based on common Django ORM practices. It's essential to adapt this advice to the specifics of your project and issue.
