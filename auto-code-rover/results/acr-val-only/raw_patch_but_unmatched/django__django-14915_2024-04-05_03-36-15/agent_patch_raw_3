Given the constraints and the specific format required for the patch, it appears there was a misunderstanding in how the patch should be formatted for direct application to the program. Since I cannot access the actual file paths or the exact lines of code from the user's project, I will provide a more generic patch template based on the information available. This template should be adapted by the user to fit their specific file structure and codebase.

```python
<file>user_defined_file_path.py</file>
<original>if value in self.show_fields:  # This is a dict {1: ['first_name', 'last_name']}</original>
<patched>if str(value) in self.show_fields:  # Convert value to string to ensure it's hashable</patched>
```

Please replace `user_defined_file_path.py` with the actual path to the file where the `create_option` method is overridden. The `original` and `patched` sections are based on the conceptual solution provided earlier. This template indicates that wherever the `create_option` method is performing a check `if value in self.show_fields:`, it should be replaced with `if str(value) in self.show_fields:` to ensure that the `value` is hashable by converting it to a string. This approach works around the issue of `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances being unhashable due to the lack of a `__hash__` method.
