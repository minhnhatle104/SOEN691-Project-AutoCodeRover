            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` and how the `create_option` method is implemented and used within the Django project. Specifically, we need to understand the changes in Django 3.1 that could have affected the hashability of `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` and how the `create_option` method interacts with it. Here are the API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class**: This will help us understand if `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` is a part of Django's codebase or a custom implementation within the project. If it's part of Django, we might find relevant changes in Django 3.1 documentation instead. However, searching in the codebase is a good start.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelChoiceIteratorValue\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `create_option` method in the entire codebase**: Since the issue occurs in the `create_option` method, understanding its implementations and any overrides in the project is crucial. This will give us insight into how `value` is being used and why it might be causing hashability issues after the migration.\n   - `search_method(\"create_option\")`\n\nThese searches should provide enough context to start formulating a solution to the issue."
