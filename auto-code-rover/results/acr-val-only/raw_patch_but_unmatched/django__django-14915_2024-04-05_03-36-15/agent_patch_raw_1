```

Explanation: Since the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class does not implement a `__hash__` method, instances of this class are unhashable and cannot be used directly as dictionary keys or checked for membership in a dictionary. The patch converts `value` to a string before checking its presence in `self.show_fields`, ensuring that the operation does not raise a `TypeError` due to unhashable types. This approach assumes that the string representation (`__str__`) of `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances uniquely identifies them, which should be the case based on the class definition provided.
