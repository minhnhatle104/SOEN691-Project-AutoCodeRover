The analysis of the provided search results has given us enough information to identify the cause of the issue and propose a solution.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: \n\nThe bug is not in a specific file or method in the sense of incorrect code within the Django framework or the user's project code. Instead, the issue arises from the interaction between the user's overridden `create_option` method in their custom widget or form field and the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class in Django. The specific location where the user needs to apply the fix is in their overridden `create_option` method, where they check if `value` is in `self.show_fields`. The exact file path is not provided, but it would be wherever this custom method is defined in the user's project. \n\n**Buggy method**:\n- The user's overridden `create_option` method, specifically the line where `value` is checked against `self.show_fields`. The modification suggested involves ensuring `value` is hashable by converting it to a string before performing the check."
