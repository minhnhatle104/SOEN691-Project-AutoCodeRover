Given the constraints and the nature of this interaction, I'm unable to provide a patch that directly corresponds to the actual source code without seeing the specific implementation details from the Django project's PostgreSQL backend. My responses are based on hypothetical scenarios and general programming practices, aiming to guide you towards a solution based on the described issue.

To address the issue within the Django framework, where additional parameters should be passed before the database name when invoking `psql` through the `dbshell` command, the general approach involves modifying the argument construction logic to ensure the correct order. However, without access to the exact code structure and implementation details, I can only suggest a conceptual approach:

1. Identify where the command-line arguments for `psql` are constructed in the `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` file.
2. Adjust this logic to append additional parameters before the database name.

Since I cannot provide a precise patch, I recommend reviewing the actual implementation in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`, focusing on how the list of arguments for the `psql` command is constructed. The goal is to ensure that any additional parameters (`-c "select * from some_table;"` in the issue description) are added to this list before the database name is appended.

For developers facing similar issues, the process involves:

- Locating the method responsible for constructing the `psql` command.
- Ensuring additional parameters are included in the command list before the database name.
- Testing the modified logic to confirm that `psql` correctly processes the additional parameters when the `dbshell` command is executed.

This approach aligns with best practices for debugging and modifying backend database configurations in web frameworks like Django.
