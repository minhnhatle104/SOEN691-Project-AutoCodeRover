The issue specifically mentions that additional parameters should be passed before the database name when invoking `psql` through this management command.\n\nSince the direct search for a `dbshell` method in the entire codebase returned no results, it's possible that the functionality is encapsulated within a class or a differently named method that handles database shell interactions. The management command `dbshell` might be a higher-level abstraction, possibly defined in a class related to database management or command-line interface utilities.\n\nGiven the lack of direct hits, a strategic approach to understanding how `dbshell` is implemented involves looking for classes or methods that might be responsible for handling database commands or shell interactions. This could include searching for classes related to command-line management or database utilities.\n\nHowever, without direct access to search results or further information from the codebase, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. Searching for classes that might be responsible for handling database commands or shell interactions. This could include classes like `DatabaseCommand`, `ShellCommand`, or similar.\n2. Exploring the codebase for files that are likely to contain management commands, such as `commands.py`, `db_utils.py`, or similar, and then searching within those files for relevant methods or command definitions.\n3. Considering the context of the issue, it might also be helpful to search for code snippets related to command-line argument handling or `psql` invocation patterns to see if there's a specific place where the database name and additional parameters are concatenated.\n\nGiven the limitations of our interaction, the next best step would be to manually explore the codebase based on these strategies or to consult documentation related to the framework or library that provides the `dbshell` management command."

The references to `psql` in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` and the tests specifically for PostgreSQL in `tests/dbshell/test_postgresql.py` suggest that these files are likely where the bug resides. The absence of hits for `DatabaseCommand` and `ShellCommand` classes, along with the lack of direct references to `manage.py dbshell` in the code snippets, indicates that the issue is more narrowly focused on the PostgreSQL backend implementation and its testing.\n\nGiven this context, the bug locations can be inferred as follows:\n\n- **Buggy files and methods:**\n  - The primary bug location is likely within `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`. This file is expected to contain the implementation of the PostgreSQL client for Django, including how it constructs the command-line call to `psql`. The issue described suggests that the order of arguments passed to `psql` is incorrect, with the database name not being placed at the end of the argument list as required.\n  - The tests in `tests/dbshell/test_postgresql.py` are relevant for understanding how the current implementation is tested and may provide insights into the expected behavior and possibly the incorrect handling of command-line arguments.\n\nTo address the issue, one would need to review the implementation in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`, specifically looking for how the command-line arguments for invoking `psql` are constructed and ensuring that the database name is appended to the end of the argument list. Adjustments should be made to reorder the arguments appropriately. Additionally, reviewing and possibly updating the tests in `tests/dbshell/test_postgresql.py` would be necessary to ensure that this behavior is correctly tested and that any future changes do not reintroduce this issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve directly examining the code in these identified files, understanding the current implementation, and making the necessary adjustments to resolve the issue."
