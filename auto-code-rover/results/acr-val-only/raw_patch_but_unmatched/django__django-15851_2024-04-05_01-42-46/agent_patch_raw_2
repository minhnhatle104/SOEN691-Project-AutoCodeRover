Given the limitations and the hypothetical nature of the task, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the Django project's PostgreSQL backend (`django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`), creating an exact patch is challenging. However, I can provide a more generalized example of how such a patch might be structured, based on common practices in handling command-line arguments within such a context. This example aims to illustrate the concept rather than provide an exact match for the existing codebase.

# Hypothetical Patch

```python
<file>django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original code snippet, assuming the database name is added before additional parameters.
command = [settings_dict['CLIENT_EXECUTABLE'], dbname]
if extra_params:
    command += extra_params
</original>
<patched>
# In the patched version, the database name is appended after the additional parameters.
command = [settings_dict['CLIENT_EXECUTABLE']]
if extra_params:
    command += extra_params
command.append(dbname)
</patched>
```

This patch assumes that the original implementation incorrectly appends the database name before adding any additional parameters specified by the user. The corrected version first initializes the command list with the path to the `psql` executable, then extends this list with any extra parameters, and finally appends the database name to ensure it is placed at the end of the command list.

Please note, this is a generalized example meant to illustrate the approach to solving the described issue. The actual implementation details, including variable names (`settings_dict`, `dbname`, `extra_params`), and the structure of the command construction logic, may vary in the Django project's codebase. This example assumes a simplistic approach for educational purposes and may require adaptation to fit the actual code structure and practices used in Django.
