Given the context of the issue with the `dbshell` command in Django, specifically for PostgreSQL where additional parameters should be passed before the database name, I'll draft a hypothetical patch. This patch assumes the structure of Django's database backend for PostgreSQL, particularly focusing on how command-line arguments are constructed for the `psql` command. Since I don't have direct access to the actual source code, the patch will be based on a general understanding of how such a feature might be implemented in Django.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py</file>
<original>
args = [settings_dict['CLIENT_EXECUTABLE'], dbname]
if params:
    args.extend(params)
</original>
<patched>
args = [settings_dict['CLIENT_EXECUTABLE']]
if params:
    args.extend(params)
args.append(dbname)
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the original implementation constructs the `args` list by first including the path to the `psql` executable and the database name, followed by any additional parameters. The patched version changes this logic to append the database name to the `args` list after any additional parameters have been included. This ensures that when the `psql` command is executed, the additional parameters precede the database name, adhering to `psql`'s expected argument order.

Please note, this patch is based on a hypothetical structure of the `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` file and the described issue. The actual implementation in Django may differ, and thus, the patch might need adjustments to fit the actual codebase.
