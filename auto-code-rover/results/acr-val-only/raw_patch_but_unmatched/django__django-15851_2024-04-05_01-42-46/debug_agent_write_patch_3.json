The issue specifically mentions that additional parameters should be passed before the database name when invoking `psql` through this management command.\n\nSince the direct search for a `dbshell` method in the entire codebase returned no results, it's possible that the functionality is encapsulated within a class or a differently named method that handles database shell interactions. The management command `dbshell` might be a higher-level abstraction, possibly defined in a class related to database management or command-line interface utilities.\n\nGiven the lack of direct hits, a strategic approach to understanding how `dbshell` is implemented involves looking for classes or methods that might be responsible for handling database commands or shell interactions. This could include searching for classes related to command-line management or database utilities.\n\nHowever, without direct access to search results or further information from the codebase, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. Searching for classes that might be responsible for handling database commands or shell interactions. This could include classes like `DatabaseCommand`, `ShellCommand`, or similar.\n2. Exploring the codebase for files that are likely to contain management commands, such as `commands.py`, `db_utils.py`, or similar, and then searching within those files for relevant methods or command definitions.\n3. Considering the context of the issue, it might also be helpful to search for code snippets related to command-line argument handling or `psql` invocation patterns to see if there's a specific place where the database name and additional parameters are concatenated.\n\nGiven the limitations of our interaction, the next best step would be to manually explore the codebase based on these strategies or to consult documentation related to the framework or library that provides the `dbshell` management command."
