Please describe.**\nI have two situations:\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\n</issue>"

This could mean that the handling of inherited members might not be explicitly tagged with this option in the code or that it's managed through a more indirect mechanism, possibly through configuration settings or metadata passed to documentation generation functions.\n\n2. **`automodule` Directive Implementation and Usage**:\n   - The `automodule` directive appears to be significant within the project, with references found in multiple files. Specifically, it is mentioned in:\n     - `sphinx/ext/apidoc.py`\n     - `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\n     - `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`\n     - Test files: `tests/test_ext_autodoc_automodule.py` and `tests/test_ext_apidoc.py`\n   - This distribution of references suggests that `automodule` is a core feature with its logic possibly spread across initialization, processing, and testing phases of the documentation generation process.\n\n3. **No Direct References to \"base classes\"**: The absence of direct references to \"base classes\" in the search results indicates that the handling of base classes, especially in the context of documenting inherited members, might not be straightforward or might be encapsulated within more complex logic. It's also possible that the terminology used internally differs from the search query.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps for addressing the issue would involve a deeper dive into the files identified as potentially relevant, especially those related to `automodule`. Since the direct search for `:inherited-members:` and \"base classes\" did not yield results, the implementation details regarding how inherited members are documented\u2014or how base classes are identified and processed\u2014might require examining the logic within the `automodule` directive's handling and related functions.\n\nTo proceed, it would be beneficial to:\n- Examine the implementation of the `automodule` directive in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and related files to understand how modules and classes are processed for documentation.\n- Look into the test files (`tests/test_ext_autodoc_automodule.py` and `tests/test_ext_apidoc.py`) to see if there are any tests related to the documentation of inherited members, which could provide clues on the expected behavior and current capabilities.\n\nThis analysis should help in formulating a strategy to modify or extend the `automodule` directive to support the feature request described in the issue."

        "content": "The search results provide valuable insights into how the `automodule` directive and related functionalities are implemented across different parts of the project. Here's a summary of the findings and their implications for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **`sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`**:\n   - The `automodule` directive is referenced in the context of processing docstrings (`cut_lines` function) and handling module names (`ModuleDocumenter` class, `resolve_name` and `parse_name` functions). These references suggest that `automodule` is integrated into the documentation generation process, particularly in how modules are documented and how their names are resolved.\n   - The absence of direct references to \"inherited members\" in this file suggests that the handling of inherited members might not be explicitly defined here or might be abstracted away into more general mechanisms for processing documentation.\n\n2. **`sphinx/ext/apidoc.py`**:\n   - References to `automodule` in functions like `create_module_file`, `create_package_file`, and `get_parser` indicate that `automodule` is used in generating documentation files for modules and packages, as well as in parsing command-line arguments for documentation generation tasks. This usage pattern underscores the directive's role in the automated creation of documentation.\n\n3. **`sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`**:\n   - The `find_autosummary_in_lines` function's references to `automodule` suggest that `automodule` is considered when generating summary documentation, likely as part of identifying and documenting module contents automatically.\n\n4. **`tests/test_ext_autodoc_automodule.py`**:\n   - The presence of tests specifically targeting `automodule`, including tests for undocumented members, special members, and inherited members, confirms that there is a testing framework in place to validate the behavior of `automodule` in various scenarios. Notably, the `test_automodule_inherited_members` function directly relates to the issue at hand, indicating that there is some level of support or consideration for inherited members within the testing suite.\n\n**Analysis and Next Steps**:\nGiven the absence of direct references to a mechanism for handling multiple inherited members selectively (as described in the issue), and considering the spread of `automodule` functionality across different parts of the project, the solution to the issue likely involves modifications in multiple areas:\n\n- Enhancing the `ModuleDocumenter` class to support selective documentation of inherited members from specific base classes.\n- Updating functions related to module and package file creation in `sphinx/ext/apidoc.py` to respect new configurations for inherited members.\n- Ensuring that the `autosummary` generation process in `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py` can accommodate the selective inclusion or exclusion of inherited members based on the new feature.\n- Expanding the test suite in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_automodule.py`, especially the `test_automodule_inherited_members` function, to cover scenarios involving multiple base classes and selective documentation.\n\nThe next step would involve drafting a detailed implementation plan that addresses these areas, ensuring that the new feature is integrated seamlessly into the existing documentation generation process while maintaining backward compatibility and user expectations."
