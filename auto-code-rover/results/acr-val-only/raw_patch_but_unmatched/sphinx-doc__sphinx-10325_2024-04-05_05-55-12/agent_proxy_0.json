Specifically, we should look into the implementation of the automodule directive and any logic related to handling inherited members. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the implementation or usage of the `:inherited-members:` option to understand its current handling.\n   - `search_code(\":inherited-members:\")`\n\n2. Search for the implementation of the `automodule` directive to understand how modules and their classes are processed.\n   - `search_code(\"automodule\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the need to ignore certain base classes when documenting inherited members, it would be useful to understand how base classes are currently identified and processed.\n   - `search_code(\"base classes\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current implementation and identify where modifications are needed to support the requested feature."
