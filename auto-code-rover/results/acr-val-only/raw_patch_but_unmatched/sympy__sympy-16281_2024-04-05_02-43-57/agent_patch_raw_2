Given the constraints and the lack of direct access to the specific implementation details for the pretty printing of the `Product` class in the provided code snippet, it's not possible to craft an exact patch without seeing the actual implementation of the pretty printing logic within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. The provided code snippet from `sympy/concrete/products.py` does not directly include the pretty printing logic, which is likely handled in a separate pretty printing module or function specific to rendering expressions in a human-readable format.

To address the issue as described, modifications would need to be made in the part of the SymPy codebase that handles the pretty printing of mathematical expressions, specifically for the `Product` class. This would involve adjusting the layout to remove unnecessary whitespace, possibly making the product symbol less wide, and considering the extension of the top bar of the product symbol. However, without direct access to the relevant code sections that generate the pretty-printed output for `Product` instances, it's not feasible to provide a precise patch.

For anyone looking to address this issue within the SymPy codebase, the recommended steps would be:

1. Locate the function or class method within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` or a related file that is responsible for generating the pretty-printed representation of `Product` instances.
2. Within this function or method, identify the logic that constructs the visual representation of the product symbol, including its dimensions and the arrangement of elements (such as the product term and limits).
3. Implement adjustments to this logic to address the specific concerns raised in the issue description, such as optimizing the spacing and dimensions of the product symbol and ensuring that the overall layout is visually balanced and consistent with mathematical notation standards.
4. Test the modifications with various `Product` expressions to ensure that the pretty-printed output is improved and that no new issues have been introduced.

Without the specific implementation details, this guidance outlines the general approach to resolving the issue based on the description and the structure of the SymPy library.
