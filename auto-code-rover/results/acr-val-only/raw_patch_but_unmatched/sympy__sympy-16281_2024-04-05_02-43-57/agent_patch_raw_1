# Since the specific implementation details for pretty printing of `Product` are not provided in the snippet,
# we assume a generic modification in the pretty printing logic that could address the reported issue.
# This is a hypothetical example showing how one might start to address the issue based on the description.
def _print_Product(self, product):
    # Original pretty printing logic for Product, which might produce the described output.
    # This is a placeholder for the actual original implementation which was not provided.

from sympy.printing.pretty.stringpict import prettyForm

def _print_Product(self, product):
    # Adjusted pretty printing logic for Product to address the issue.
    # This is a hypothetical patch and should be adjusted based on the actual implementation.
    
    # Example adjustment: remove the extra line at the bottom and make the ∏ symbol less fat.
    # Extend the top bar if necessary. This is a conceptual patch and might need adjustments.
    
    # Assuming `product_expr` is the pretty form of the product's expression and `limits_str` is
    # the pretty form of the product's limits, both of which need to be generated based on the actual logic.
    
    product_expr = self._print(product.function)  # Hypothetical method call to get the pretty form of the product's expression
    limits_str = self._print_limits(product.limits)  # Hypothetical method call to get the pretty form of the product's limits
    
    # Create the pretty form of the product symbol with adjusted dimensions and formatting
    prod_symbol = prettyForm(u"∏")
    
    # Adjust the layout to address the issue
    top_line = prettyForm(u"─" * (len(product_expr.width()) + 2))
    bottom_line = prettyForm(u"")
    
    # Combine parts together with appropriate spacing and formatting
    pretty_prod = prettyForm(*prod_symbol.above(top_line, product_expr, bottom_line, limits_str))
    
    return pretty_prod

```

Please note that the above modification is conceptual and based on the description of the issue. The actual implementation would require access to the specific logic used for pretty printing `Product` objects in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. The key idea is to adjust the formatting of the product symbol, remove unnecessary whitespace, and potentially extend the top bar as suggested in the issue description. Further adjustments may be necessary based on the actual code structure and logic.
