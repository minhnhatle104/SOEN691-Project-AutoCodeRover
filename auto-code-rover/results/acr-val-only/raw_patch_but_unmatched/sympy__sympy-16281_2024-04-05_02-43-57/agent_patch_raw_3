Given the constraints and the lack of direct access to the specific implementation details in the code snippet provided, it's challenging to provide an exact patch without seeing the specific implementation details of the pretty printing logic within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` or a related module that handles the pretty printing of the `Product` class in the codebase.

However, based on the description of the issue and assuming that the pretty printing logic for `Product` objects involves specific formatting rules that define how the product symbol and its associated elements are rendered, one could conceptualize a patch that addresses the concerns raised in the issue. This would involve adjusting the layout to remove unnecessary whitespace, making the product symbol less wide, and considering adjustments to the layout to ensure it is visually appealing and adheres to a high standard.

For anyone looking to address this issue in the actual codebase, the recommended approach would involve:

1. Locating the function or class method within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` or a related file that is responsible for generating the pretty-printed representation of `Product` instances.
2. Within this function or method, identifying the logic that constructs the pretty-printed representation of the product symbol, including its dimensions and the arrangement of elements (such as the product term and limits).
3. Implementing adjustments to this logic to address the specific concerns raised in the issue description, such as optimizing the spacing and dimensions of the product symbol and ensuring that the layout is visually appealing and consistent with mathematical notation standards.
4. Testing the modifications with various expressions to ensure that the changes lead to an improved appearance and that no new issues are introduced.

Without direct access to the relevant code sections and specific details about the implementation, it's not feasible to provide a precise patch. The guidance outlined above offers a general approach to resolving the issue based on the description and an understanding of how pretty printing functionality might be structured within the SymPy codebase.
