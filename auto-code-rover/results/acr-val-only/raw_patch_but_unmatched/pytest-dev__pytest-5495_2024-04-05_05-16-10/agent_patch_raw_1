Given the issue with confusing assertion rewriting messages for byte strings and the identified potential locations within the pytest framework, I'll provide a hypothetical patch aimed at making the representation of byte string differences in assertion errors more intuitive. This patch is speculative and based on the general understanding of the issue and the identified files. It's important to review and test any changes thoroughly in the actual project context.

### Modification 1: Enhancing Byte String Representation in Error Messages

Assuming the issue lies in how byte strings are represented when there's a difference in an assertion, a more user-friendly approach could involve explicitly stating the difference in terms of characters or hex values, rather than ASCII ordinals.

```python
<file>src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py</file>
<original>
def saferepr(obj, maxsize=240):
    ...
    if isinstance(obj, bytes):
        return repr(obj)
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def saferepr(obj, maxsize=240):
    ...
    if isinstance(obj, bytes):
        # Represent byte strings in a more intuitive way, showing hex values.
        return ' '.join([f"{b:02x}" for b in obj])
    ...
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Adjusting Diff Generation for Byte Strings

If the diff generation for byte strings is part of the confusion, adjusting how diffs are presented could help. This modification assumes there's a specific method handling diff generation where byte strings are involved.

```python
<file>src/_pytest/_code/code.py</file>
<original>
def get_diff_text(left, right):
    ...
    # Hypothetical code handling diff generation
    diff = difflib.ndiff(left, right)
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def get_diff_text(left, right):
    ...
    # Adjust diff generation for byte strings to be more intuitive
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        # Convert bytes to a more readable format before generating diff
        left = ' '.join([f"{b:02x}" for b in left])
        right = ' '.join([f"{b:02x}" for b in right])
    diff = difflib.ndiff(left, right)
    ...
</patched>
```

These modifications are speculative and aim to address the issue by making byte string differences in assertion errors more intuitive, specifically by representing byte strings in hex format. It's crucial to review these changes within the context of the actual project, considering the specific mechanisms of assertion rewriting and error reporting. Additionally, thorough testing is necessary to ensure that these changes effectively address the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
