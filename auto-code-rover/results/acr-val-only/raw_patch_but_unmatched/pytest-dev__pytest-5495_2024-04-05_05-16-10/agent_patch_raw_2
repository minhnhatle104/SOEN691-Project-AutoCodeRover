Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the pytest framework or the exact code responsible for the confusing assertion rewriting messages for byte strings, providing a precise patch is challenging. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to address the issue based on common practices in handling byte strings and error messages in Python. This conceptual approach should be adapted to fit the actual codebase.

### Conceptual Patch for Byte String Assertion Messages

The goal is to make the assertion failure messages for byte strings more intuitive, possibly by providing a clearer representation of the byte values and their corresponding characters (if printable) or by offering a hex representation.

#### Conceptual Modification 1: Enhancing Byte String Representation in Error Messages

**File**: `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` (Hypothetical location)

**Original**:
```python
# This is a conceptual snippet, as the original code is not provided.
def saferepr(obj, maxsize=240):
    if isinstance(obj, bytes):
        return repr(obj)
```

**Patched**:
```python
def saferepr(obj, maxsize=240):
    if isinstance(obj, bytes):
        # Convert bytes to a more readable hex representation, with ASCII characters if printable.
        hex_representation = ' '.join([f"{b:02x}" for b in obj])
        ascii_representation = ''.join([chr(b) if 32 <= b <= 127 else '.' for b in obj])
        return f"{hex_representation} ('{ascii_representation}')"
```

#### Conceptual Modification 2: Adjusting Diff Generation for Byte Strings

**File**: `src/_pytest/_code/code.py` (Hypothetical location)

**Original**:
```python
# This is a conceptual snippet, as the original code is not provided.
def get_diff_text(left, right):
    # Hypothetical code handling diff generation
    diff = difflib.ndiff(left, right)
```

**Patched**:
```python
def get_diff_text(left, right):
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        # Convert bytes to a more readable format before generating diff
        left_hex = ' '.join([f"{b:02x}" for b in left])
        right_hex = ' '.join([f"{b:02x}" for b in right])
        left = f"{left_hex} ('{''.join([chr(b) if 32 <= b <= 127 else '.' for b in left])}')"
        right = f"{right_hex} ('{''.join([chr(b) if 32 <= b <= 127 else '.' for b in right])}')"
    diff = difflib.ndiff(left, right)
```

### Note:
These modifications are conceptual and aim to provide a starting point for addressing the issue. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific architecture and coding practices of the pytest framework or the project in question. It's crucial to locate the exact points in the code where byte strings are formatted for assertion errors and apply a similar logic to improve the clarity of the error messages. Additionally, thorough testing is necessary to ensure that the changes effectively address the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
