Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to directly access or modify the program's codebase to create precise patches. However, based on the issue description and common Django practices, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the problem described. Since I cannot provide exact matches for the original program, the following suggestions are meant to guide you towards resolving the issue based on standard Django patterns.

### Conceptual Patch for Handling Optional URL Parameters in Django

#### Adjusting the URL Pattern

The issue might stem from how the optional `format` parameter is defined in the URL pattern. The original pattern seems to expect the `format` parameter but does not properly handle its optionality, leading to a mismatch in the arguments passed to the view function.

**Suggested Conceptual Change:**

```python
# Assuming the original URL pattern is in your_project/urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    # Original problematic pattern
    # re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),

    # Conceptually updated pattern to correctly handle the optional 'format' parameter
    re_path(r'^module(?:/(?P<format>html|json|xml))?/$', views.modules, name='modules'),
]
```

This adjustment ensures that the `format` parameter is optional and that the URL correctly ends with a slash, whether or not the `format` parameter is provided.

#### Updating the View Function Signature

The view function needs to handle the `format` parameter being optional. If the original function does not correctly default to `'html'` when `format` is not provided, it should be adjusted.

**Suggested Conceptual Change:**

```python
# Assuming the view function is defined in your_project/views.py
def modules(request, format=None):
    if not format:
        format = 'html'
    # Proceed with handling the request, using 'format' as needed
```

This change ensures that `format` defaults to `'html'` if it is not provided in the URL, addressing the issue where the function receives more arguments than it expects when the `format` parameter is omitted.

### Note

These suggested changes are conceptual and based on the description of the issue. They aim to guide you towards resolving the problem within the Django framework, assuming standard practices and patterns. The exact implementation might require adjustments based on your specific project setup, Django version, and other factors. Always test your changes thoroughly in a development environment before deploying them to production.
