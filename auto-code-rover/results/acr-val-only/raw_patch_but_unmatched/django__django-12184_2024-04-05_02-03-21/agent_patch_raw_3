Given the limitations and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch that matches the original program's code due to the lack of specific file paths, line numbers, and direct access to the codebase. However, based on the described issue and common Django practices, I can offer a general solution that should address the problem of optional URL parameters causing crashes in view functions when migrating to Django 3.0.

### General Solution to Address the Issue

The problem described involves handling optional parameters in URL patterns and ensuring that view functions receive the correct number of arguments. The error message indicates that the `modules` view function is receiving more arguments than expected, likely due to the way optional parameters are defined in the URL pattern.

#### Conceptual Patch

Since I cannot provide a direct patch with file paths and exact code snippets, here's a conceptual approach to resolving the issue:

1. **Adjust the URL Pattern to Correctly Define Optional Parameters**

Ensure that the URL pattern in your Django project's `urls.py` file correctly defines the `format` parameter as optional. The Django `re_path` function allows for regex patterns that can make a parameter optional.

```python
# Conceptual adjustment to the URL pattern
urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>html|json|xml)?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
]
```

Make sure that the regex pattern correctly captures the `format` parameter as optional. The `?` after the parameter group `(html|json|xml)` indicates that the parameter is optional.

2. **Update the View Function to Handle Optional Parameters**

Modify the `modules` view function in your views module (e.g., `views.py`) to provide a default value for the `format` parameter if it is not supplied in the URL.

```python
# Conceptual adjustment to the view function
def modules(request, format=None):
    if format is None:
        format = 'html'
    # The rest of the view logic
```

This ensures that the `format` parameter defaults to `'html'` if it is not provided in the URL, preventing the error caused by the function receiving an unexpected number of arguments.

### Testing and Verification

After making these conceptual adjustments:

- Test the application with URLs that include the `format` parameter and URLs that omit it, ensuring that the view function behaves as expected in both cases.
- Review the Django documentation for the version you are using to ensure that the regex syntax and view function parameter handling align with the framework's requirements.

### Final Note

This general solution is based on the information provided and standard Django URL and view function patterns. The exact implementation may need to be adjusted based on your specific project setup and Django version.
