Given the nature of the issue described, which involves handling optional URL parameters in Django and the error indicating that the view function is receiving more arguments than expected, a hypothetical patch can be proposed. This patch assumes the use of Django's URL dispatcher and view function definitions. Since the exact file paths and original code snippets are not provided, the following patch is based on common Django patterns and the details available in the issue description.

### Modification 1: Adjusting the URL Pattern

To ensure that the URL pattern correctly handles optional parameters and does not pass unexpected arguments to the view function, we might need to adjust the URL pattern definition.

```python
<file>your_project/urls.py</file>
<original>
re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
</original>
<patched>
from django.urls import re_path

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^module/(?:(?P<format>html|json|xml)/)?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
]
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the `format` parameter is correctly captured as an optional parameter. The use of `?:` in the regex makes the preceding group a non-capturing one, which is useful for optional groups that do not need to be captured separately. This change should help in correctly routing requests to the `modules` view function with or without the `format` parameter.

### Modification 2: Updating the View Function Signature

If the view function is not correctly set up to handle an optional `format` parameter, it needs to be adjusted. This ensures that the function can gracefully handle cases where the `format` parameter is not provided in the URL.

```python
<file>your_project/views.py</file>
<original>
def modules(request, format='html'):
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def modules(request, format=None):
    if format is None:
        format = 'html'
    # Proceed with the rest of the function using the format variable
</patched>
```

This modification explicitly checks if the `format` parameter is `None` and sets a default value within the function body. This approach provides more flexibility in handling the absence of the parameter and can be extended to include additional logic based on whether the parameter was provided.

### Note

These modifications are based on common Django patterns and the details provided in the issue description. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific project structure, Django version, and other context-specific details not available in the issue description. Always test changes thoroughly in a development environment before applying them to production.
