Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on the common practices for handling the migration from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField in Django, and dealing with unique constraints. Since I don't have access to the actual file paths or the original code snippets, I'll use placeholders where specific details would be necessary. This example assumes we're modifying the `Authors` model and its migrations to address the issue described.

# modification 1
```python
<file>authors/models.py</file>
<original>
class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_set = models.ForeignKey(
        ProjectDataSet,
        on_delete=models.PROTECT
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)
</original>
<patched>
class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_sets = models.ManyToManyField(
        ProjectDataSet,
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>authors/migrations/XXXX_auto_change_projectdataset_to_m2m.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming this is the automatically generated migration that attempts to change the ForeignKey to ManyToManyField
# and fails due to unique constraints. The actual migration code would depend on Django's auto-generated code,
# which we cannot precisely predict without the actual migration file.
</original>
<patched>
from django.db import migrations, models

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('authors', 'previous_migration_file_name'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RemoveField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_set',
        ),
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_sets',
            field=models.ManyToManyField(to='app_name.ProjectDataSet'),
        ),
        # Assuming manual handling of data migration if necessary
        # migrations.RunPython(code_to_migrate_data_from_fk_to_m2m),
    ]
</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>authors/migrations/YYYY_remove_unique_together.py</file>
<original>
# This would be the migration file that removes the unique_together constraint.
# The actual content would depend on the specific migration generated by Django.
</original>
<patched>
from django.db import migrations

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('authors', 'XXXX_auto_change_projectdataset_to_m2m'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
            name='authors',
            unique_together=set(),
        ),
    ]
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are hypothetical and based on the description of the issue. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific details of your project, such as the exact names of models, fields, and migration dependencies. Additionally, if data migration is necessary when changing from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField, you would need to implement a custom data migration to handle the transfer of existing relationships to the new ManyToMany structure.
