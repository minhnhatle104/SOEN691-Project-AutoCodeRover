Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the original program's codebase and specific file paths, creating a precise patch is challenging. However, I can provide a general approach to address the described issue within Django's ORM system, focusing on common areas where such problems might arise. This approach is based on the understanding of Django ORM behaviors and best practices.

### General Approach to Addressing Self-Referencing Foreign Key Ordering Issue

#### Approach 1: Override Default Model Ordering for Specific Querysets
If the default ordering of the `OneModel` is causing unexpected results in querysets involving self-referencing foreign keys, consider overriding this ordering explicitly in your queryset.

```python
# Hypothetical adjustment in the queryset construction
# Assuming the unexpected DESC order is due to the OneModel's Meta ordering

# Original approach (not provided due to lack of specific code snippet)
# qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).order_by("record__root_id")

# Adjusted approach
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).order_by("record__root_id").reverse()
```

#### Approach 2: Modify Model Meta Ordering Temporarily in Querysets
Temporarily modify or ignore the model's default ordering within specific querysets where the issue occurs.

```python
# Assuming the model's default ordering is causing issues in specific querysets

# Original model Meta ordering might look like this:
class OneModel(models.Model):
    # fields definition
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-id']

# When constructing the problematic queryset, explicitly clear the ordering
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).order_by().order_by("record__root_id")
```

#### Approach 3: Use Annotate and Explicit Ordering Together
Leverage Django's `annotate()` to add a field to order by, which might help in simplifying the SQL query and avoiding unintended ordering behavior.

```python
# Given the issue with ordering in self-referencing foreign key scenarios

# Original queryset construction (hypothetical)
# qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).order_by("record__root_id")

# Adjusted queryset using annotate for clearer ordering
from django.db.models import F
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).annotate(root_id=F("record__root__id")).order_by("root_id")
```

### Note:
These approaches are based on general Django ORM patterns and the description of the issue. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on your specific models, fields, and the structure of your Django project. Testing any changes in a development environment before applying them to your production codebase is crucial to ensure they resolve the issue without unintended side effects.
