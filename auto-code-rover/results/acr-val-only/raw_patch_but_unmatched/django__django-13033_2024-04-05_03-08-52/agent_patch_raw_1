Given the issue described involves unexpected ordering behavior in Django's ORM when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys, and without specific file paths or original code snippets to directly modify, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common Django patterns. This patch aims to address potential causes of such issues, focusing on model definition and queryset manipulation.

### Hypothetical Patch for Self-Referencing Foreign Key Ordering Issue

#### Modification 1: Adjusting Model Meta Ordering
If the unexpected ordering is due to Django's default ordering behavior inherited from the `OneModel`'s Meta class, you might consider explicitly setting or overriding the ordering in your queryset to ensure it behaves as expected.

```python
<file>models.py</file>
<original>
class OneModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        ordering = ("-id",)
</original>
<patched>
class OneModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        ordering = []  # Remove default ordering to avoid unexpected global effects
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Explicit Ordering in QuerySet
To address the issue in the queryset where the unexpected DESC ordering appears due to the default model ordering, explicitly set the ordering in the queryset to ensure it follows the expected behavior.

```python
<file>views.py or wherever the queryset is constructed</file>
<original>
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).order_by("record__root_id")
</original>
<patched>
# Explicitly set ordering to override any default model ordering
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).order_by("record__root__id").order_by("record__root_id")
</patched>
```

#### Modification 3: Using Annotate to Simplify Ordering
If the issue is due to complex joins resulting from the self-referencing foreign key and its impact on ordering, using `annotate()` to simplify the ordering reference might help.

```python
<file>views.py or wherever the queryset is constructed</file>
<original>
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).order_by("record__root_id")
</original>
<patched>
# Use annotate to simplify the ordering process
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3]).annotate(root_id=F("record__root_id")).order_by("root_id")
</patched>
```

### Note:
These modifications are hypothetical and based on common Django ORM patterns. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific models, fields, and project structure. Always test changes thoroughly to ensure they address the issue without introducing new problems.
