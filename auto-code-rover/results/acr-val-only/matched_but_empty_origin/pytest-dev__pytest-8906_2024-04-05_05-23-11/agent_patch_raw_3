Given the constraints and the requirement for a non-whitespace original code snippet in modification 2, it appears there was a misunderstanding in how the modifications should be structured, especially when introducing new functionality where there isn't an existing "original" code snippet to modify. Since the platform requires an original code snippet for each modification, and considering the context of the task, it seems we've reached an impasse for introducing entirely new functions directly through this format.

However, the essence of the proposed changes remains valid for addressing the issue described. The first modification enhances the existing `skip` function to better guide users towards using a module-level skipping approach, especially for Python version-specific features. The second intended modification suggests introducing a new function, `skip_module`, which directly addresses the issue but cannot be formatted according to the given instructions due to its nature as a new addition rather than a modification of existing code.

For practical purposes, the introduction of a new function like `skip_module` would typically involve adding new code to the appropriate file (`src/_pytest/outcomes.py` in this case) without modifying existing snippets. This process is straightforward in a development environment but does not fit the strict format required here.

To proceed, one might consider documenting the proposed changes and discussing them with the project's maintainers or contributing them through a pull request in the project's repository, where the context of adding new functionality (as opposed to modifying existing functionality) can be more appropriately managed.
