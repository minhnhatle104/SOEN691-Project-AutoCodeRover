Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the request for modifications. Since the task is to add new functionality rather than modify existing code, specifying an exact original code snippet is not applicable. The goal is to introduce new methods to handle `Indexed` objects in both the `MathMLPresentationPrinter` and `MathMLContentPrinter` classes, which do not currently exist in the provided code snippets. Therefore, I will reformat the modifications to focus on the addition of these methods without specifying an original code snippet, as it's an addition rather than a modification of existing code.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathml.py</file>
<original># Addition of _print_Indexed method in MathMLPresentationPrinter class</original>
<patched>class MathMLPresentationPrinter(MathMLPrinterBase):
    ...
    def _print_Indexed(self, expr):
        \"\"\"Prints an Indexed object in Presentation MathML format.\"\"\"
        mrow = self.dom.createElement('mrow')
        mi = self.dom.createElement('mi')
        mi.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(expr.base.name))
        mrow.appendChild(mi)
        for idx in expr.indices:
            msub = self.dom.createElement('msub')
            msub.appendChild(mi.cloneNode(True))
            msub.appendChild(self._print(idx))
            mrow.appendChild(msub)
        return mrow
    ...
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathml.py</file>
<original># Addition of _print_Indexed method in MathMLContentPrinter class</original>
<patched>class MathMLContentPrinter(MathMLPrinterBase):
    ...
    def _print_Indexed(self, expr):
        \"\"\"Prints an Indexed object in Content MathML format.\"\"\"
        x = self.dom.createElement('apply')
        ci = self.dom.createElement('ci')
        ci.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(expr.base.name))
        x.appendChild(ci)
        for idx in expr.indices:
            x.appendChild(self._print(idx))
        return x
    ...
</patched>
```

These modifications are intended to introduce new functionality for handling `Indexed` objects in the MathML printers, which was not previously available. The descriptions have been adjusted to clarify that these are additions to the classes.
