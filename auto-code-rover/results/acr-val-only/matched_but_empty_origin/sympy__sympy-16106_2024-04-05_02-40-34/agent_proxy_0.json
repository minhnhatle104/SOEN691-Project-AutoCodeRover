            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `Indexed` object and `MathMLPrinter` class work, and how they interact with each other. The error occurs because the `Indexed` object is not iterable, which is a requirement in the `_print_Basic` method of the `MathMLPrinter` class. Let's gather more information about these components and the context in which the error occurs.\n\n1. **Search for the `Indexed` class**: This will help us understand the structure and methods of the `Indexed` class, which seems not to be iterable as expected by the `MathMLPrinter`.\n\n2. **Search for the `MathMLPrinter` class**: This will provide insight into how the `MathMLPrinter` is implemented, especially how it expects to handle objects and why it fails with `Indexed` objects.\n\n3. **Search for the `_print_Basic` method in the `MathMLPrinter` class**: Since the error occurs in this method, understanding its implementation will be crucial to identifying the cause of the issue and how to patch it.\n\n4. **Search for the `mathml` method**: Given that the error trace starts from the `mathml` function call, it would be useful to see its implementation and how it interacts with `MathMLPrinter`.\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue and how they interact, which is essential for devising a solution.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Indexed\")\nsearch_class(\"MathMLPrinter\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"_print_Basic\", \"MathMLPrinter\")\nsearch_method(\"mathml\")\n```"
