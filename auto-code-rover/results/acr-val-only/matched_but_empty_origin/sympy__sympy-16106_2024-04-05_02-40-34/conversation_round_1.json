        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we can start analyzing the context around the issue:\n\n1. **Indexed Class**: The `Indexed` class is found in `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`. It inherits from `Expr` and has several properties like `name`, `base`, `indices`, `rank`, `shape`, `ranges`, and methods related to differentiation and representation. Notably, it is marked as `is_Atom = True`, which suggests it's considered an atomic expression in the SymPy framework. This might be relevant because atomic expressions are usually not iterable, which aligns with the error encountered.\n\n2. **MathMLPrinter Class**: The search did not find a class named `MathMLPrinter`. However, the error traceback and the method search for `mathml` suggest that there are classes named `MathMLPresentationPrinter` and `MathMLContentPrinter` involved in printing MathML representations. The absence of `MathMLPrinter` might be due to a misunderstanding or an outdated reference in the error traceback. Instead, we should focus on `MathMLPresentationPrinter` and `MathMLContentPrinter` as they are likely the relevant classes for rendering MathML output.\n\n3. **_print_Basic Method**: Since the class `MathMLPrinter` was not found, we couldn't directly find the `_print_Basic` method within it. However, the error traceback suggests that this method is crucial in the process and fails when encountering an `Indexed` object. The method likely expects to iterate over the given expression's components, which doesn't work with `Indexed` objects marked as atoms.\n\n4. **mathml Method**: The `mathml` function is a gateway to generating MathML representations of expressions. It decides whether to use `MathMLPresentationPrinter` or `MathMLContentPrinter` based on the `printer` argument. This function is where the process starts, but the issue arises deeper in the printing process, specifically in handling `Indexed` objects.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nThe core of the issue seems to be the handling of `Indexed` objects by the MathML printing process. Since `Indexed` objects are considered atomic and not iterable, the printing process, which expects to iterate over an expression's components, fails. A potential solution would involve modifying the MathML printing classes (`MathMLPresentationPrinter` and `MathMLContentPrinter`) to correctly handle `Indexed` objects, possibly by adding a special case for them in the relevant printing methods.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into the implementations of `MathMLPresentationPrinter` and `MathMLContentPrinter` to understand how they handle different types of expressions and to devise a way to properly support `Indexed` objects."
