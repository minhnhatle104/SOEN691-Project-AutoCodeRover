Given the constraints and the nature of the task, which involves adding new methods to a class without modifying existing code, the format for submitting these changes needs to be adjusted. Since there's no specific "original" code to replace (we are adding new functionality), I'll present the modifications as additions to the `MCodePrinter` class, acknowledging that the format doesn't perfectly align with the instructions for cases where new code is being added rather than modifying existing code.

# Addition 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>// Add the following method to the MCodePrinter class</original>
<patched>    def _print_Derivative(self, expr):
        """Convert a Derivative instance to its Mathematica form.
        """
        return "D[%s]" % (self.stringify(expr.args, ", "))
</patched>
```

# Addition 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>// Add the following method to the MCodePrinter class</original>
<patched>    def _print_Float(self, expr):
        """Convert a Float instance to its Mathematica form, handling exponent notation.
        """
        res = str(expr)
        return res.replace('e', '*^')
</patched>
```

These additions are intended to be placed within the `MCodePrinter` class definition in the `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` file. They introduce new methods to handle printing of `Derivative` and `Float` objects in a manner consistent with Mathematica's syntax, addressing the issue described.
