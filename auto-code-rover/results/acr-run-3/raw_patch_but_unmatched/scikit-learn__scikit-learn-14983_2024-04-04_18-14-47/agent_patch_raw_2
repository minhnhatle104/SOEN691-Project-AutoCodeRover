Given the feedback and the context provided earlier, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach to directly modify the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. Since the `__repr__` method was not found in these classes or their base class `_RepeatedSplits`, but similar methods were found in other base classes (`BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseShuffleSplit`), a more appropriate approach would be to ensure that `_RepeatedSplits` either correctly inherits from a class that already has a suitable `__repr__` method or to implement a new `__repr__` method directly in `_RepeatedSplits` if inheritance is not an option or does not apply correctly.

However, based on the initial instructions and the error message indicating that the modifications could not be applied, it seems there might have been a mistake in the proposed solution. Since direct modifications to `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` were suggested but not applicable, let's revise the approach considering the structure and inheritance of the classes involved.

Given that no direct `__repr__` method exists in the classes of interest and considering the structure of the sklearn library, a more fitting solution would involve adding a `__repr__` method to the `_RepeatedSplits` base class, from which both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit. This method would then automatically apply to both classes without needing to modify each class individually.

Here's a revised approach, assuming we are to add the `__repr__` method to the `_RepeatedSplits` class:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/model_selection/_split.py</file>
<original>class _RepeatedSplits(BaseCrossValidator):
    def __init__(self, n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None):
        ...
</original>
<patched>class _RepeatedSplits(BaseCrossValidator):
    def __init__(self, n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None):
        ...
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})"
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that any class inheriting from `_RepeatedSplits` will have a meaningful `__repr__` method that reflects the class name and its initialization parameters. This approach is more aligned with the structure of the sklearn library and addresses the issue without needing to individually modify each affected class.
