Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the approach to directly modify specific classes or the base class with a `__repr__` method, especially since the original and patched code snippets provided did not directly match the existing codebase structure or were not applicable due to the structure of the provided instructions.

Since direct modifications to the `RepeatedKFold`, `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, or their base class `_RepeatedSplits` were suggested but could not be applied, and considering the actual structure of the sklearn library and the error messages indicating that the modifications could not match the original program, it's clear that a different approach or more precise instructions are needed to create a valid patch.

Without the ability to directly inspect and interact with the codebase or receive real-time feedback on the structure of the existing classes and methods beyond the provided snippets and search results, crafting a perfectly matching patch is challenging.

The intention was to implement a `__repr__` method that accurately represents instances of the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, including class parameters such as `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. The correct approach would involve adding this method in a way that aligns with the existing inheritance and method resolution order of the sklearn library's class hierarchy, specifically targeting the `_RepeatedSplits` base class or directly within the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes if that aligns better with the library's design principles.

Given the limitations and the feedback, I recommend consulting the sklearn library's contribution guidelines, existing class hierarchy, and possibly discussing with the project maintainers for guidance on the best way to introduce the `__repr__` method in a manner that is consistent with the library's architecture and contribution standards.
