        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes are defined in the same file `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py`. They inherit from a common base class `_RepeatedSplits`. The issue reported is that the `__repr__` method for both classes does not return the expected string representation, which should include the class name and the values of the parameters `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n\nGiven this context, the problem likely lies in the absence of a properly defined `__repr__` method for these classes or in the base class from which they inherit. To address this issue, we need to check if the `__repr__` method is implemented for these classes or their base class `_RepeatedSplits`. If it's not implemented or not implemented correctly, we will need to either add or modify this method to ensure it returns the expected string representation.\n\nThe next steps should involve:\n1. Checking the implementation of the `__repr__` method in both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes.\n2. If the `__repr__` method is not found in these classes, checking the base class `_RepeatedSplits` for the implementation of the `__repr__` method.\n3. Understanding how the `__repr__` method should be structured to return the desired output.\n\nLet's proceed with checking the `__repr__` method implementation in these classes and their base class."
