Given the constraints and the lack of direct access to specific parts of the Pytest codebase or the exact implementation details of the JUnit XML report generation, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on a general understanding of how such a feature might be implemented in Python. This patch assumes that there's a function responsible for generating the `<testsuite>` element of the JUnit XML report, and we'll enhance it to include `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes.

Please note, this is a conceptual solution crafted to illustrate how one might approach adding the desired attributes based on common Python practices and the information discussed. The actual implementation details in Pytest could differ significantly.

    hostname = socket.gethostname()
    timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    
    testsuite = ET.Element('testsuite')
    testsuite.set('errors', str(errors))
    testsuite.set('failures', str(failures))
    testsuite.set('skipped', str(skipped))
    testsuite.set('tests', str(tests))
    testsuite.set('time', str(time))
    testsuite.set('hostname', hostname)
    testsuite.set('timestamp', timestamp)
    return testsuite
</patched>
```

This modification assumes the existence of a function `generate_testsuite_element` responsible for creating the `<testsuite>` element in the XML report. The patch adds the `hostname` (using Python's `socket` module) and `timestamp` (using the `datetime` module) attributes to the element. 

Remember, the actual implementation in Pytest might involve different functions, modules, or methods for generating the JUnit XML report. Therefore, the provided patch serves as an illustrative example rather than a directly applicable solution. To implement such a feature in Pytest, one would need to identify the correct location in the codebase where the XML report is generated and apply a similar logic to include the additional attributes.
