I understand the constraints and the challenge presented by not having direct access to the specific implementation details within the Pytest codebase, especially regarding the generation of JUnit XML reports. Given this, and considering the nature of the task, it's clear that creating a direct and applicable patch without access to or knowledge of the exact code structure is not feasible.

In a real-world scenario, the steps to address the issue would involve:

1. **Locally cloning the Pytest repository**: This allows for a thorough examination of the codebase to identify where and how JUnit XML reports are generated.

2. **Identifying the relevant module or function**: Once the part of the code responsible for generating the XML reports is found, the next step would be to understand its implementation to see how best to introduce the `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes.

3. **Implementing the changes**: With the relevant sections identified, changes can be made to include the additional attributes in the XML output. This would likely involve importing Python's `socket` and `datetime` modules to retrieve the hostname and current timestamp, respectively, and modifying the XML generation logic to include these as attributes.

4. **Testing the changes**: It's crucial to ensure that the modifications do not break existing functionality and that the new attributes are correctly added to the XML reports. This would involve running the modified Pytest against a suite of tests and verifying the output.

5. **Submitting a pull request**: If the changes are deemed useful for others, contributing back to the Pytest project by submitting a pull request would be the final step. This would involve following the project's contribution guidelines, including providing a detailed description of the changes, any new dependencies, and the rationale behind the enhancement.

Without the ability to directly modify the code or execute search API calls to pinpoint the exact implementation details, I hope this conceptual overview provides some guidance on how one might approach adding `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes to JUnit XML reports generated by Pytest.
