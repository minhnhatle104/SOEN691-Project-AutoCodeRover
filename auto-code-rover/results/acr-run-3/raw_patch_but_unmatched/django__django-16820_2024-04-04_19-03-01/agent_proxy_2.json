The investigation into the `apply` method in `django/db/migrations/migration.py` provided insights into how migrations are applied but did not directly reveal how migrations are squashed or how the specific transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` is handled within the squashing process. Further detailed examination of the Django migrations framework's source code would be required to pinpoint the exact locations of the bug."
