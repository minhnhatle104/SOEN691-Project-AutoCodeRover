Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the Django migrations framework and without concrete code snippets that directly relate to the handling of `Meta.index_together` and `Meta.indexes` during the migration squashing process, it's challenging to provide a precise and actionable patch.

However, addressing the issue fundamentally involves enhancing the migration squashing logic to automatically transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` and ensure that any deprecation warnings related to `Meta.index_together` are appropriately handled or suppressed. This would likely require modifications at a deeper level within the Django migrations framework, potentially involving the logic that parses model Meta options during migration creation and squashing.

Since a direct patch cannot be formulated based on the provided context and without specific locations in the Django codebase where these transitions are handled, the best course of action would be to report this issue to the Django project's issue tracker, if not already done. This would allow the Django core developers, who have an intimate understanding of the migrations framework's internals, to address the issue in a manner consistent with the framework's architecture and design principles.

For anyone looking to contribute a fix for this issue, I recommend:

1. **Familiarizing with Django's Migrations Framework**: Gain a deep understanding of how migrations are created, applied, and especially squashed. The Django documentation and the source code for the migrations framework are excellent starting points.
2. **Understanding Deprecation Warnings**: Investigate how Django handles deprecation warnings, particularly in the context of migrations. This includes how warnings are generated and suppressed.
3. **Contributing to Django**: Consider engaging with the Django community through its official channels, such as the Django Developers mailing list or the Django project's GitHub repository. Proposing a change through a Django Enhancement Proposal (DEP) or a pull request, after thorough discussion and consensus, is the way forward.

This approach ensures that any changes are well-considered, align with Django's development practices, and have the support of the Django community.
