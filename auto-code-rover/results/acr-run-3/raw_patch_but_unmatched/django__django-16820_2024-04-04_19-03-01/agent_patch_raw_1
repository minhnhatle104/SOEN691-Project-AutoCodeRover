Given the context and the nature of the issue, a direct patch to address the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` and the removal of deprecation warnings during migration squashing cannot be precisely formulated without a deeper understanding of the Django migrations framework's internals. However, I can propose a conceptual approach to what such a patch might involve, based on the general understanding of the issue and the Django migrations system.

The issue at hand involves ensuring that when migrations are squashed, any usage of the deprecated `Meta.index_together` is transitioned to `Meta.indexes`, and any associated deprecation warnings are removed. This would likely involve modifying the migration squashing logic to detect `Meta.index_together` usage and convert it to `Meta.indexes` format.

Since we do not have specific methods or logic identified for handling the squashing process or for transitioning between these two Meta options, the following is a hypothetical patch that outlines a possible approach to solving the issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/migration.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for where we might expect to find logic related to handling
# Meta options during the migration apply process. The actual code needing modification
# would depend on where Django handles the specifics of squashing migrations and
# transitioning Meta options.
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patch to illustrate the concept of transitioning Meta.index_together
# to Meta.indexes during the migration squashing process.

def apply(self, project_state, schema_editor, collect_sql=False):
    """
    Take a project_state representing all migrations prior to this one
    and a schema_editor for a live database and apply the migration
    in a forwards order.

    Return the resulting project state for efficient reuse by following
    Migrations.
    """
    for operation in self.operations:
        # Detect and transition Meta.index_together to Meta.indexes
        if isinstance(operation, models.AlterModelOptions):
            if 'index_together' in operation.options:
                index_together = operation.options.pop('index_together')
                indexes = [models.Index(fields=list(fields), name='_'.join(fields) + '_idx') for fields in index_together]
                if 'indexes' in operation.options:
                    operation.options['indexes'].extend(indexes)
                else:
                    operation.options['indexes'] = indexes
                # Add logic to suppress deprecation warnings for this transition
                # This is a conceptual approach; actual implementation may vary
                # based on Django's warning handling system.

        # Existing logic continues here...
</patched>
```

This modification is purely illustrative and not based on actual Django internals for handling migration squashing or Meta option transitions. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the Django migration framework's handling of `Meta.index_together` and `Meta.indexes`, including where and how migrations are squashed and how Meta options are parsed and applied during this process.
