Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the actual Django codebase and specific lines of code, creating a precise patch is challenging. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to how a patch might be structured based on common Django development practices and the information provided. This conceptual patch is meant to illustrate the kind of changes that could be made to address the issue of `inspectdb` not generating `related_name` for fields that relate to the same model. Implementers would need to adapt this approach to the specific codebase and Django version they are working with.

Please note, the following is a hypothetical example and not directly applicable without modifications:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/related.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for where you might find the initialization or contribution of related fields.
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patch to automatically generate a related_name if not provided and the relation is to the same model.
def contribute_to_class(self, cls, name, **kwargs):
    if self.related_name is None and self.remote_field.model == cls.__name__:
        self.related_name = f"{cls.__name__.lower()}_{name}_rel"
    super().contribute_to_class(cls, name, **kwargs)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for where the logic to handle field definition during inspectdb operations might be located.
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical note to indicate where modifications could be made to ensure related_name generation logic is considered during inspectdb operations.
# Note: Actual implementation would depend on how inspectdb generates field definitions and might require a more nuanced approach.
</patched>
```

Given the hypothetical nature of these patches, it's crucial to review the actual Django source code for the versions you are working with to identify the correct locations for modifications. Additionally, thorough testing should be conducted to ensure that these changes do not introduce any regressions or conflicts, especially considering the dynamic nature of model relationships and the `related_name` attribute in Django.
