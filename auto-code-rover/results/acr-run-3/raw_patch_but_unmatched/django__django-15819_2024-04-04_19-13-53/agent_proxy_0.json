Specifically, we're interested in the part of the code that deals with generating model fields for relations (foreign keys, one-to-one fields, etc.) and how it currently handles or fails to handle the `related_name` attribute for relations pointing to the same entity. \n\nHere are the API calls I would make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method(\"inspectdb\")`: This will help us find where the `inspectdb` command is implemented in the codebase.\n2. `search_class(\"Model\")`: Since the issue mentions generating models and dealing with model fields, understanding how the `Model` class is defined and used could provide insights into possible places for the patch.\n3. `search_code(\"related_name\")`: This search could reveal how `related_name` attributes are currently handled or mentioned throughout the codebase, which could lead us to the relevant sections for generating or modifying these attributes."
