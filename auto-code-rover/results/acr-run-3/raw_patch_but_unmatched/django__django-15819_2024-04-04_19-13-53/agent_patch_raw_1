Given the issue described and the context retrieved, I'll provide a hypothetical patch to address the issue of `inspectdb` not generating `related_name` for fields that relate to the same model. This solution is based on the Django framework's structure and common practices as of my last update in 2023. Please note, actual file paths and code snippets might differ in the real Django codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/related.py</file>
<original>
def contribute_to_class(self, cls, name, **kwargs):
    ...
    if not cls._meta.abstract:
        ...
</original>
<patched>
def contribute_to_class(self, cls, name, private_only=False, **kwargs):
    ...
    # Auto-generate related_name to avoid clashes in self-referential models
    if self.related_name is None and cls.__name__ == self.remote_field.model:
        self.related_name = f"{cls.__name__.lower()}_{name}_related"
    if not cls._meta.abstract:
        ...
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py</file>
<original>
for i, row in enumerate(cursor.fetchall()):
    ...
    comment_notes.append('Field name made lowercase.')
</original>
<patched>
for i, row in enumerate(cursor.fetchall()):
    ...
    # Note added to indicate auto-generation of related_name for self-references
    comment_notes.append('Field name made lowercase. Related_name auto-generated for self-references.')
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are hypothetical and aim to illustrate a potential approach to solving the described issue. The first modification ensures that a `related_name` is auto-generated for self-referential fields when the `related_name` is not explicitly provided, avoiding clashes. The second modification adds a note in the `inspectdb` command output to inform users about the auto-generation of `related_name` for self-references, improving the command's usability and output clarity.

These patches would need to be tested thoroughly in the context of the Django project to ensure they do not introduce regressions or conflicts with existing functionality.
