Given the nature of the issue, which involves the inability to pickle objects due to the use of weak references in the label alignment process, a direct patch to the source code is challenging without a deeper understanding of the entire Matplotlib architecture and its design choices regarding the use of weak references. However, I can propose a conceptual approach to address the issue, focusing on the potential cause related to the `_align_label_groups` usage.

The core of the problem seems to be the inability to pickle objects that are only referenced weakly, as indicated by the error message. A possible solution could involve ensuring that objects involved in the alignment process are either not solely referenced weakly or providing a mechanism to reconstruct these references upon unpickling.

Since the actual implementation details and the usage of `_align_label_groups` are not fully disclosed in the provided context, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a conceptual approach rather than a definitive solution.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>
# This is a speculative original block, assuming `_align_label_groups` is defined and used like this:
self._align_label_groups['x'].join(ax, axc)
self._align_label_groups['y'].join(ax, axc)
</original>
<patched>
# Speculative patched block, introducing a mechanism to handle pickling issues:
class AlignLabelGroup:
    def __init__(self):
        self.groups = {'x': set(), 'y': set()}

    def join(self, axis, other_axis):
        if axis not in self.groups['x'] and axis not in self.groups['y']:
            # Assuming axis and other_axis are hashable and can be strongly referenced
            self.groups[axis.label_position].add((axis, other_axis))

    def __getstate__(self):
        # Custom method to support pickling, converting weak references to strong references or identifiers
        state = self.__dict__.copy()
        # Convert sets to a pickle-friendly format, if necessary
        return state

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        # Custom method to reconstruct the object upon unpickling
        self.__dict__.update(state)
        # Reconstruct sets from the pickle-friendly format, if necessary

# Assuming `_align_label_groups` is an instance of AlignLabelGroup or similar
self._align_label_groups = AlignLabelGroup()
self._align_label_groups.join(ax, axc)
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a hypothetical `AlignLabelGroup` class designed to manage label alignment groups in a way that is compatible with pickling. The `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods are placeholders for custom serialization and deserialization logic, which would need to be implemented based on the actual structure and requirements of the `_align_label_groups`.

Please note, this patch is speculative and serves to illustrate a potential approach. Actual implementation would require a thorough understanding of the Matplotlib codebase, including how axes and labels are managed and referenced throughout the library.
