Given the limitations and the feedback provided, it's clear that a direct application of edits or patches cannot be accurately formulated without specific access to the project's codebase or further details. My previous attempts aimed to provide a conceptual approach based on the general understanding of the issue described and common Django practices.

However, since a direct application of edits is required and considering the constraints, I'll provide a hypothetical patch in the requested format, though it's important to note that this patch is conceptual and based on the initial issue description. It may require adjustments to fit the actual code structure and specifics of the Django version used in the project.

```python
<file>urls.py</file>
<original>re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),</original>
<patched>from django.urls import path, re_path
urlpatterns = [
    path('module/', views.modules, {'format': 'html'}, name='modules'),
    re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))/$', views.modules, name='modules_format'),
]</patched>
```

```python
<file>views.py</file>
<original>def modules(request, format='html'):
    ...
    return render(...)</original>
<patched>def modules(request, format=None):
    if not format:
        format = 'html'
    ...
    return render(...)</patched>
```

### Explanation:
- **URL Configuration**: The `urlpatterns` in `urls.py` is modified to use both `path` and `re_path`. The `path` function is used for the default case where no format is specified, and `re_path` is used for cases where a format is specified. This approach separates the handling of the default format from other formats, making the URL patterns clearer and more explicit.
- **View Function**: The `modules` function in `views.py` is adjusted to handle `format` as an optional parameter. If `format` is not provided (i.e., `None`), it defaults to `'html'`. This change ensures that the view function can handle requests both with and without the format parameter, providing a default value when necessary.

Please note, this patch is based on a conceptual understanding of the issue and might need to be adapted to fit the specific project's implementation details and Django version nuances.
