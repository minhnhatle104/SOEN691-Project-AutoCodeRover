Given the issue description and the analysis conducted, the problem seems to stem from the handling of optional URL parameters in Django 3.0, specifically with the `re_path` usage and the `modules` view function. Since the search did not yield specific locations or definitions for the `modules` function or the exact URL pattern, I'll propose a generic patch based on the common practices and the issue described. This patch assumes the issue is related to the handling of optional URL parameters and their default values in view functions.

# modification 1
```python
<file>urls.py</file>
<original>re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),</original>
<patched>path('module/', views.modules, name='modules'),
path('module/<str:format>/', views.modules, name='modules_with_format'),</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>views.py</file>
<original>def modules(request, format='html'):
    ...
    return render(...)</original>
<patched>def modules(request, format=None):
    if format is None:
        format = 'html'
    ...
    return render(...)</patched>
```

Explanation:

1. **Modification 1**: This change in `urls.py` replaces the `re_path` with two `path` entries. The first entry handles the case where no format is provided, and the second handles cases where a format is specified. This approach simplifies the URL pattern and makes the optional parameter handling more explicit. The `path` function is preferred for straightforward URL patterns for better readability and maintainability.

2. **Modification 2**: In `views.py`, the `modules` function is modified to accept `format` as an optional parameter with a default value of `None`. Inside the function, a check is performed to set the format to `'html'` if it wasn't provided in the URL. This ensures that the function behaves correctly both when a format is specified and when it's not, aligning with the expected behavior described in the issue.

Please note, these modifications are based on the generic understanding of the issue as described and the common practices in handling URL parameters in Django. Depending on the specific project structure and requirements, further adjustments might be necessary.
