Specifically, we're looking for how it handles URL parameters and how it's called, to identify why it's receiving an unexpected number of arguments. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. **Search for the `modules` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us find all occurrences of the `modules` function, providing insight into its definition and any modifications or wrappers that might affect its argument handling.\n   \n   `search_method(\"modules\")`\n\n2. **Search for the URL configuration snippet in the codebase**: Since the issue mentions a specific URL pattern that seems to be causing the problem, finding all instances of this pattern could help us understand if there are any inconsistencies or changes in how URL parameters are passed to the view function.\n\n   `search_code(\"re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$'\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how the `modules` view function is integrated into the project and how URL parameters are expected to be handled, which is crucial for diagnosing the issue described."
