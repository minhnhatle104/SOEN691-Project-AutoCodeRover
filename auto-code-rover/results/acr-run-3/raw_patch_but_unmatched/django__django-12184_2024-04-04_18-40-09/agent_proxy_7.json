Given the constraints and the need to directly address the issue with valid search API calls, let's attempt a different approach to gather more context about the project based on the initial issue description. Here are the revised search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for any usage of `re_path` in the project**: This will help us find instances of URL patterns being defined, which could lead to discovering how optional URL parameters are handled across the project.\n\n   ```\n   search_code(\"re_path(\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the usage of `format` in URL patterns**: Since the issue involves an optional `format` parameter in the URL, finding its usage could provide insights into how it's expected to be handled.\n\n   ```\n   search_code(\"?P<format>\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the definition of the `modules` view function**: Although the initial search did not find the `modules` method, refining the search to look for its definition might yield better results.\n\n   ```\n   search_code(\"def modules(\")\n   ```\n\nThese search API calls are designed to gather more context about the usage of URL patterns, specifically the handling of optional parameters and the definition of the `modules` view function, which are central to the issue described."
