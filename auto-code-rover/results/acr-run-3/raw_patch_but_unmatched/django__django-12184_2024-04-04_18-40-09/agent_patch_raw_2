Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct application of a patch cannot be accurately formulated without specific access to the project's codebase or further details. However, based on the general understanding of the issue described and common Django practices, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the issue, which might need to be adapted to fit the actual code structure and Django version specifics.

Since the direct application of a patch is not feasible in this context, I recommend the following conceptual approach to resolve the issue related to optional URL parameters in Django views, which can be adapted to the project's specific implementation:

### Conceptual Approach to Resolve the Issue

1. **Refactor the URL Configuration**:
   - Transition from using `re_path` to `path` for clearer URL pattern definitions.
   - Explicitly define routes for both with and without the optional `format` parameter.

2. **Adjust the View Function**:
   - Modify the view function to handle the `format` parameter more robustly, providing a default value when it is not supplied in the URL.

This approach aims to simplify the handling of optional parameters and improve the readability and maintainability of the URL configuration and view functions.

### Example Adaptation

While I cannot provide a direct patch to the program without matching the original code, here's how the conceptual approach might be translated into code:

#### URLs Configuration (urls.py)
```python
# Assuming 'views.modules' is the view function intended to handle these routes.
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('module/', views.modules, name='modules_default'),
    path('module/<str:format>/', views.modules, name='modules_with_format'),
]
```

#### View Function (views.py)
```python
def modules(request, format=None):
    if not format:
        format = 'html'
    # Proceed with handling the request using the determined format
    ...
```

### Adaptation Notes:
- This example assumes the use of `path` for URL patterns, which is recommended for straightforward patterns in newer Django versions.
- The view function `modules` is adapted to provide a default value for `format` when it is not specified, aligning with the described issue.

Please adapt these conceptual suggestions to fit the specific patterns, conventions, and requirements of your Django project.
