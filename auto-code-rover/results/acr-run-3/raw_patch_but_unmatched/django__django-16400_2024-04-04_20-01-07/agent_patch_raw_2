Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of the solution without direct access to the specific implementation details of the `TenantDatabaseRouter`, it's challenging to provide an exact patch that matches the original program. However, I can offer a general approach to address the issue based on common Django practices and the insights gained from the analysis.

The core issue seems to be that the custom database router does not respect the database parameter when running migrations, particularly for operations like adding permissions. A common cause for such behavior is the router's methods not correctly handling the database parameter or hints provided by Django's migration framework.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch that matches the original program, I recommend reviewing and updating the custom `TenantDatabaseRouter` with the following considerations in mind:

1. **Ensure `allow_migrate` respects the database parameter**: This method should check if the `db` parameter matches the intended database for the migration. If your project uses a method like `_default_db()` to determine the target database based on some logic (e.g., tenant subdomains), ensure that `allow_migrate` compares `db` against this method's return value.

2. **Handle database hints in `db_for_read` and `db_for_write`**: These methods should consider any database hints provided. If a hint specifies a particular database, that should override the default logic for selecting the database.

3. **Test with specific database parameters**: After making changes, test the `migrate` command with the `--database` parameter to ensure that migrations correctly target the specified database, and no unintended database access occurs.

Without specific code snippets from the `TenantDatabaseRouter`, these recommendations are meant to guide the troubleshooting and patching process. Review the custom router's implementation for `allow_migrate`, `db_for_read`, and `db_for_write` methods, and adjust them to ensure they respect the database parameter and hints appropriately.
