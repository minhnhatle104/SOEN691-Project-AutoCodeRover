Given the limitations and the inability to directly access or modify the specific implementation of the `TenantDatabaseRouter` and without concrete original code snippets to match against, providing a precise patch is not feasible in this context. 

However, the guidance offered aims to address the core issue described: ensuring that the custom database router respects the database parameter throughout the migration process, especially when adding permissions. This involves careful consideration and potentially revising the `allow_migrate`, `db_for_read`, and `db_for_write` methods within the custom router to ensure they properly handle the database parameter and any relevant hints.

For developers facing similar issues, the recommended approach involves:

1. **Reviewing the custom database router's logic** to ensure it aligns with Django's expectations for database routers, particularly in the context of migrations.
2. **Ensuring that database routing methods (`allow_migrate`, `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`) are implemented** in a way that respects the `db` parameter and any hints provided by Django's migration framework.
3. **Testing extensively** with different configurations and database parameters to confirm that the migrations behave as expected across different databases.

Without the ability to apply a direct patch, these steps serve as a conceptual guide to resolving the issue based on the described problem and the insights gained from Django's documentation and the analysis of similar implementations within Django's test suite.
