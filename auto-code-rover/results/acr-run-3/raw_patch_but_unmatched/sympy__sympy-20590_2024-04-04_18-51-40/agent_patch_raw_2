Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch to address the issue as described cannot be accurately formulated without further insights into the changes between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7, especially regarding the inheritance chain or internal Python behavior changes that might affect `__slots__` and `__dict__`.

The provided code for the `Symbol` class in `sympy/core/symbol.py` does not show any direct cause for the introduction of `__dict__` in instances, as it correctly defines `__slots__` to prevent this. The issue likely lies in subtler changes or interactions not visible in the snippet provided.

Without additional context or the ability to inspect changes in superclass definitions or other related parts of the codebase, proposing a specific code patch is not feasible. The resolution would require a detailed examination of the entire inheritance chain, any changes made to the handling of `__slots__` and `__dict__` in the transition from version 1.6.2 to 1.7, and potentially the impact of Python version changes on these behaviors.

For users or developers encountering similar issues, the recommended approach would involve:

1. Reviewing the changelog and commit history between the affected versions for relevant changes.
2. Inspecting the definitions and modifications of parent classes to `Symbol` for changes in `__slots__` handling or unintended introduction of `__dict__`.
3. Testing with different Python versions to identify if the change in behavior is influenced by the Python runtime itself.

Given the limitations in providing a direct patch without further context, it's essential to approach the resolution through comprehensive codebase review and version control history analysis.
