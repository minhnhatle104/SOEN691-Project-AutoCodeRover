Based on the issue description and the provided context, the problem seems to stem from the fact that `Symbol` instances in version 1.7 unexpectedly have a `__dict__` attribute, despite explicitly defining `__slots__` with only a 'name' entry. This behavior suggests that somewhere in the inheritance chain or in the class definition itself, there might be an introduction of `__dict__` or a change that allows its creation.

However, from the provided code snippet of the `Symbol` class, there's no direct evidence of a change that would introduce `__dict__` to `Symbol` instances. The class correctly defines `__slots__`, which should prevent the automatic creation of `__dict__` for instances of the class.

Given this, and without evidence of changes in the inheritance chain (i.e., the parent classes `AtomicExpr` and `Boolean`) that could introduce `__dict__`, the issue might not be directly resolvable through a simple patch to the `Symbol` class definition as provided. It's possible that the issue arises from a more complex interaction within the Python runtime or a change in the behavior of the superclass constructors or initializers that isn't directly visible in the `Symbol` class code.

Without specific evidence pointing to a bug in the provided `Symbol` class code or detailed insights into changes in the superclass definitions between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7, proposing a direct patch is challenging. A proper resolution would likely involve a deeper dive into the inheritance chain and possibly adjustments in the superclass definitions to ensure they respect the `__slots__` definition in subclasses, preventing the creation of `__dict__`.

For educational purposes, if we were to hypothesize a patch based on a common scenario where a superclass might introduce `__dict__`, a preventive measure could be to reinforce the `__slots__` definition in the `Symbol` class by explicitly setting it to an empty tuple in the superclass, assuming that's where the issue originated. This is purely speculative and serves as an example of how one might approach a similar issue if the cause were known.

# Hypothetical modification (educational purpose only)
```python
<file>sympy/core/symbol.py</file>
<original>class Symbol(AtomicExpr, Boolean):
    __slots__ = ('name',)
</original>
<patched>class Symbol(AtomicExpr, Boolean):
    __slots__ = ('name',)

    # Hypothetical patch to ensure no __dict__ is created
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        for cls in self.__class__.__mro__:
            if '__dict__' in cls.__dict__:
                raise TypeError(f"{cls.__name__} should not introduce __dict__ when __slots__ is defined in subclasses.")
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a runtime check to prevent the creation of `__dict__` in a scenario where a superclass might not respect the `__slots__` definition. Again, this is speculative and not based on direct evidence from the provided context. The actual resolution would require a more thorough investigation into the class hierarchy and changes between the specified versions.
