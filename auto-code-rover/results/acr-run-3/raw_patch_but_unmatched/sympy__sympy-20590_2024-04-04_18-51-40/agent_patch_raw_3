Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be provided without additional context or insight into the broader codebase and its evolution between versions. The issue as described suggests a nuanced interaction between Python's class mechanics (`__slots__` and `__dict__`) and the library's implementation, which isn't directly evident from the provided `Symbol` class definition.

Without the ability to trace the exact cause of the issue through version differences or deeper inspection into related classes and their inheritance chain, any attempt to provide a patch would be speculative and potentially misleading.

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue would involve:

1. **Version Control Comparison**: Directly comparing the `Symbol` class and its parent classes between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7 using version control tools to identify any changes that could lead to the introduction of `__dict__` in `Symbol` instances.

2. **Python Version Impact Analysis**: Considering the impact of the Python version itself, as changes in Python's handling of `__slots__` and class attribute management across versions could potentially influence this behavior.

3. **Library Documentation and Community Resources**: Consulting the library's changelog, documentation, and community forums or issue trackers for insights into known issues or intentional changes in behavior between versions.

Given these considerations and the limitations of the current interaction model, I must clarify that without the ability to perform these actions or access additional detailed context, providing a specific code patch is not feasible. The resolution to the issue described would require a targeted investigation by the project maintainers or developers with access to the full codebase and its version history.
