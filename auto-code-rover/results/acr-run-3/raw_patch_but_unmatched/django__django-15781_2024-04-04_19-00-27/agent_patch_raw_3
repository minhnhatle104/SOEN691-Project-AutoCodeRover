Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without more specific insights into the handling of multiline help text by the `DjangoHelpFormatter`. The provided information does not pinpoint a specific line or method implementation that directly causes the issue, making it challenging to propose a precise code modification.

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue would likely involve a deeper dive into how the formatter processes and displays help text, potentially requiring a review of the entire `DjangoHelpFormatter` class and related mechanisms in Django's command management framework. This would be aimed at identifying and rectifying the specific handling or lack thereof of multiline help text formatting.

Given the limitations, I'm unable to provide a valid patch without further context or more detailed insights into the implementation of the `DjangoHelpFormatter` and its interaction with help text formatting.
