Given the limitations and the context provided, it appears there's a misunderstanding in directly addressing the issue with a specific patch, especially since the detailed implementations of `add_usage` and `add_arguments` methods in the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class do not directly manipulate the help text in a way that would cause or fix the issue described.

Since the issue revolves around the preservation of multiline help text formatting and no direct modifications within the provided methods seem to address this, a speculative approach to ensure better handling of multiline descriptions would involve enhancing or ensuring the formatter respects such formatting. However, without specific lines of code that are causing the issue or more detailed insight into how the `DjangoHelpFormatter` processes and displays help text, proposing a direct patch is challenging.

Given the provided context and the nature of the issue, it's clear that the solution involves ensuring that multiline help text is correctly formatted and displayed, but without more specific details on the mechanism that leads to the formatting being lost or altered, a precise patch cannot be accurately formulated.

In real-world scenarios, the next steps would involve:

1. Reviewing the full implementation of `DjangoHelpFormatter`, especially methods that handle text formatting and output, to identify where exactly the handling of multiline text might be improved.
2. Testing with different help text formats to see how the current implementation affects their output.
3. Consulting Django's documentation or source code regarding custom help formatter behavior to identify recommended practices for preserving multiline text formatting.

This approach would provide a more informed basis for developing a patch that addresses the issue effectively.
