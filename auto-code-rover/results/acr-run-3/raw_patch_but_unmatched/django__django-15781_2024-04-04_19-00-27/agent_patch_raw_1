Given the context and the issue at hand, it seems the primary concern is not directly addressed by the `add_usage` and `add_arguments` methods as they are currently implemented. These methods primarily delegate to the superclass while applying a reordering of actions. The issue described relates to the formatting of multiline help text, which these methods do not explicitly manipulate.

However, since the problem is about preserving the formatting of multiline help text in management commands, and given that no direct bug in the provided methods' implementations stands out as the cause, the patch might need to focus on ensuring that the `DjangoHelpFormatter` or related mechanisms correctly handle and preserve multiline text formatting.

Without a clear bug in the provided method implementations and without more specific details on how the `DjangoHelpFormatter` processes help text, a hypothetical patch might involve enhancing the formatter to respect and preserve newline characters in the command's help text. Since the actual handling of the help text formatting is not fully detailed in the provided context, the following is a speculative approach to address the concern:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/management/base.py</file>
<original>class DjangoHelpFormatter(HelpFormatter):
    ...
</original>
<patched>class DjangoHelpFormatter(HelpFormatter):
    def _split_lines(self, text, width):
        """
        Override the _split_lines method to handle multiline help texts.
        This method will be called by the formatter when it encounters
        newline characters in the help text.
        """
        lines = []
        for line in text.splitlines():
            # Split the line more intelligently to preserve user formatting.
            wrapped_lines = super()._split_lines(line, width)
            lines.extend(wrapped_lines)
        return lines
    ...
</patched>
```

This modification hypothesizes the addition of a `_split_lines` method override in the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class. The `_split_lines` method is a common method in formatters that handle text wrapping. By overriding this method, we can customize how lines are split, particularly to ensure that explicit newline characters in the help text are respected and preserved, allowing for multiline help text to maintain its intended formatting.

Please note, this patch is speculative and assumes that the `DjangoHelpFormatter` either directly uses or can benefit from an override of the `_split_lines` method, which is a pattern seen in text formatting in Python's `argparse` module. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full behavior of `DjangoHelpFormatter` and how it interacts with the rest of the Django management command framework.
