Given the context and the issue described, the problem seems to stem from the absence of a specific method to handle the printing of tuples, especially single-element tuples, in a way that respects Python's syntax. Since the `PythonCodePrinter` and `AbstractPythonCodePrinter` classes do not explicitly define a method for handling tuples, we can introduce a method to handle tuples correctly. This method would ensure that single-element tuples include the necessary comma.

Since the detailed implementation of such a method was not directly provided in the retrieved context, the following patch is a conceptual solution that introduces a `_print_Tuple` method to the `PythonCodePrinter` class. This method checks the length of the tuple and formats it accordingly, ensuring that single-element tuples are correctly represented with a trailing comma.

```python

<original>
# Since there was no original _print_Tuple method, there's no original code snippet to replace.
</original>
<patched>
class PythonCodePrinter(AbstractPythonCodePrinter):
    ...
    def _print_Tuple(self, expr):
        \"\"\"Print tuples correctly, ensuring single-element tuples include a comma.\"\"\"
        # Convert all tuple elements to their string representation
        elements = [self._print(element) for element in expr]
        if len(elements) == 1:
            # For single-element tuples, add a comma to correctly represent them in Python
            return '({},)'.format(elements[0])
        else:
            return '({})'.format(', '.join(elements))
    ...
</patched>
```

This patch introduces a method to handle tuple expressions specifically, ensuring that the Python code printer correctly formats single-element tuples with a trailing comma. It's a conceptual solution based on the provided context and the nature of the issue. Further testing and integration would be required to ensure compatibility and correctness within the SymPy codebase.
