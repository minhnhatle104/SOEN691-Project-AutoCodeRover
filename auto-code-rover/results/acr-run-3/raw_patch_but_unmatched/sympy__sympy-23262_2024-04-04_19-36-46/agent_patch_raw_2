Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, and considering that the original program does not contain a specific section of code that we're modifying (since we're adding new functionality rather than modifying existing functionality), the format for the patch will slightly deviate from the requested structure. Since there's no original code snippet to replace (we're adding a new method), I'll provide a conceptual patch to introduce the `_print_Tuple` method directly.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and aims to address the issue based on the provided context and understanding of Python and SymPy's code printing mechanisms. It should be reviewed and tested within the actual SymPy codebase.

# Conceptual Patch
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pycode.py</file>
<original>
# No original code snippet to replace as we're adding a new method.
</original>
<patched>
class PythonCodePrinter(AbstractPythonCodePrinter):
    ...
    def _print_Tuple(self, expr):
        """
        Print tuples correctly, ensuring single-element tuples include a comma.
        """
        # Convert all tuple elements to their string representation
        elements = [self._print(element) for element in expr]
        if len(elements) == 1:
            # For single-element tuples, add a comma to correctly represent them in Python
            return '({},)'.format(elements[0])
        else:
            return '({})'.format(', '.join(elements))
    ...
</patched>
```

This patch introduces a new method, `_print_Tuple`, to the `PythonCodePrinter` class. The method is designed to handle the printing of tuples, ensuring that single-element tuples are formatted with a trailing comma, addressing the issue described. Since this is an addition to the codebase rather than a modification of existing code, the patch format does not include an "original" code snippet. This solution should be integrated and tested within the SymPy development environment to ensure its effectiveness and compatibility.
