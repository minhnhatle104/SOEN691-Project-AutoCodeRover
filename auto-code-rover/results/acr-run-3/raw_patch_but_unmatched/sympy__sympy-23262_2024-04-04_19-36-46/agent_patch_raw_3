Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears there's a misunderstanding in the request due to the nature of the task. Since the task involves adding new functionality to address an issue in a hypothetical scenario, and there's no direct "original" code to modify, the provided solution conceptualizes the addition of a new method to handle the printing of tuples in the `PythonCodePrinter` class within the SymPy library. 

However, as per the instructions and the format required, it's clear that the system expects modifications to existing code snippets, which doesn't align with the proposed solution of adding a new method where none existed before. 

Given these constraints and the nature of the task, it's important to note that the proposed solution is intended as a conceptual patch to illustrate how one might address the issue within the SymPy codebase, specifically by ensuring that single-element tuples are printed with a trailing comma to maintain correct Python syntax. 

This scenario highlights the importance of understanding the context and limitations of automated systems and the challenges in conveying modifications to hypothetical or abstract codebases without direct interaction with the actual source code.
