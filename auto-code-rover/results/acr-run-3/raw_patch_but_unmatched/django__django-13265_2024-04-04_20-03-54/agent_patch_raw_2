Given the constraints and the nature of the interaction, I provided a hypothetical example to illustrate how one might address the issue based on the description and the general practices within Django migrations. However, since I cannot access the actual migration file or the specific codebase, creating a precise patch that directly applies to your program is beyond my current capabilities.

The essence of the solution involves ensuring that the database schema is prepared (i.e., the `_order` field is properly established by Django's migration system) before attempting to add an index to it. This typically means adjusting the sequence of operations in your Django migration file.

Since a direct patch cannot be applied without specific details, I recommend the following steps to manually address the issue in your project:

1. **Locate the Migration File**: Identify the migration file within your Django app that attempts to add an index to the `_order` field. The filename will typically follow Django's naming convention for migration files (e.g., `000X_some_description.py`).

2. **Adjust the Sequence of Operations**: Within the identified migration file, ensure that any operation that establishes or modifies the `_order` field (this could be an operation that implicitly handles `order_with_respect_to`) is placed before the `AddIndex` operation that targets the `_order` field.

3. **Manually Create a New Migration If Necessary**: If the sequence of operations across multiple migration files is the issue, you may need to create a new migration file that explicitly adjusts the database schema as needed before adding the index. Use Django's `makemigrations` command with appropriate flags to create a skeleton migration file, then manually edit it to adjust the schema.

4. **Test Thoroughly**: After making adjustments, apply the migration in a development environment to ensure it works as expected. Use Django's `migrate` command to apply the migration, and verify that the index is added to the `_order` field without errors.

5. **Consult Django Documentation**: Review the [Django documentation on migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/migrations/) for additional guidance on creating and modifying migration files, especially sections related to operations order and dependencies between migrations.

By following these steps, you should be able to manually resolve the issue in your project's migration system. Remember, the key is to ensure the correct sequence of operations within your migration files to maintain the integrity of your database schema and avoid errors during migration application.
