Given the limitations of our interaction and the inability to directly access or modify your project's codebase, I'm unable to provide a precise patch that directly corresponds to your specific migration files or the Django project structure. My guidance and the hypothetical patch example were intended to illustrate a general approach to resolving the issue based on common Django migration practices and the nature of the problem as described.

To address the issue within the constraints of this platform and without access to the actual code, the best course of action is to manually review and adjust your Django migration files based on the principles outlined:

1. **Ensure Proper Sequence in Migration Files**: The core of the issue is the sequence of operations in the Django migration system, particularly regarding the `_order` field and the `AddIndex` operation. The migration operation that establishes or modifies the `_order` field must precede any `AddIndex` operations that involve this field.

2. **Manual Review and Adjustment**: Locate the migration file(s) for the `LookImage` model and review the sequence of operations. If an `AddIndex` operation on the `_order` field precedes the establishment or modification of the `_order` field, adjust the sequence accordingly.

3. **Consult Django Documentation and Community Resources**: For specific guidance on creating and modifying migration files, including handling of `order_with_respect_to` and indexing, the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/migrations/) is an invaluable resource. Additionally, the Django community, including forums and Q&A sites like Stack Overflow, can provide insights and solutions for similar issues.

4. **Testing After Adjustments**: Thoroughly test the adjusted migration in a development environment to ensure that the issue is resolved. Pay close attention to the application of the migration and the behavior of the database schema, especially regarding the `_order` field and the newly added index.

Without the ability to provide a direct patch, these recommendations aim to guide you through identifying and resolving the issue based on Django's migration framework and the details of the problem as described.
