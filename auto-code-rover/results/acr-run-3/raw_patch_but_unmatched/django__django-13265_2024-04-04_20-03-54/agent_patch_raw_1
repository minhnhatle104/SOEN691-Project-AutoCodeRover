Given the nature of the issue described, which involves the sequence of operations in a Django migration file related to `order_with_respect_to` and indexing of the `_order` field, a hypothetical patch would involve adjusting the migration file to ensure that the `AddIndex` operation for the `_order` field occurs after the field is properly established. Since I don't have access to the actual migration file or the specific codebase, I'll provide a generic example based on the typical structure of Django migration files.

Please note, the actual file path and code snippets would depend on your specific Django project structure and the migration file that introduced the issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>your_project/app_name/migrations/XXXX_auto_migration.py</file>
<original>
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),
),
migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
    name='lookimage',
    order_with_respect_to='look',
),
</original>
<patched>
migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
    name='lookimage',
    order_with_respect_to='look',
),
migrations.AddIndex(
    model_name='lookimage',
    index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),
),
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the original migration file attempted to add an index to the `_order` field before ensuring the field was properly established through the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation. The patch reverses the order of these operations, ensuring that the `_order` field is established first, which should resolve the issue.

Remember, this is a hypothetical example. The actual modification would need to be tailored to the specific migration file and sequence of operations causing the issue in your project. Additionally, if the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation does not directly apply or exist as described (since it was not found in the initial search), the concept still applies: ensure that any operation that relies on the existence or specific state of the `_order` field occurs after the field is properly established or modified to support `order_with_respect_to`.
