Given the context and the issue described, a precise patch cannot be provided without seeing the specific implementation details of how `Product` instances are formatted within the pretty-printing system of SymPy. However, I can outline a hypothetical approach to address the concerns raised in the issue:

1. **Reduce the width of the product symbol (∏) and remove the unnecessary empty line at the bottom.**
2. **Optionally, extend the top bar if it improves the visual appearance.**

Since the exact implementation details for formatting `Product` instances are not provided, the following modifications are speculative and aim to illustrate the kind of changes that might be made in the `PrettyPrinter` class or a similar component responsible for handling `Product` objects.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet for formatting Product instances
def _format_Product(self, expr):
    parts = ["∞", "┬───┬", "│   │ expr", "│   │", "n = start"]
    return "\n".join(parts)
</original>
<patched>
# Updated code snippet with reduced width and removed empty line
def _format_Product(self, expr):
    parts = ["∞", "─┬─┬─", "│ │ expr", "n = start"]
    return "\n".join(parts)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code for handling unicode settings
use_unicode = pp._settings['use_unicode']
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure that the use_unicode setting is considered when formatting
use_unicode = pp._settings.get('use_unicode', True)  # Default to True if not specified
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are illustrative and based on assumptions about the code structure. The actual implementation would require access to the specific methods responsible for formatting `Product` instances, which might involve modifying the `_print` method or a similar method tailored for `Product` objects within the `PrettyPrinter` class or related utility functions in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`.
