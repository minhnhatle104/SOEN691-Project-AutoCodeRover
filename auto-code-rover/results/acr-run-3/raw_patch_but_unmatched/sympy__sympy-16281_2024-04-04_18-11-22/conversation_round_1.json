Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we have identified the `Product` class within the `sympy/concrete/products.py` file. This class seems to be a part of the SymPy library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. The `Product` class represents the product of a sequence of terms, and it inherits from `ExprWithIntLimits`, indicating it deals with expressions that have integral limits.\n\nHowever, the search for a method named `pprint` directly within the codebase did not yield any results. This suggests that the pretty-printing functionality for the `Product` class (and possibly other classes) is not implemented directly within the methods of the class itself but is likely handled by a separate pretty-printing mechanism or utility within the SymPy library or its dependencies.\n\nGiven that the issue is specifically about improving the pretty-printing output of the `Product` class, and considering that the direct search for `pprint` did not return any results, it's reasonable to infer that the pretty-printing functionality is handled elsewhere. SymPy typically uses a pretty-printing system that works across various mathematical objects, not just one.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into how SymPy's pretty-printing system works. This involves understanding where the pretty-printing logic is implemented and how it interacts with different mathematical objects like `Product`. Since the direct search for `pprint` was not fruitful, we might need to look into modules or utilities related to pretty-printing within SymPy, or investigate how the `Product` class's output is formatted for pretty-printing.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps could involve searching for pretty-printing utilities or mechanisms within SymPy that handle the formatting of objects like `Product`. This could include looking into modules related to output formatting, pretty-printing, or even the general mechanism SymPy uses to convert mathematical objects into their string representations for display."
