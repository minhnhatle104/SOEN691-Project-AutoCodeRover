Given the limitations and the abstract nature of the task without direct access to the specific implementation details within the SymPy codebase, creating a precise and applicable patch is not feasible in this context. My previous responses aimed to provide a conceptual approach to how one might think about addressing the issue based on the information available and general programming practices.

To effectively address the issue described, a developer would need to:

1. **Identify the specific method(s) responsible for pretty-printing `Product` instances** within the SymPy library, likely within the `sympy/printing/pretty` directory or related files. This could involve methods that directly handle `Product` objects or more generic methods that are used across various types of expressions.

2. **Understand the current implementation** to pinpoint why the pretty-printing output includes an unnecessary empty line, why the product symbol (‚àè) is considered too wide, and how the top bar could be optionally extended.

3. **Modify the implementation** to adjust the formatting according to the feedback provided in the issue. This could involve adjusting the layout logic, changing how spaces and lines are added to the output, and possibly introducing new settings to control the appearance of the pretty-printed output more finely.

Without direct access to the code and specific details about the methods involved, I cannot provide a concrete patch. Addressing the issue effectively requires hands-on access to the SymPy codebase, specifically the parts that handle pretty-printing.
