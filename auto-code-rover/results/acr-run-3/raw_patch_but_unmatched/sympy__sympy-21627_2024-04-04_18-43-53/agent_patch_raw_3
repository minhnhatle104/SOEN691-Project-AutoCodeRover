Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be provided without access to the actual implementation details and without a deeper understanding of the internal architecture of the SymPy library. The recursion error described in the issue likely stems from complex interactions within the library's expression simplification and evaluation mechanisms, particularly involving trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.

However, I can suggest a general approach that developers of the SymPy library or similar projects might consider when dealing with recursion depth errors, especially in the context of symbolic mathematics libraries where expressions can become deeply nested.

### General Approach to Mitigating Recursion Depth Errors

1. **Limit Recursion Depth**: Implement a mechanism to track and limit recursion depth within the functions that evaluate or simplify expressions. This could involve passing a depth counter through recursive calls and checking against a maximum allowed depth.

2. **Expression Simplification**: Before entering deep recursive function calls, apply heuristic-based simplifications to the expression that may reduce its complexity and thus the depth of recursion needed for evaluation.

3. **Iterative Algorithms**: Where possible, refactor recursive algorithms to use iterative approaches. Many recursive algorithms can be rewritten iteratively, which can help avoid hitting the recursion depth limit.

4. **Tail Recursion Optimization**: In cases where tail recursion is used and the language or interpreter does not automatically optimize tail calls, manually optimize these to avoid unnecessary stack depth increases.

5. **User-Controlled Parameters**: Provide users with parameters to control the depth of recursion or the complexity of expressions being evaluated, allowing them to avoid recursion depth errors in exchange for less thorough simplification or evaluation.

### Conceptual Example

While a specific patch cannot be provided, below is a conceptual example of how one might begin to implement a depth-limiting mechanism in a recursive function within the SymPy library. Note that this is a high-level example and not directly applicable to any specific part of the SymPy codebase.

```python
def evaluate_expression(expr, depth=0):
    MAX_DEPTH = 100  # Example maximum depth
    
    if depth > MAX_DEPTH:
        raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth exceeded")
    
    # Example base case
    if expr.is_number:
        return expr
    
    # Hypothetical recursive case
    depth += 1
    return evaluate_expression(simplified_sub_expression(expr), depth)
```

This example illustrates a pattern that could be adapted and applied within the actual implementation of expression evaluation or simplification functions in SymPy to help mitigate recursion depth errors. Actual implementation would require careful consideration of the specific logic and architecture of the library, as well as extensive testing to ensure that changes do not adversely affect the library's functionality or performance.
