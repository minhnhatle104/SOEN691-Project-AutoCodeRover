Given the context and the issue described, it seems the recursion error arises from the handling of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, particularly `cosh` and `acos`, when evaluating expressions to determine if they are zero. The provided code snippets and analysis suggest that the issue might not be with a simple bug fix but rather with how complex expressions are simplified and evaluated.

However, without specific details on the internal workings of the simplification or evaluation logic that leads to the recursion error, proposing a precise patch is challenging. Still, I can suggest a general approach that could be taken to mitigate such recursion depth issues in symbolic computation libraries like SymPy.

A common strategy to handle cases where recursion depth might be exceeded is to introduce checks that limit the recursion depth or simplify the expression before it leads to deep recursion. Below is a hypothetical patch that introduces a recursion depth limit for the simplification process. This is a conceptual patch and might not directly apply to the SymPy codebase without modifications.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py</file>
<original>def eval(cls, arg):
    ...
    if arg.func == acosh:
        x = arg.args[0]
        return sqrt(x - 1) * sqrt(x + 1)</original>
<patched>def eval(cls, arg, depth=0):
    ...
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth exceeded")
    if arg.func == acosh:
        x = arg.args[0]
        return sqrt(x - 1, depth=depth+1) * sqrt(x + 1, depth=depth+1)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py</file>
<original>def eval(cls, arg):
    ...
    if arg.func == acos:
        x = arg.args[0]
        return sqrt(1 - x**2)</original>
<patched>def eval(cls, arg, depth=0):
    ...
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth exceeded")
    if arg.func == acos:
        x = arg.args[0]
        return sqrt(1 - x**2, depth=depth+1)</patched>
```

Please note, the `depth` parameter and `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` constant are hypothetical and would need to be properly integrated into the SymPy framework. This approach aims to provide a safeguard against excessive recursion by tracking the depth of recursive calls and halting further recursion once a certain threshold is reached. 

This solution is more of a conceptual approach to illustrate how one might begin to address recursion depth issues in a complex symbolic computation library. Actual implementation would require a thorough understanding of the library's architecture and possibly a more nuanced approach to handling specific cases that lead to deep recursion.
