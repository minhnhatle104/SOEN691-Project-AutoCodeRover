Given the limitations and the nature of the issue described, it's clear that a direct patch may not be feasible without a deeper understanding of the internal logic and architecture of the SymPy library, especially since the provided snippets and context do not directly point to a specific line or method that causes the recursion error. 

However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to mitigate recursion depth issues in symbolic computation, which could be adapted to the specific architecture of SymPy or similar libraries. This approach involves adding a mechanism to detect deep recursion and simplify expressions before they lead to a `RecursionError`. 

Since the direct application of a patch is not feasible without matching the original program's structure, I'll outline a general strategy that could be considered by developers facing similar issues:

### Conceptual Strategy for Handling Deep Recursion

1. **Implement Recursion Depth Tracking**: Enhance the expression evaluation functions to track the depth of recursion. This could be done by passing an additional parameter (e.g., `depth`) that increments with each recursive call.

2. **Define a Recursion Depth Limit**: Establish a maximum recursion depth limit. If the depth exceeds this limit, the function could either raise a custom exception or attempt to simplify the expression using a different strategy.

3. **Simplify Expressions Preemptively**: For expressions known to potentially cause deep recursion (e.g., involving complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions), implement preemptive simplification strategies that reduce the expression complexity before deep recursion occurs.

4. **Optimize Recursive Algorithms**: Review and optimize existing recursive algorithms to minimize unnecessary recursive calls. This could involve using memoization techniques or converting recursive algorithms to iterative ones where feasible.

5. **Provide User-Controlled Simplification Options**: Allow users to specify simplification options or limits on recursion depth as part of the function call. This gives users more control over the evaluation process and can help avoid recursion errors in complex expressions.

### Example Conceptual Patch

Since a direct patch cannot be applied, below is a conceptual example of how recursion depth tracking might be implemented in a recursive function. This is for illustration purposes and not a direct fix for the issue:

```python
def evaluate_expression(expr, depth=0, max_depth=100):
    if depth > max_depth:
        raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth exceeded in expression evaluation")
    # Hypothetical expression evaluation logic
    if expr.is_complex():
        return evaluate_expression(simplify(expr), depth=depth+1, max_depth=max_depth)
    # Base case or other logic
    return simplified_expr
```

This approach provides a safeguard against exceeding the Python stack's recursion limit by explicitly tracking and limiting the recursion depth. 

Adapting this strategy to the specific case of SymPy's handling of expressions involving `cosh` and `acos` would require a detailed review of the relevant parts of the codebase and possibly a redesign of certain evaluation or simplification algorithms to better manage recursion depth.
