        "content": "Based on the search results, we can draw several conclusions and plan our next steps for addressing the issue regarding `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API without being wrapped by `requests` exceptions.\n\n1. **Exception Classes in `requests`**:\n   - We found two relevant exception classes in `requests/exceptions.py`: `RequestException` and `HTTPError`. `HTTPError` is a subclass of `RequestException`, which in turn is a subclass of `IOError`. This hierarchy suggests that `requests` has a structured way to handle exceptions, with `RequestException` likely serving as the base class for most, if not all, exceptions thrown by `requests`.\n\n2. **No Direct Handling Method**:\n   - The search did not find a method named `handle_exception`, indicating that exception handling might not be centralized in a single method or might be named differently. This suggests that the wrapping of exceptions could be happening in multiple places or in a more ad-hoc manner.\n\n3. **References to `urllib3.exceptions`**:\n   - The code snippets containing references to `urllib3.exceptions` are found in `requests/exceptions.py`, `requests/adapters.py`, and `requests/models.py`. This indicates that `requests` does interact with `urllib3` exceptions in some capacity. The presence of references in `adapters.py` is particularly noteworthy since adapters are likely responsible for making the actual HTTP requests and thus would be a logical place to handle or wrap exceptions from `urllib3`.\n\n4. **Specific Exceptions Not Found**:\n   - The search did not find direct references to `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` in the codebase. This absence could be the reason these exceptions are \"passing through\" without being wrapped by `requests` exceptions, as mentioned in the issue.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps should involve a closer examination of how `requests` interacts with `urllib3` exceptions, particularly in `requests/adapters.py` and `requests/exceptions.py`. We need to understand the current mechanism for wrapping or handling exceptions and identify why `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3` are not being caught and wrapped appropriately.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n- Examine the code in `requests/adapters.py` and `requests/exceptions.py` to see how `urllib3` exceptions are currently being handled.\n- Look for any existing mechanism that wraps or translates `urllib3` exceptions into `requests` exceptions and identify gaps that might explain the issue with `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.\n\nThis analysis will help us identify the exact location and mechanism to patch in order to ensure that all relevant `urllib3` exceptions are properly wrapped by `requests` exceptions, thus addressing the issue reported."

Given the multiple matches for `urllib3.exceptions` found here, it's a prime candidate for further investigation.\n        - `requests/exceptions.py`: Since this file contains definitions for `requests`' own exception classes, it may also contain logic or mappings that are supposed to wrap `urllib3` exceptions into these `requests`-specific exceptions.

        "content": "Based on the additional search results, we can refine our understanding of how `requests` interacts with `urllib3` exceptions and identify potential locations for the bug:\n\n1. **In `requests/adapters.py`**:\n   - The search results indicate that there are 8 snippets of code referencing `urllib3.exceptions` outside of any function definitions. This suggests that `urllib3` exceptions are being considered at a global level in this file, potentially for mapping or direct handling purposes. However, the fact that these references are not within a specific function might indicate that the exceptions are being imported or acknowledged but not necessarily wrapped or handled in a method-specific manner. This could be a key area where the handling of `urllib3` exceptions, specifically `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`, needs to be improved or implemented.\n\n2. **In `requests/exceptions.py`**:\n   - The single snippet found importing `HTTPError` from `urllib3.exceptions` as `BaseHTTPError` suggests that there is at least some level of direct interaction or wrapping of `urllib3` exceptions by `requests`. However, this does not directly address the issue with `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` not being wrapped, as these specific exceptions were not mentioned in the search results. It does, however, confirm that `requests` has a mechanism in place for dealing with some `urllib3` exceptions, which could potentially be extended or modified to include `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The absence of function-specific handling in `requests/adapters.py` for `urllib3` exceptions suggests that the current mechanism for dealing with these exceptions might be too broad or not sufficiently targeted to wrap all relevant `urllib3` exceptions into `requests` exceptions. This could explain why `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are \"passing through\" without being wrapped.\n- The import of `BaseHTTPError` in `requests/exceptions.py` indicates that there is an existing pathway for wrapping `urllib3` exceptions, but it may not cover all the necessary exceptions.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The bug likely resides in how `requests/adapters.py` handles (or fails to handle) `urllib3` exceptions at a global level, without specific methods dedicated to wrapping these exceptions into `requests`-specific exceptions.\n- There may also be an opportunity in `requests/exceptions.py` to extend or modify the existing exception handling mechanism to include `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3`.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications in `requests/adapters.py` to explicitly catch and wrap `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` into appropriate `requests` exceptions would be necessary. Additionally, reviewing and potentially extending the mechanism in `requests/exceptions.py` for wrapping `urllib3` exceptions could ensure a more comprehensive handling of these errors."
