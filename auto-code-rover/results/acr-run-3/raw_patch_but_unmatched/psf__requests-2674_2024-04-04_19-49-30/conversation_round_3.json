Search for the class in `requests` that might be responsible for handling exceptions.

        "content": "Based on the search results, we can draw several conclusions and plan our next steps for addressing the issue regarding `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API without being wrapped by `requests` exceptions.\n\n1. **Exception Classes in `requests`**:\n   - We found two relevant exception classes in `requests/exceptions.py`: `RequestException` and `HTTPError`. `HTTPError` is a subclass of `RequestException`, which in turn is a subclass of `IOError`. This hierarchy suggests that `requests` has a structured way to handle exceptions, with `RequestException` likely serving as the base class for most, if not all, exceptions thrown by `requests`.\n\n2. **No Direct Handling Method**:\n   - The search did not find a method named `handle_exception`, indicating that exception handling might not be centralized in a single method or might be named differently. This suggests that the wrapping of exceptions could be happening in multiple places or in a more ad-hoc manner.\n\n3. **References to `urllib3.exceptions`**:\n   - The code snippets containing references to `urllib3.exceptions` are found in `requests/exceptions.py`, `requests/adapters.py`, and `requests/models.py`. This indicates that `requests` does interact with `urllib3` exceptions in some capacity. The presence of references in `adapters.py` is particularly noteworthy since adapters are likely responsible for making the actual HTTP requests and thus would be a logical place to handle or wrap exceptions from `urllib3`.\n\n4. **Specific Exceptions Not Found**:\n   - The search did not find direct references to `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` in the codebase. This absence could be the reason these exceptions are \"passing through\" without being wrapped by `requests` exceptions, as mentioned in the issue.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps should involve a closer examination of how `requests` interacts with `urllib3` exceptions, particularly in `requests/adapters.py` and `requests/exceptions.py`. We need to understand the current mechanism for wrapping or handling exceptions and identify why `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3` are not being caught and wrapped appropriately.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n- Examine the code in `requests/adapters.py` and `requests/exceptions.py` to see how `urllib3` exceptions are currently being handled.\n- Look for any existing mechanism that wraps or translates `urllib3` exceptions into `requests` exceptions and identify gaps that might explain the issue with `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.\n\nThis analysis will help us identify the exact location and mechanism to patch in order to ensure that all relevant `urllib3` exceptions are properly wrapped by `requests` exceptions, thus addressing the issue reported."

Given the multiple matches for `urllib3.exceptions` found here, it's a prime candidate for further investigation.\n        - `requests/exceptions.py`: Since this file contains definitions for `requests`' own exception classes, it may also contain logic or mappings that are supposed to wrap `urllib3` exceptions into these `requests`-specific exceptions. The presence of `urllib3.exceptions` references suggests there might be an attempt to map or catch these exceptions here.\n\n    Without more detailed context from the suggested searches, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact methods or lines of code that need to be patched.

This suggests that `urllib3` exceptions are being considered at a global level in this file, potentially for mapping or direct handling purposes. However, the fact that these references are not within a specific function might indicate that the exceptions are being imported or acknowledged but not necessarily wrapped or handled in a method-specific manner. This could be a key area where the handling of `urllib3` exceptions, specifically `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`, needs to be improved or implemented.\n\n2. **In `requests/exceptions.py`**:\n   - The single snippet found importing `HTTPError` from `urllib3.exceptions` as `BaseHTTPError` suggests that there is at least some level of direct interaction or wrapping of `urllib3` exceptions by `requests`. However, this does not directly address the issue with `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` not being wrapped, as these specific exceptions were not mentioned in the search results. It does, however, confirm that `requests` has a mechanism in place for dealing with some `urllib3` exceptions, which could potentially be extended or modified to include `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The absence of function-specific handling in `requests/adapters.py` for `urllib3` exceptions suggests that the current mechanism for dealing with these exceptions might be too broad or not sufficiently targeted to wrap all relevant `urllib3` exceptions into `requests` exceptions. This could explain why `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are \"passing through\" without being wrapped.\n- The import of `BaseHTTPError` in `requests/exceptions.py` indicates that there is an existing pathway for wrapping `urllib3` exceptions, but it may not cover all the necessary exceptions.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The bug likely resides in how `requests/adapters.py` handles (or fails to handle) `urllib3` exceptions at a global level, without specific methods dedicated to wrapping these exceptions into `requests`-specific exceptions.\n- There may also be an opportunity in `requests/exceptions.py` to extend or modify the existing exception handling mechanism to include `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3`.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications in `requests/adapters.py` to explicitly catch and wrap `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` into appropriate `requests` exceptions would be necessary. Additionally, reviewing and potentially extending the mechanism in `requests/exceptions.py` for wrapping `urllib3` exceptions could ensure a more comprehensive handling of these errors."
