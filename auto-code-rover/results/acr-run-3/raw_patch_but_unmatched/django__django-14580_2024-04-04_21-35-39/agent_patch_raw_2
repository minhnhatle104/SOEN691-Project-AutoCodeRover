        models_import_needed = False
        for operation_string in operations:
            if 'models.' in operation_string:
                models_import_needed = True
                break
        if models_import_needed:
            if "from django.db import models" in imports:
                imports.discard("from django.db import models")
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations, models")
        else:
            imports.add("from django.db import migrations")</patched>
```

Explanation:
This modification adjusts the logic for determining when to include the `models` import in migration files. The original approach only checked for the direct presence of `from django.db import models` in the imports set, which could miss cases where models are indirectly referenced through fields or bases in operations. The patched version introduces a flag, `models_import_needed`, which is set to True if any operation string contains a reference to `models.`. This ensures that the `from django.db import migrations, models` import is added whenever there's a reference to `models`, directly addressing the issue reported.
