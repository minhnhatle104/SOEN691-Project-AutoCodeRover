            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: Yes\n\n    To gain a deeper understanding of how the `MigrationWriter` class operates, especially in terms of handling imports, fields, and model bases in migration files, we need to explore the class's methods and properties more broadly. Since the specific method names we searched for were not found, we should look into the class's overall functionality and any methods related to the serialization and writing process. Here are the search API calls to get more context:\n\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"as_string\", \"MigrationWriter\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"serialize\", \"MigrationWriter\")\n    ```\n\n    These searches aim to uncover how the `MigrationWriter` class converts migration data into a string format for the file and how it handles serialization, which might include the logic for determining necessary imports.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: \n\n    At this stage, we do not have enough detailed information to pinpoint the exact location of the bug within the files or methods. However, based on the information gathered so far, it is likely that the bug resides within the `MigrationWriter` class in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`. The bug could be related to how this class handles the serialization of models and their fields or determines which import statements to include in the generated migration files."
