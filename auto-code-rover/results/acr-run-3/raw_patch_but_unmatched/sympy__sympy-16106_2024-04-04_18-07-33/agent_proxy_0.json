Specifically, we need to look into the implementation of the `mathml` function, the `MathMLPrinter` class, and how it handles the `Indexed` object. Here are the API calls that would help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `Indexed` class to understand its structure and why it's not iterable.\n2. Search for the `MathMLPrinter` class to see how it's implemented and how it processes different types of objects.\n3. Search for the `mathml` method to understand its role in converting expressions to MathML format.\n4. Search for the `_print_Basic` method in the `MathMLPrinter` class, as the error trace suggests that the issue occurs when trying to iterate over an `Indexed` object in this method.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_class(\"Indexed\")`\n- `search_class(\"MathMLPrinter\")`\n- `search_method(\"mathml\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Basic\", \"MathMLPrinter\")`"
