Given the constraints and the nature of the request, without direct access to the actual implementation of `formatting.dataset_repr` and considering the provided context does not match the actual program structure, it's not feasible to provide a precise patch. 

However, I can offer a conceptual approach that developers familiar with the `xarray` codebase could adapt:

# Conceptual Patch

The goal is to enhance the dataset's string representation to include units for coordinates and data variables. This involves modifying the function responsible for generating this representation, presumably `formatting.dataset_repr`, to extract and display units from the attributes of each variable and coordinate.

**Note:** This is a conceptual approach. The actual implementation may vary based on the internal structure of the `xarray` library and the specific way units are stored within `Dataset` objects.

```python
# This is a conceptual patch and may not directly apply to the actual codebase.

<file>xarray/formatting.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code structure in formatting.dataset_repr
def dataset_repr(dataset):
    # Existing implementation that constructs the string representation
    # of the dataset without including units.
</original>
<patched>
def dataset_repr(dataset):
    # Begin with the existing implementation for constructing the base
    # string representation of the dataset.
    
    # Enhanced implementation to include units:
    coords_with_units = []
    for name, coord in dataset.coords.items():
        unit_str = coord.attrs.get('units', '')
        unit_repr = f", in {unit_str}" if unit_str else ""
        coords_with_units.append(f"* {name}{unit_repr} ({coord.dtype}) ...")
    
    data_vars_with_units = []
    for name, var in dataset.data_vars.items():
        unit_str = var.attrs.get('units', '')
        unit_repr = f", in {unit_str}" if unit_str else ""
        data_vars_with_units.append(f"{name}{unit_repr} ({var.dtype}) ...")
    
    # Construct the final representation by combining parts, including
    # the newly added units for coordinates and data variables.
    final_repr = "\n".join(["<xarray.Dataset>", ... , "\n".join(coords_with_units), "\n".join(data_vars_with_units)])
    return final_repr
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch outlines an approach to modify the dataset representation to include units. It assumes that units are stored in the `.attrs` dictionary of each `xarray.Variable` with a key of `'units'`. The patch demonstrates appending the unit information to the names of coordinates and data variables in the dataset's string representation.

Developers looking to implement this feature should adjust the patch according to the actual code structure and conventions of the `xarray` library, and thoroughly test the changes to ensure compatibility and correctness.
