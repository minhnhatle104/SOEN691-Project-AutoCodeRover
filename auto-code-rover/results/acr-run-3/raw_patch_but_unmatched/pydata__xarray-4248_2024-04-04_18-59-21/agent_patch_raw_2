Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without access to the specific implementation details of `formatting.dataset_repr` within the `xarray` library. The provided context does not include the actual content of the `formatting.dataset_repr` function, which is crucial for crafting a precise and applicable patch.

However, based on common practices and the structure of Python libraries that deal with data representation, a hypothetical approach to enhancing the `Dataset` representation to include units would involve modifying the function responsible for generating the string representation of datasets. This function would iterate over the dataset's variables, extracting units from their attributes and incorporating this information into the final string.

Without the actual code for `formatting.dataset_repr`, I can only suggest a conceptual approach that would likely involve:

1. Extracting units from the attributes of each variable in the dataset.
2. Modifying the string representation of each variable to include its units.
3. Ensuring that datasets without units or with partially defined units are handled gracefully.

This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding the library's internal structure and the specific mechanisms it uses to store and represent units. In real-world scenarios, contributing such a feature would also involve engaging with the library's maintainers, possibly through its issue tracker or contribution guidelines, to ensure that the enhancement aligns with the project's design principles and future roadmap.

For users or developers facing similar enhancement requests or bugs in open-source projects, the recommended steps include:

- Reviewing the project's documentation and source code to understand the relevant APIs and data structures.
- Engaging with the project's community through forums, issue trackers, or mailing lists to gather more context and guidance.
- Following the project's contribution guidelines to submit patches, pull requests, or feature requests.

In the absence of specific code snippets and direct access to the `formatting.dataset_repr` function, this conceptual guidance aims to provide a starting point for thinking about how to implement the requested feature.
