Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem might not be directly in the `parse_latex` or `convert_relation` functions themselves but rather in how nested fractions are handled during the conversion process. Since the provided code snippets do not show the detailed handling of fractions (i.e., the parsing and conversion of `\frac{}` LaTeX commands), the exact patch cannot be pinpointed without seeing the relevant code sections.

However, I can suggest a conceptual patch based on common issues with parsing nested structures. The problem described indicates that when converting nested fractions, the denominator of the outer fraction is not being correctly grouped, leading to an incorrect mathematical representation. A typical solution involves ensuring that the denominator in such expressions is treated as a single entity, which might involve adjusting the precedence or explicitly grouping the denominator.

Since the specific code handling the fraction conversion is not shown, I'll provide a conceptual patch that might be applied if the fraction handling code were visible:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet where fractions are converted without proper grouping
if latex_command == "\\frac":
    numerator = convert_latex_to_sympy(latex_parts[0])
    denominator = convert_latex_to_sympy(latex_parts[1])
    return numerator + "/" + denominator
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patched code snippet with proper grouping for the denominator
if latex_command == "\\frac":
    numerator = convert_latex_to_sympy(latex_parts[0])
    denominator = convert_latex_to_sympy(latex_parts[1])
    # Ensure the denominator is treated as a single entity
    return numerator + "/(" + denominator + ")"
</patched>
```

This modification is purely illustrative and assumes a simplistic handling of the `\frac{}` command. The actual implementation likely involves parsing tree manipulation and would require adjustments in the functions that process the parsed LaTeX tokens into SymPy expressions. The key takeaway is that wherever fractions are being converted, special care must be taken to ensure that the entire denominator is grouped together, especially in cases of nested fractions, to preserve the correct mathematical relationships.
