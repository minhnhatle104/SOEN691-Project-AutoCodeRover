Given the limitations of the provided context and the absence of specific code handling the fraction conversion directly in the snippets, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. The issue likely stems from how the parsed LaTeX expressions, particularly nested fractions, are converted into SymPy expressions. Without direct access to the code responsible for this conversion, especially the handling of `\frac{}`, any suggested patch would be speculative.

However, based on common practices in handling such parsing issues, a general approach to fixing the problem would involve ensuring that the conversion process correctly interprets and groups the numerator and denominator of fractions, particularly in nested scenarios. This might involve adjusting the parsing rules or the logic in the `convert_relation` or a similar function that processes the parsed output into SymPy expressions.

Since a specific patch cannot be provided without the relevant code, I recommend the following steps for someone looking to fix the issue:

1. **Review the ANTLR Grammar**: Check the ANTLR grammar used for LaTeX parsing, focusing on the rules for fractions (`\frac{}`). Ensure that the grammar correctly differentiates between the numerator and denominator in nested fractions.

2. **Examine the Conversion Logic**: In the `convert_relation` function or similar, review how the parsed fractions are converted into SymPy expressions. There might be a need to adjust how nested fractions are handled to ensure that the entire denominator is treated as a single entity, possibly by introducing explicit grouping.

3. **Implement Grouping for Denominators**: In the logic that converts parsed fractions to SymPy expressions, ensure that denominators, especially in nested fractions, are correctly grouped. This might involve modifying the tree traversal or the conversion logic to introduce parentheses or a similar grouping mechanism around the denominator.

4. **Test with Nested Fractions**: After implementing changes, thoroughly test the parsing of nested fractions to ensure that the issue is resolved. This should include cases similar to the one reported as well as other complex nested structures.

Without the ability to directly modify the program based on the provided snippets, these steps offer a guideline for addressing the issue within the project's context.
