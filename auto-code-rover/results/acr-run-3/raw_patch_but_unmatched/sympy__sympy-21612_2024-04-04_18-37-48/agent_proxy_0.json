            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the LaTeX parsing, specifically for fractions, is implemented in the project. The issue points to a problem with parsing nested fractions in LaTeX, leading to incorrect mathematical expressions due to missing brackets in the denominator. Given the information, we should focus on the parsing mechanism for LaTeX expressions, particularly how fractions are handled.\n\nThe `parse_latex` function is directly mentioned in the issue, so we should start by searching for this function to understand its implementation and how it deals with fractions.\n\nAdditionally, since fractions in LaTeX are represented by the `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}` syntax, it would be beneficial to search for any code snippets that deal with this specific pattern or related parsing logic. This could help us identify where the parsing logic fails to correctly interpret nested fractions.\n\nTherefore, the following search API calls are necessary:\n\n1. `search_method(\"parse_latex\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the `parse_latex` function to understand how LaTeX expressions are parsed and where the issue with fraction parsing might originate.\n\n2. `search_code(\"\\\\frac{\")`: Searching for the `\\frac{` pattern will help us identify any specific handling of fractions in the codebase, which could be relevant to solving the issue.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing and fixing the problem with LaTeX fraction parsing."
