Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without access to the specific parts of the code that handle the parsing and conversion of LaTeX fraction expressions. The issue likely lies in the nuanced handling of nested fractions during the parsing process, which is not directly visible in the provided snippets.

Without the ability to pinpoint the exact location in the code where fractions are parsed and converted, and in the absence of specific code handling the `\frac{}` LaTeX command, providing a concrete patch is not feasible. The resolution to the issue would require a detailed examination of the parsing logic, particularly how nested fractions are handled, to ensure that the entire denominator of a fraction is correctly interpreted as a single entity, preserving the intended mathematical structure.

To move forward, developers would need to:

1. **Examine the ANTLR grammar and parsing logic** in `sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py` to understand how fractions are parsed, especially focusing on the handling of nested fractions.
2. **Identify and modify the conversion logic** that transforms the parsed LaTeX fractions into SymPy expressions, ensuring that denominators in nested fractions are correctly grouped to reflect the intended mathematical relationships.
3. **Implement and test changes** to confirm that nested fractions are parsed and converted correctly, using the reported issue as a test case among others.

This approach requires access to and familiarity with the project's parsing infrastructure, including the ANTLR grammar definitions and the conversion logic used to translate parsed LaTeX into SymPy expressions.
