Given the limitations and the nature of the interaction, it's clear that a direct patch to the Python code or the HTML template cannot be provided in the expected format due to the lack of direct access to the `read_only_password_hash.html` template content. The issue described pertains to HTML content and structure, which falls outside the Python code modifications that have been the focus of our attempts.

However, the resolution to the issue described involves adjusting the HTML template used by the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` to ensure compliance with HTML standards regarding label elements. Specifically, the 'for' attribute in a label should only be used when it points to a corresponding input element's ID. Since the widget is read-only and does not include an input element, the label should not use the 'for' attribute.

Given the constraints, here is a conceptual explanation of the patch, acknowledging that it cannot be directly applied without access to the template:

### Conceptual Patch Explanation

**File to be modified**: `read_only_password_hash.html` (The exact location within the Django project would typically be within a templates directory, but the precise path depends on the project's structure.)

**Original Issue**: A label element within the template incorrectly includes a 'for' attribute that points to a non-existent or non-labelable element, as the widget renders read-only text, not an input field.

**Resolution Approach**:
- Locate the label element within the `read_only_password_hash.html` template.
- Remove the 'for' attribute from the label element or ensure it correctly points to an existing, labelable element if the design has been updated to include such an element.

**Note**: Without direct access to the template, this explanation is based on the issue's description and standard HTML and Django practices. The actual implementation may vary based on the template's current content and the project's specific requirements.

This conceptual explanation aims to guide the necessary manual adjustments in the HTML template to resolve the issue, acknowledging the limitations of this interaction format for applying direct code patches.
