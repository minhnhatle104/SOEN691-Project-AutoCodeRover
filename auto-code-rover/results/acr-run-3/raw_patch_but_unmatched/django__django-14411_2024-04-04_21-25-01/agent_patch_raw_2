Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it's clear that the direct modification needed to resolve the issue lies within the HTML template `read_only_password_hash.html`, which we do not have direct access to in this scenario. The Python code provided for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` correctly sets up the context for the template but does not inherently contain the issue related to the 'for' attribute in a label element.

Since the issue is specifically about the HTML rendering and not the Python code that prepares the context, and without direct access to or content of the `read_only_password_hash.html` template, we cannot provide a precise patch that would directly modify the program's codebase to resolve the issue as initially requested.

The appropriate action to resolve the issue would involve manually editing the `read_only_password_hash.html` template to ensure that any label elements do not include a 'for' attribute that points to a non-existent or non-labelable element, in line with HTML standards and accessibility guidelines. This action is based on the understanding of the issue and standard practices for HTML and Django template editing.

In summary, without the ability to access the specific template content (`read_only_password_hash.html`) and based on the information provided, a direct patch cannot be formulated in the context of this interaction. The resolution involves manual intervention in the template file, which falls outside the scope of the Python code modifications that can be generated here.
