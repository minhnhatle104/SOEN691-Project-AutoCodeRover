Given the issue is related to the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`'s use of a label that points to a non-labelable element, and considering that the widget's rendering is based on a template (`read_only_password_hash.html`), the patch should ensure that the template adheres to HTML standards by not using a 'for' attribute that points to a non-existent or non-labelable element. Since we don't have direct access to the template's content through the provided information, the patch will focus on the Python code that prepares the context for the template, ensuring any guidance or adjustments needed are noted for when the template is accessed or modified.

However, without direct access to the `read_only_password_hash.html` template's content, we can only speculate on the exact change needed in the template. The Python code provided does not directly indicate misuse of the 'for' attribute but prepares the context that is likely used by the template. The actual change should be made in the template file to either remove the 'for' attribute from the label or adjust the template logic to ensure it complies with HTML standards.

Since we cannot modify the template directly here, I'll provide a hypothetical patch that would be applied to the template file, assuming access to it. This is based on the understanding that the issue lies within the HTML structure and not the Python code itself.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/templates/auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html</file>
<original>
<label for="id_password">Password:</label>
<div>{{ value }}</div>
</original>
<patched>
<!-- Assuming the issue is with a label 'for' attribute pointing to a non-existent input, we remove the 'for' attribute -->
<label>Password:</label>
<div>{{ value }}</div>
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the original template incorrectly uses a `for` attribute in a label that points to a non-existent input field, given that the widget is read-only and does not render an input element. The patched version removes the `for` attribute, ensuring the label is correctly associated with the context it displays without implying a relationship with an input element.

Please note, the actual template content was not provided, and this patch is speculative, based on the description of the issue and the common practices in HTML. The real template might require a different or additional modification.
