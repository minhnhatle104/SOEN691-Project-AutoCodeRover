Given the context and the nature of the issue, without direct access to the specific codebase or the exact lines causing the issue, I will provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices and the nature of the error described. This patch assumes that the issue lies in the way styles are registered or accessed within the `matplotlib` library, specifically in the `lib/matplotlib/style/core.py` file, and that "seaborn-colorblind" is not being properly recognized due to changes in how styles are loaded or registered in version 3.6.1.

Please note, this is a speculative solution intended to illustrate how one might approach writing a patch based on the described issue. The actual solution may vary depending on the specific implementation details and codebase structure of `matplotlib`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/style/core.py</file>
<original>
# This is a speculative original code block, assuming the issue is with how styles are registered
def _load_styles():
    # Code to load styles
    # Missing or incorrect registration of 'seaborn-colorblind'
</original>
<patched>
def _load_styles():
    # Code to load styles
    # Assuming 'seaborn-colorblind' was not properly registered or loaded
    # Added or corrected registration of 'seaborn-colorblind'
    if 'seaborn-colorblind' not in _style_library:
        _style_library['seaborn-colorblind'] = _load_style_from_file('seaborn-colorblind.mplstyle')
</patched>
```

This patch is based on the assumption that the style library is loaded or registered through a function (hypothetically named `_load_styles` here), and that the specific style 'seaborn-colorblind' was either not included due to an oversight or due to changes in the way styles are handled between versions. The patched code explicitly checks for the presence of 'seaborn-colorblind' in the style library and attempts to load it from a corresponding style file if it's missing.

Remember, the actual implementation details and the solution may vary. It's crucial to review the specific codebase, understand the changes between the versions mentioned, and test any changes thoroughly.
