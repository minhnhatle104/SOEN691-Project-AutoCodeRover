Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the actual source code and specific details about the implementation of the `matplotlib` style library in version 3.6.1, it's challenging to provide an exact patch. However, I can offer guidance on how one might approach creating a patch based on common practices and the nature of the error described.

Since we've identified that the issue likely resides within `lib/matplotlib/style/core.py` and involves the handling or registration of the "seaborn-colorblind" style, a developer tasked with fixing this issue would typically:

1. **Review the style registration process**: Understand how styles are registered and loaded into the library in the affected version of the library. This involves looking at the initialization of the style library and any changes from previous versions.

2. **Identify the missing link for "seaborn-colorblind"**: Determine why "seaborn-colorblind" is not being recognized. This could be due to a missing entry in a list or dictionary of styles, a failure to load the style from a file, or a change in the naming convention.

3. **Implement and test the fix**: Once the cause is identified, the fix might involve adding the missing style to the appropriate data structure or ensuring the style file is correctly loaded. Testing the fix would involve verifying that "seaborn-colorblind" can be successfully loaded and applied to plots.

Without the ability to run actual search API calls or view the specific implementation details, I cannot provide a direct code patch. However, the general approach to debugging and fixing such an issue involves careful review of the changes between versions, understanding the mechanism for loading and registering styles, and testing the fix across the environments where the issue was reported.

For anyone working directly on the `matplotlib` codebase or a similar issue, I recommend:

- **Consulting the project's documentation and developer guides**: These can offer insights into the intended architecture and mechanisms for extending or modifying functionality.
- **Engaging with the community**: If the project is open source, forums, mailing lists, and issue trackers can be invaluable resources for understanding known issues and discussing potential fixes.
- **Reviewing version control history**: Looking at commits and pull requests between the working and non-working versions could highlight relevant changes.

I hope this guidance is helpful for approaching the resolution of the issue, even though I cannot provide a specific code patch.
