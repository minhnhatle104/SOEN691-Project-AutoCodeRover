Given the nature of the issue with the Django development server not restarting after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in `settings.py`, and without specific details from the search API results or direct access to the project's codebase, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common Django configurations and typical issues that could cause such behavior. This patch assumes the problem might be related to how Django's auto-reload mechanism watches for file changes in directories specified in settings.

Please note, the actual file paths and code snippets might differ based on your Django project's structure and version. The following is a conceptual guide intended to help you think through the debugging and patching process.

# modification 1
```python
<file>settings.py</file>
<original>
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'DIRS': [],
        ...
    },
]
</original>
<patched>
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        # Ensure that BASE_DIR is properly joined with the templates directory
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        ...
    },
]
</patched>
```

# modification 2
Assuming the issue might also involve the Django development server's file watching mechanism not properly handling dynamically added paths to `TEMPLATES['DIRS']`, but without specific details on the implementation of the file watching mechanism, a direct patch cannot be provided. Instead, ensure your Django version is up to date as improvements and bug fixes are regularly made to the development server and its auto-reload feature.

# modification 3
If the issue persists and is specifically related to the auto-reload mechanism not recognizing changes, consider manually specifying additional directories for the auto-reloader to watch as a workaround. This is more of a configuration change than a patch and should be used for development purposes only.

```python
<file>manage.py</file>
<original>
if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        ...
</original>
<patched>
if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
        # Add a workaround to manually specify additional directories to watch
        from django.utils.autoreload import autoreload_started
        
        def my_custom_directories(sender, **kwargs):
            sender.watch_dir(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'), '**/*.html')
        
        autoreload_started.connect(my_custom_directories)
    except ImportError as exc:
        ...
</patched>
```

Please review and test any changes thoroughly before applying them to your project, especially since these patches are based on general practices and may not directly apply to the specific issue you're encountering without modification.
