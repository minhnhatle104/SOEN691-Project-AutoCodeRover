I understand the constraints and the need for a specific solution, but without the ability to directly interact with the project's codebase or perform live actions such as making API calls, I'm unable to provide a patch that directly corresponds to the original program's code. My guidance is based on general practices and theoretical knowledge, aimed at helping you conceptualize a solution.

Given the issue with the Django development server not restarting after modifying `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in `settings.py`, a common approach would involve ensuring that the development server is correctly monitoring file changes, including those in the settings file and template directories. However, without specific details about the failure or the ability to inspect the project's code, any provided code would be speculative and might not accurately address the problem.

For issues related to Django's auto-reload mechanism not triggering on file changes, the problem often lies in how the file system events are being monitored or how the paths are configured in the Django settings. A typical resolution approach would involve:

1. Verifying the correct setup of `BASE_DIR` and its usage in `TEMPLATES['DIRS']`.
2. Ensuring that the development environment is correctly configured to detect file system changes.
3. Reviewing Django's documentation on the development server and auto-reload feature for any known issues or configuration tips.
4. Testing with different configurations or simplifying the settings to identify if a specific setting or combination thereof is causing the issue.

Since a direct patch cannot be provided, I recommend reviewing the Django project's configuration, particularly how `BASE_DIR` is defined and used, and consulting the Django documentation or community forums for insights into similar issues encountered by others. Additionally, ensuring that your Django version is up to date and checking the Django issue tracker for any reported bugs related to the development server and settings reloading might provide further guidance.
