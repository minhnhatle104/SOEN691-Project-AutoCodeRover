Since the problem seems to be related to how Django 3.2 alpha handles primary keys in inherited models, we should first look into the base model (e.g., `Entity`) from which models like `User` are inheriting to see how the primary key is defined there. Additionally, examining the configuration of the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the project settings or app configurations mentioned in the warnings could provide insights into why Django is raising these warnings.\n\nLet's start by searching for the base class `Entity` to see how the primary key is defined there. Then, we will look into one of the specific models mentioned in the issue (e.g., `User`) to understand how it inherits from the base class. Lastly, we'll search for the configuration of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the project settings or app configurations to see if it's properly set.\n\n1. `search_class(\"Entity\")`: This will help us understand how the primary key is defined in the base class.\n2. `search_class(\"User\")`: By examining the `User` class, we can see how it inherits from `Entity` and whether it properly inherits the primary key.\n3. `search_code(\"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD\")`: This will help us find where `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is configured in the project settings or app configurations."

        "content": "Based on the search results, let's summarize and analyze the context collected to address the issue regarding `models.W042` warnings in Django 3.2 alpha related to auto-created primary keys in inherited models.\n\n### Entity Class\nWe found two `Entity` classes in the codebase, both located in test directories (`tests/select_for_update/models.py` and `tests/order_with_respect_to/models.py`). However, the provided snippets do not include details on how the primary key is defined within these `Entity` classes. Given that these are located in test directories, it's possible that neither of these is the relevant `Entity` class mentioned in the issue, or the primary key definition is standard and not customized in a way that would prevent `models.W042` warnings.\n\n### User Class\nThere are 11 `User` classes found across various files in the codebase. The issue description specifically mentions a `User` model that inherits from an `Entity` class, but without more specific information about the file path or application, it's challenging to determine which `User` class is relevant to the issue. The `User` classes are spread across different test directories and the Django auth module, indicating that the issue might be related to a custom `User` model not directly found in the search results.\n\n### DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD Configuration\nThe search for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` yielded 27 snippets across various files, including `django/conf/global_settings.py`, `django/db/models/options.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/apps/config.py`, and several test files. This indicates that `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is a configurable setting that influences how Django auto-generates primary keys for models. The presence of this setting in `global_settings.py` and its usage in model-related files suggest that configuring `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` correctly in the project's settings or specific app configurations could address the `models.W042` warnings.\n\n### Analysis\nThe issue seems to stem from a change in how Django 3.2 alpha handles auto-generated primary keys for models, particularly when those models inherit from a base model that already defines a primary key. The warnings suggest configuring `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` either globally in the project settings or locally within specific app configurations to explicitly specify the type of auto-generated primary key to use (e.g., `BigAutoField`).\n\nGiven the information collected, the next steps to resolve the issue would involve:\n1. Identifying the correct `Entity` class that serves as a base model for others, specifically looking into how its primary key is defined.\n2. Reviewing the inheritance structure of the models mentioned in the warnings to ensure they correctly inherit the primary key from their base model.\n3. Configuring `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the project's settings or the specific app configurations mentioned in the warnings to explicitly define the desired auto-generated primary key type.\n\nWithout specific code snippets or file paths for the models mentioned in the issue, it's challenging to provide a direct patch. However, the analysis points towards a solution involving the correct configuration of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` and ensuring proper inheritance of primary keys in custom models."
