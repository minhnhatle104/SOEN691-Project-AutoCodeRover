Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without specific details about the models and the settings file from the actual project. However, since the issue revolves around the handling of primary keys in inherited models and the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting in Django 3.2 alpha, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the warnings based on Django's documentation and best practices.

Since we don't have access to the actual codebase and cannot provide a direct patch to specific files, the following is a hypothetical approach that developers facing similar issues might consider:

### Conceptual Patch for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` Setting

Developers should ensure that their Django project's settings explicitly define the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to avoid the `models.W042` warning. This is particularly important when upgrading to Django 3.2 or newer, where the handling of auto-created primary keys has been updated.

#### Hypothetical Patch:

```python
# In your Django project's settings.py file

# Before the patch, the setting might not be present, leading to Django's default behavior.
# (No original code snippet to remove, as the setting might simply be absent.)

# After the patch, add the following line to explicitly set the default auto field type:
DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
```

This change specifies that Django should use `BigAutoField` as the default type for auto-created primary keys across all models in the project unless overridden. This is recommended for new projects to ensure that primary keys have enough space for a large number of objects.

### Conceptual Guidance for Model Inheritance

For models inheriting from a base model where the primary key is explicitly defined, developers should review their model definitions to ensure that Django's inheritance mechanisms are correctly used. This might involve setting `abstract = True` in the base model's `Meta` class if the base model should not be used to create a separate database table but instead only serve as a base for other models.

#### Hypothetical Guidance:

```python
# In the base model (e.g., Entity) definition
class Entity(models.Model):
    # Assuming there's an explicit primary key or other fields here
    class Meta:
        abstract = True  # Ensures Entity is used as a base class only

# In the inherited model (e.g., User) definition
class User(Entity):
    # User-specific fields here
    # Inherits all fields from Entity, including the primary key, if explicitly defined
```

This guidance is conceptual and aims to address common scenarios where model inheritance might lead to unexpected behavior regarding primary keys. Developers should adjust their models based on the specific requirements and structure of their project.

Please note, without access to the specific codebase and detailed information about the models that triggered the `models.W042` warnings, these suggestions are intended to provide a general direction for resolving the issue within the constraints of the information provided.
