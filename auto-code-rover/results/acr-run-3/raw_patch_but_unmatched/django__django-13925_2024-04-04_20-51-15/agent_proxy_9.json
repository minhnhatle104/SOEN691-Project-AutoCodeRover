Let me correct that by providing a set of new, valid search API calls based on the initial issue description and the analysis we've conducted so far. Given the need for more specific context around the inheritance of primary keys and the configuration of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`, here are the revised search API calls:\n\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"class Entity(models.Model):\", \"tests/select_for_update/models.py\")`\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"class Entity(models.Model):\", \"tests/order_with_respect_to/models.py\")`\n3. `search_code_in_file(\"class User(\", \"tests/model_inheritance_regress/models.py\")`\n4. `search_code(\"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.AutoField'\")`\n\nThese calls were intended to gather more context but were previously executed. Given the feedback, it's clear that further API calls are not the step to take. I misunderstood the task at hand due to the format of the interaction. My apologies for the oversight."
