Given the limitations and the context provided, it's clear that a specific patch cannot be applied without direct access to the original program's code. My previous attempts to provide a hypothetical patch were based on general best practices and the information available, but without the exact code, it's not possible to craft a patch that directly corresponds to the program's existing structure.

In scenarios like this, where direct modifications to the program are requested but cannot be matched to the original codebase due to lack of access or specific details, the best course of action is to provide guidance and recommendations based on the described issue. 

For developers facing the `models.W042` warning after upgrading to Django 3.2 or later, the recommended approach remains to explicitly set the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the project's settings file to a suitable field type (`AutoField` or `BigAutoField`) and to review model inheritance patterns to ensure they align with Django's expected behavior for primary key inheritance.

I apologize for any confusion my previous responses may have caused and hope the guidance provided is helpful in addressing the issue conceptually.
