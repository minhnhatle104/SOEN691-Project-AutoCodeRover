Given the nature of the issue and the analysis provided, a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without specific details about the models and settings file. However, based on the general understanding of the issue, I can suggest a hypothetical patch that addresses the configuration of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the project's settings to mitigate the `models.W042` warnings. This patch assumes that the project's settings file is located at `your_project/settings.py` and that explicitly setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` would resolve the warnings by ensuring a consistent primary key field type across the project.

# modification 1
```python
<file>your_project/settings.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming the original settings file does not explicitly set DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD
</original>
<patched>
# Default primary key field type.
DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
</patched>
```

This patch adds the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting to the project's settings file, specifying `BigAutoField` as the default auto-created primary key field type. This change aims to address the `models.W042` warnings by making the primary key field type explicit across all models in the project, thereby aligning with Django 3.2's expectations for primary key field specification.

Please note, the actual resolution might require additional steps, including reviewing model inheritance patterns and ensuring that primary keys are correctly inherited from base models without triggering Django's auto primary key creation mechanism. If specific models are incorrectly inheriting or not defining primary keys as intended, those models would need to be individually reviewed and potentially modified to explicitly declare their primary key fields or correctly inherit them from their base models.
