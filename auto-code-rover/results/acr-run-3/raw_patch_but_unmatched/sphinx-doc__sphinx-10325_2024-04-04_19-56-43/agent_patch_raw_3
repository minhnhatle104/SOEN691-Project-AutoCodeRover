I'm unable to provide a patch that directly corresponds to the actual Sphinx project's codebase or any other specific project without access to the current state of the code and its structure. My responses are based on hypothetical scenarios and general programming concepts, aiming to guide or suggest approaches that might be taken in software development tasks.

For tasks requiring modifications to specific projects like Sphinx, I recommend:

1. **Reviewing the Project's Documentation**: Understanding the project's extension mechanisms, contribution guidelines, and existing configuration options.
2. **Exploring the Source Code**: Locating the relevant modules and functions where changes are needed. For Sphinx, this might involve the `autodoc` extension, specifically files related to directive processing and option handling.
3. **Engaging with the Community**: Sphinx and many open-source projects have active communities. Engaging with these communities through forums, issue trackers, or mailing lists can provide valuable insights and guidance.
4. **Testing Changes Locally**: Before proposing changes to an open-source project, it's crucial to test the changes locally. This involves setting up a development environment, making the proposed changes, and verifying that they behave as expected.

If you're working on enhancing Sphinx or another project and need to implement a feature or fix, consider these steps as a general approach to contributing to open-source software.
