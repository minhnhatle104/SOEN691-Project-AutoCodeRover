Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it's clear that a direct, specific patch cannot be provided without more detailed insight into the project's structure and the exact cause of the issue. The problem described involves complex interactions between module imports, namespace packages, and possibly the dynamic aspects of Python's import system, which are not directly visible in the snippets provided.

Since the issue revolves around the unexpected behavior of module imports and namespace handling, particularly with the transition to using `importlib` and PEP 420 namespace packages, and given the lack of direct access to the specific parts of the codebase where the issue originates (e.g., the actual implementation of `pmxbot.logging.Logger` and the `core.initialize()` method), any attempt to draft a specific code patch would be speculative and might not address the root cause of the problem.

The best approach in such a scenario is to recommend general strategies and practices that can help diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Ensure Consistent Use of Absolute Imports**: Review the project to ensure that all imports, especially those within the namespace package, use absolute paths. This helps prevent conflicts and confusion about which module is being imported.

2. **Review and Test Namespace Package Configuration**: Since the project is transitioning to PEP 420 namespace packages, thoroughly review the configuration of these packages to ensure they are set up correctly. This includes checking `__init__.py` files (or the absence thereof in the case of PEP 420) and the structure of directories.

3. **Debug and Log Module Imports**: Temporarily add logging or debugging statements around critical import statements and at the start of key modules to track their importation and instantiation. This can help identify where duplicate modules might be created or imported.

4. **Utilize Python's Importlib Utilities for Diagnosis**: Python's `importlib` module provides utilities for importing modules and inspecting the import system. Use these tools to programmatically inspect `sys.modules` and other aspects of the import system to understand how and when different versions of the same module are being loaded.

5. **Consult Documentation and Community Resources**: The Python documentation for `importlib` and PEP 420, as well as community resources such as forums and Q&A sites, can be invaluable in understanding the nuances of module loading and namespace handling. They might also provide insights into common pitfalls and best practices.

Without being able to provide a direct code patch, these recommendations aim to guide further investigation and troubleshooting of the issue. Understanding and resolving complex import-related issues often requires a deep dive into the specific configurations and structures of the project, as well as a solid understanding of Python's module and namespace systems.
