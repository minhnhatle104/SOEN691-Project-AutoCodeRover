Given the context and the nature of the issue described, it appears that the problem might not be directly in the test code itself but rather in how the project's structure and import mechanisms interact, especially with the transition to using `importlib` and PEP 420 namespace packages. The issue of having two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present, one in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`, suggests a problem with how modules are imported and recognized within the test environment.

Without specific details on the implementation of `pmxbot.logging.Logger` and the `core.initialize()` method, and given that the provided test code does not directly manipulate `sys.modules` or show explicit misconfigurations, the best approach is to propose a general strategy to ensure consistent module importation and avoid duplication in `sys.modules`.

A common cause for such issues is the inconsistency in the module's import path, which might be exacerbated by the transition to `importlib` and PEP 420 namespace packages. Ensuring that all imports use the full and correct path and that there are no conflicting or duplicate paths in the environment (e.g., through PYTHONPATH or relative imports) can help.

Since the direct code modification to fix the issue cannot be pinpointed without more context, below is a conceptual patch that aims to ensure consistent import paths and module references throughout the project. This approach involves modifying how tests and the application initialize and reference modules, ensuring they align with `importlib` and PEP 420 expectations.

# Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>project_initialization_or_test_setup_file.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming there's an initialization or setup part where the project's modules are imported or configured in a way that might cause inconsistencies.
import some_module
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure consistent import paths using importlib and absolute imports. This might involve setting up import hooks or configuring the import system at the project's entry points or test setup.
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.find_spec("some_module")
some_module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(some_module)

# Additionally, ensure that any dynamic imports or module manipulations are consistent with PEP 420 namespace packages.
</patched>
```

# Additional Consideration

```python
<file>any_test_or_module_file.py</file>
<original>
# If there are relative imports or ambiguous module references that might conflict with the intended module resolution.
from . import some_module
</original>
<patched>
# Use absolute imports and the full path to ensure that the correct module is imported, avoiding duplicates in sys.modules.
from project_namespace.sub_namespace import some_module
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch aims to address potential root causes of the issue by ensuring consistent and correct module importation practices. Actual implementation details would require a deeper understanding of the project's structure and the specific ways `importlib` and namespace packages are used.
