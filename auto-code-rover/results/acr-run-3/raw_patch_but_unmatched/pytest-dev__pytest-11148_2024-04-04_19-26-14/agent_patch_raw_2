Given the nature of the issue and the information provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be accurately formulated without more specific details about the implementation of `pmxbot.logging.Logger`, the `core.initialize()` method, and the exact mechanism leading to the duplication of modules in `sys.modules`. The issue seems deeply rooted in the project's transition to using `importlib` for module loading and the intricacies of handling namespace packages according to PEP 420.

Without explicit buggy lines of code or a clear understanding of the misconfiguration causing the issue, any attempt to provide a concrete patch would be speculative. The problem described does not appear to be a simple bug that can be fixed with a few lines of code but rather a complex issue related to the project's overall structure, configuration, and possibly the way Python's module system is being used.

The tests provided in the context do not exhibit direct manipulation of `sys.modules` or show a clear misuse of `importlib` that could lead to the described issue. They are standard uses of `pytest` and `importlib` for testing purposes, suggesting that the problem might not lie within these test configurations themselves but possibly in how the project's modules are organized, imported, or initialized elsewhere in the codebase.

Given these constraints, the best course of action would be to:

1. **Review Project Structure and Import Statements**: Ensure that all modules are imported consistently using absolute paths and that there are no conflicting modules within the project or with external dependencies. This includes checking for inconsistent usage of relative imports that might lead to different modules being loaded under the same name in `sys.modules`.

2. **Audit Dynamic Imports**: If the project uses dynamic imports, review these implementations to ensure they are compatible with PEP 420 namespace packages and do not inadvertently lead to module duplication.

3. **Enhance Logging and Debugging**: Temporarily enhance logging around module imports and the initialization process to trace the creation and registration of modules in `sys.modules`. This could help identify where the duplication occurs.

4. **Consult Python Documentation and Community**: Given the complexity of the issue, consulting Python's documentation on `importlib`, PEP 420, and possibly seeking advice from the Python community or forums might provide additional insights or similar cases.

Without the ability to apply a direct patch, these steps represent a strategic approach to diagnosing and potentially resolving the underlying issue.
