Given the constraints and the nature of the request, it's clear that providing a precise patch directly applicable to your specific Django project is challenging without access to the actual codebase. However, I can guide you through a general approach to manually adjust your Django models and migrations to address the issue described. This guidance assumes familiarity with Django's model and migration system and should be adapted to fit the specific details of your project.

### General Approach to Manually Adjust Models and Migrations

#### Step 1: Update the `Authors` Model
First, you need to update the `Authors` model to use a `ManyToManyField` instead of a `ForeignKey`. This change also involves removing the `unique_together` constraint, as it's not applicable to `ManyToManyField`.

```python
# Assuming the file path to your models is app/models.py
# Original Authors model with ForeignKey
class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_set = models.ForeignKey(
        ProjectDataSet,
        on_delete=models.PROTECT
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)

# Updated Authors model with ManyToManyField
class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_sets = models.ManyToManyField(
        ProjectDataSet,
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
    # Removed the unique_together constraint
```

#### Step 2: Manually Create a Migration
Since the automatic migration process (`makemigrations`) might not correctly handle complex changes or the removal of constraints, you can create a manual migration to carefully manage the transition.

1. **Remove the `unique_together` constraint**: Create an initial migration to remove the `unique_together` constraint if it exists in your current model.

2. **Change the field type**: Then, create another migration to remove the `ForeignKey` and add the `ManyToManyField`.

Here's how you might structure a manual migration file:

```python
# Assuming the migration file path is app/migrations/0002_update_authors_model.py
from django.db import migrations, models

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('app', '0001_initial'),  # Adjust this to match your actual dependency
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RemoveField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_set',
        ),
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_sets',
            field=models.ManyToManyField(to='app.ProjectDataSet'),
        ),
        # Assuming the unique_together constraint needs to be removed in a separate operation
        migrations.AlterModelOptions(
            name='authors',
            options={},
        ),
    ]
```

### Important Notes:
- **Backup Your Database**: Always backup your database before applying migrations, especially manual ones that significantly alter the schema.
- **Test in Development**: Apply and test these migrations in a development environment to ensure they work as expected before deploying them to production.
- **Adjust Names and Dependencies**: The class names, field names, and dependencies (`'app', '0001_initial'`) are placeholders. You'll need to adjust them to match your actual application's structure and state.

This general approach should guide you through resolving the issue with your Django project's migrations. Remember, the specifics might vary based on your project's details and the current state of your database schema.
