Given the nature of the issue described, which involves changing a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField` in the `Authors` model and dealing with the removal of a `unique_together` constraint that is no longer applicable, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on standard Django model and migration practices. Since I don't have access to the actual file paths or the original code snippets from your project, I'll use placeholders where specific details would be necessary. Please adapt the paths and code snippets to fit your project's structure.

### Modification 1: Update the `Authors` model to use `ManyToManyField`

```python
<file>app/models.py</file>
<original>
class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_set = models.ForeignKey(
        ProjectDataSet,
        on_delete=models.PROTECT
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)
</original>
<patched>
class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_sets = models.ManyToManyField(
        ProjectDataSet,
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Create a manual migration to remove the `unique_together` constraint and alter the field

Assuming you have already generated a migration file (e.g., `0002_auto_20230101_1234.py`) that attempts to make these changes but encountered errors, you would manually edit this file as follows:

```python
<file>app/migrations/0002_auto_20230101_1234.py</file>
<original>
# This would be the automatically generated operations that caused the error,
# which we don't have the exact details of. You would replace this section
# with the corrected operations below.
</original>
<patched>
from django.db import migrations, models
import django.db.models.deletion

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('app', '0001_initial'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RemoveField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_set',
        ),
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_sets',
            field=models.ManyToManyField(to='app.ProjectDataSet'),
        ),
        migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
            name='authors',
            unique_together=set(),
        ),
    ]
</patched>
```

### Note:
- The `RemoveField` and `AddField` operations in the patched migration handle the removal of the `ForeignKey` and the addition of the `ManyToManyField`, respectively.
- The `AlterUniqueTogether` operation with an empty set effectively removes the previously defined `unique_together` constraint.
- Ensure that the `dependencies` array correctly references the last migration before this one (`'0001_initial'` is used here as a placeholder).

Please adjust the file paths, class names, and field names according to your project's specific details. After making these changes, test the migration thoroughly in a development environment before applying it to production.
