When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on \u200bdjango-users and was asked to report this here.\n</issue>"

This could be due to several reasons, such as limitations in the search API's scope, the specificity of the search queries, or the structure of the Django codebase itself.\n\nGiven this situation, we need to adjust our approach to gather relevant context and information that could help us address the issue. Since direct searches did not yield results, we might need to explore related areas of the Django framework that could indirectly provide insights into the problem. Here are a few steps we can take:\n\n1. **Explore the Migration System**: Since the issue arises during a migration, understanding Django's migration system, especially how it handles model changes and permissions, could be crucial. However, without direct access to the migration file or method, we might need to look into the general mechanism Django uses for migrations and permission updates.\n\n2. **Proxy Model Handling**: The issue specifically mentions problems with models recreated as proxy models. It might be beneficial to understand how Django treats proxy models differently in terms of database schema and permissions.\n\n3. **Unique Constraints in Django**: The error message points to a violation of a unique constraint. Understanding how Django enforces unique constraints, especially in the context of the `auth_permission` table, could provide clues.\n\n4. **Community and Documentation**: Since the direct search did not yield results, referring to Django's official documentation, community forums, or even the source code on platforms like GitHub could provide insights. This is outside the scope of the current interaction model but is a common step in real-world debugging.\n\nGiven the limitations, let's try to adjust our search strategy to focus on broader concepts that might still be relevant to solving the issue:\n\n- Investigate how Django handles migrations and permissions for proxy models in general. This could involve looking into the migration framework and the permissions system without specifying the exact migration file or method name.\n- Explore how unique constraints are managed and checked during migrations, which might not directly mention `auth_permission` but could still be relevant.\n\nUnfortunately, without the ability to directly search for broader concepts or access external documentation and community resources through this interface, our ability to proceed further is limited. In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve manual review of Django's migration system documentation, source code analysis, and potentially reaching out to the Django community for insights on similar issues."

The searches for \"proxy model migration,\" \"permissions migration,\" and \"unique constraint permission\" did not return any results, indicating that either the search terms used were too specific or the underlying issue might not be directly referenced in a way that's easily searchable with broad terms.\n\n### Analysis of the Situation\n\n1. **Complexity of Django's Migration System**: Django's migration system is complex and handles a wide range of scenarios, including model changes, proxy models, and permission updates. The absence of direct search results suggests that the issue might be deeply embedded in the migration logic or the way Django handles proxy models and permissions.\n\n2. **Proxy Models and Permissions**: The original issue mentions a problem with migrations involving proxy models and a unique constraint violation in the `auth_permission` table. This points towards a specific interaction in Django's handling of permissions for proxy models during migrations, which might not be straightforward to locate without a deep dive into the source code.\n\n3. **Unique Constraint Violations**: The error message indicates a violation of a unique constraint for permissions. This suggests that the migration process attempts to create permissions that already exist, possibly due to assumptions about proxy models that do not hold in this specific case.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout direct access to relevant code snippets or more specific search capabilities, we are limited in our ability to diagnose and propose a specific fix for the issue. However, the analysis suggests a few potential areas for further investigation:\n\n- **Migration Logic for Proxy Models**: The issue likely involves the logic that Django uses to handle migrations involving proxy models, especially how it determines which permissions need to be created or updated.\n  \n- **Permission Handling During Migrations**: There might be a gap in how Django's migration system checks for existing permissions before attempting to create new ones, leading to unique constraint violations.\n\n- **Manual Review and Community Engagement**: At this point, a manual review of Django's migration system and permission handling code, particularly as it relates to proxy models, would be necessary. Additionally, engaging with the Django community through forums or the Django project's issue tracker could provide insights or reveal if others have encountered and resolved similar issues.\n\nGiven the limitations encountered through the search API, moving forward would likely involve a combination of reviewing Django's documentation, source code analysis, and community engagement to identify and address the root cause of the migration issue."
