Given the constraints of this interaction, where I cannot directly access or modify code, I will provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices for addressing issues related to Django migrations and unique constraint violations. This patch is speculative and intended as an illustrative example of how one might approach resolving the described issue within Django's migration system, particularly concerning proxy models and permissions.

Please note, the actual file paths, original code, and patched code cannot be accurately provided without access to the specific Django project's codebase and the migration causing the issue. However, I'll outline a general approach that could be adapted to the specific circumstances.

### Hypothetical Patch for Migration Issue

#### Modification 1: Ensuring Unique Permissions Before Creation

This modification assumes there's a part of the migration script that attempts to create permissions without checking if they already exist, leading to a unique constraint violation.

```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py</file>
<original>
permissions = [
    ('add_modelname', 'Can add modelname'),
    ('change_modelname', 'Can change modelname'),
    ('delete_modelname', 'Can delete modelname'),
    ('view_modelname', 'Can view modelname'),
]
for codename, name in permissions:
    Permission.objects.create(codename=codename, name=name)
</original>
<patched>
permissions = [
    ('add_modelname', 'Can add modelname'),
    ('change_modelname', 'Can change modelname'),
    ('delete_modelname', 'Can delete modelname'),
    ('view_modelname', 'Can view modelname'),
]
for codename, name in permissions:
    Permission.objects.get_or_create(codename=codename, name=name)
</patched>
```

#### Modification 2: Handling Permissions for Proxy Models

This modification speculates that the migration does not properly handle proxy models, attempting to reapply permissions that should already exist.

```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py</file>
<original>
for model in apps.get_models():
    for perm in model._meta.permissions:
        Permission.objects.create(
            codename=perm[0],
            name=perm[1],
            content_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(model),
        )
</original>
<patched>
for model in apps.get_models():
    for perm in model._meta.permissions:
        Permission.objects.get_or_create(
            codename=perm[0],
            name=perm[1],
            content_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(model, for_concrete_model=False),
        )
</patched>
```

### Note

These modifications are based on common patterns for addressing unique constraint violations in Django migrations and the handling of permissions for proxy models. The actual resolution might require adjustments based on the specific details of the migration and the models involved. Always test migration changes in a development environment before applying them to production to ensure they do not have unintended effects.
