Given the limitations of the provided context and the absence of direct access to the specific parsing logic within `_read_table_qdp` or related utility functions where the case sensitivity issue arises, providing a precise patch is challenging. The provided code snippet for `_read_table_qdp` does not include the logic where QDP commands are parsed and interpreted, which is crucial for addressing the issue at hand.

Without direct visibility into how commands are processed within the QDP file parsing implementation, any proposed patch would be speculative. A typical approach to resolving case sensitivity issues involves normalizing the case of both the input commands and the expected commands before comparison, but without specific lines of code where this comparison occurs, it's not possible to craft a precise patch.

To effectively address the issue described, one would need to inspect the implementation details of functions like `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and any other internal logic that interprets QDP commands. This would likely involve tracing through the code to find where command strings from the QDP file are compared against expected command identifiers and applying case normalization (e.g., using `.lower()` or `.upper()`) at those points.

Given the constraints, I recommend reviewing the parsing logic within the QDP handling code to identify where command strings are processed. Once these locations are identified, applying case normalization before command processing would be the appropriate fix. Unfortunately, without specific code snippets showing where the issue occurs, it's not feasible to provide a more detailed or accurate patch.
