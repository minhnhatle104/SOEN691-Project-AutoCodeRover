Based on the provided context and the identified location of the bug, it seems that the actual case sensitivity issue likely occurs in the parsing logic within or called by `_read_table_qdp`, which is not directly shown in the provided code snippet. Since the specific parsing logic where commands are interpreted (and where the case sensitivity issue arises) is not directly visible in the snippet for `_read_table_qdp`, we'll have to hypothesize a solution based on common practices for handling such issues.

Given that QDP commands are not inherently case-sensitive, the solution involves ensuring that command parsing within the QDP file reading process is case-insensitive. This can typically be achieved by converting commands to a consistent case (either all uppercase or all lowercase) before comparison or processing.

Although the direct parsing logic is not shown, a common place to implement such a fix would be in the function or method that interprets the QDP commands. Assuming there's a part in the parsing process where commands like "READ SERR" are identified, we can apply a `.lower()` or `.upper()` method to both the input commands and the expected commands before comparison.

Here's a hypothetical patch based on common patterns for addressing case sensitivity in command parsing:

# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet where commands are parsed
if command == "READ SERR":
    # process the command
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patched code snippet to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner
if command.lower() == "read serr":
    # process the command
</patched>
```

Please note, the above modification is speculative and assumes there's a straightforward comparison of command strings somewhere in the parsing logic. The actual implementation may require adjustments based on the specific way commands are parsed and processed in the `_read_table_qdp` function or related utility functions. If the parsing involves more complex structures or multiple points where commands are interpreted, similar case normalization (using `.lower()` or `.upper()`) would need to be applied consistently across all such instances.
