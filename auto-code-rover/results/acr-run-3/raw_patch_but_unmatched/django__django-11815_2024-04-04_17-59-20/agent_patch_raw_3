Given the constraints and the format of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch to the Django codebase without access to the specific implementation details of `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`. My previous responses aimed to conceptualize a solution based on common practices and the issue description. However, without the ability to view or match the exact code from the Django project, crafting a precise patch is not feasible in this format.

To address the issue within the constraints of our interaction, the best course of action would be to manually review the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file in the Django codebase, specifically focusing on how enum values are serialized for migrations. The goal would be to modify the serialization logic to ensure that the enum's name is used instead of its value, thus avoiding issues with localization and value changes over time.

For developers facing similar issues, the recommended steps are:

1. Open the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file in your Django project.
2. Locate the function or method responsible for serializing field default values, particularly for enums.
3. Modify the serialization logic to check if the object being serialized is an instance of an enum and, if so, serialize it using its name rather than its value. This might involve using the enum's `__class__.__name__` and `name` attributes to construct the serialized representation.

This guidance is based on general principles and understanding of Python and Django's handling of enums and migrations. Actual implementation may vary based on the Django version and project specifics. Always test changes thoroughly in a development environment before applying to production.
