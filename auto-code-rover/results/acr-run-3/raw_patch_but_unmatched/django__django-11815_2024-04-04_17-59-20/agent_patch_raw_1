Given the nature of the issue described and the context provided by the search results, a hypothetical patch to address the problem of Django migrations incorrectly using the value of an enum object instead of its name can be proposed. This patch would involve modifying the serialization logic in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` to ensure that enum names are used as default values in migrations instead of their localized string representations.

Please note, the actual implementation details in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` are not provided, so the following patch is conceptual and based on a typical approach to handling such serialization issues in Django. The actual code might differ, and this patch should be adapted accordingly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/serializer.py</file>
<original>
if isinstance(value, Enum):
    return repr(value.value), {}
</original>
<patched>
if isinstance(value, Enum):
    return "%s.%s" % (value.__class__.__name__, value.name), {}
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the original serialization logic directly uses the `value` attribute of the `Enum` object, which would result in the actual value (potentially localized) being used in the migration. The patched version changes this behavior to use the enum class name and the name of the enum member, ensuring that the enum is referenced by its name rather than its value. This approach would maintain consistency across different localizations and avoid the described issue.

Remember, this patch is hypothetical and serves as an example of how one might address the described issue based on the provided context. The actual implementation in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` might require a different approach or additional considerations. Always test patches thoroughly in a development environment before applying them to a production codebase.
