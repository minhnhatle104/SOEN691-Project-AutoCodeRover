Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, without direct access to the specific implementation details of `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, I provided a conceptual solution based on common practices and the issue description. However, since the exact code snippet from `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` cannot be matched to an actual segment in Django's codebase due to the limitations of this format, a precise patch cannot be formulated without seeing the actual implementation.

In a real-world scenario, to address the issue described, one would typically:

1. Identify the method within `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` responsible for serializing field default values, especially those involving enums.
2. Modify the serialization logic to ensure that the enum's name is used instead of its value. This might involve checking if the default value is an instance of an enum and, if so, serializing it in a way that references the enum name and member name.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch that matches the original program's code, I recommend the following steps for someone with access to the Django codebase:

- Locate the serialization logic for default field values in migrations within `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`.
- Adjust this logic to check for enum types and ensure their names, rather than their values, are used in the serialized output.

This approach would resolve the issue of migrations breaking due to localized enum values changing over time or under different localization settings.
