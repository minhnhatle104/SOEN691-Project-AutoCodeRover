I apologize for the confusion earlier. Given the limitations of this interaction model, I cannot directly apply changes to the actual codebase or verify the exact match of the provided code snippets against the real code files. My previous responses were based on a hypothetical approach to addressing the described issue, assuming direct access to modify the project's source code.

In a real-world scenario, the modifications I suggested would involve wrapping database operations within transaction blocks to mitigate the risk of encountering a "database is locked" error, especially when working with SQLite databases in a testing environment that involves multiple databases.

However, since I cannot directly verify or apply these changes to your project, I recommend taking the conceptual approach described in my previous messages and manually applying it to the relevant sections of your codebase. Specifically, you would:

1. Import the `transaction` module from `django.db`.
2. Use `transaction.atomic(using=db)` to wrap operations that interact with the database within the `setUpTestData` methods of your test classes.

This approach aims to ensure that each operation that writes to the database is executed within its own transaction, potentially reducing the likelihood of encountering database lock issues.

If you're facing difficulties applying these changes or if the issue persists, I recommend consulting the Django documentation on transactions and testing, or seeking assistance from the Django community, such as forums or mailing lists, where you can share specific code snippets and error messages for more targeted advice.
