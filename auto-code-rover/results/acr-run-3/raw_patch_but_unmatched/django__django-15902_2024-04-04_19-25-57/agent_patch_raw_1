Given the context and the nature of the issue described, it seems that the deprecation warning related to "default.html" is not directly tied to the `ManagementForm` class in `django/forms/formsets.py`. Since the issue mentions a deprecation warning due to template usage which is considered insignificant for `ManagementForm` (as it primarily deals with hidden inputs), and there's no direct reference to "default.html" or a `render` method within the `ManagementForm` class, the patch would need to address the broader mechanism of how deprecation warnings are triggered for template usage in form or formset rendering.

However, without specific details on where the deprecation warning is implemented or triggered in relation to the `ManagementForm` and without direct evidence of a bug within the provided `ManagementForm` class code, creating a precise patch is challenging. The issue seems to be more about preventing a deprecation warning from being raised unnecessarily rather than modifying the `ManagementForm` class itself.

Since the direct cause of the deprecation warning (e.g., the use of "default.html") was not identified in the provided code or search results, and assuming the issue might be with how Django's form rendering system handles or warns about template usage, a hypothetical patch might involve adding a mechanism to suppress deprecation warnings specifically for management form rendering scenarios where the template is not significant.

However, without concrete evidence or specific code snippets that trigger the deprecation warning, providing a meaningful patch is not feasible. In real-world scenarios, the next steps would involve:

1. Identifying the exact mechanism or code path that triggers the deprecation warning for template usage.
2. Understanding the conditions under which the warning is considered appropriate.
3. Implementing a check or condition to suppress the warning when rendering `ManagementForm` instances, if it's determined that the warning is not relevant in this context.

Given these constraints, I'm unable to provide a specific patch. Further investigation into the Django project's form rendering and deprecation warning mechanisms would be necessary to create an effective solution.
