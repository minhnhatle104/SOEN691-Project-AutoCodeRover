Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, without a direct link to the triggering of the deprecation warning within the provided code snippets or a clear understanding of the mechanism behind the deprecation warning, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. However, I'll offer a conceptual approach to address the concern raised in the issue description regarding the deprecation warning and the `ManagementForm`.

Since the issue revolves around a deprecation warning that is considered unnecessary for the `ManagementForm` due to its nature of only producing hidden inputs, and there's no direct indication of how "default.html" is involved in this process within the provided code, the following is a hypothetical solution aimed at illustrating a potential approach to suppress such a warning specifically for the `ManagementForm` rendering scenario.

### Hypothetical Solution:

```python
<file>django/forms/formsets.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for the original code context, as the specific trigger for the deprecation warning is not identified.
</original>
<patched>
# Assuming there's a mechanism to suppress warnings specifically for certain operations:
from django.utils.deprecation import suppress_deprecation_warnings

class ManagementForm(Form):
    """
    Keep track of how many form instances are displayed on the page. If adding
    new forms via JavaScript, you should increment the count field of this form
    as well.
    """

    TOTAL_FORMS = IntegerField(widget=HiddenInput)
    INITIAL_FORMS = IntegerField(widget=HiddenInput)
    MIN_NUM_FORMS = IntegerField(required=False, widget=HiddenInput)
    MAX_NUM_FORMS = IntegerField(required=False, widget=HiddenInput)

    @suppress_deprecation_warnings
    def as_p(self):
        # Custom rendering logic here, with deprecation warnings suppressed for this method.
        return super().as_p()

    def clean(self):
        cleaned_data = super().clean()
        cleaned_data.setdefault('TOTAL_FORM_COUNT', 0)
        cleaned_data.setdefault('INITIAL_FORM_COUNT', 0)
        return cleaned_data
</patched>
```

### Explanation:

- The hypothetical `@suppress_deprecation_warnings` decorator is a conceptual tool that would be used to suppress specific deprecation warnings for the decorated method. This approach assumes that the Django project has a mechanism to selectively suppress warnings based on context or source.
- The `as_p` method is used here as an example of where the form's rendering might be customized or where the deprecation warning might be undesirably triggered. The actual method or process that needs this suppression would depend on where the "default.html" deprecation warning is being triggered in relation to the `ManagementForm`.
- The correction in the `clean` method from `TOTAL_FORM_COUNT` and `INITIAL_FORM_COUNT` to be string literals is a minor fix to align with the typical usage of `cleaned_data` dictionary keys.

This solution is purely illustrative and speculative, aiming to provide a conceptual approach to the issue based on the information available. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the deprecation warning mechanism and how it interacts with form rendering in the Django project.
