I understand the limitations we're facing. Given the scenario and the inability to directly access or modify the Sphinx codebase within this environment, I'm unable to provide a concrete patch or code modifications that directly correspond to the actual source code of Sphinx.

To contribute effectively to resolving the issue described, involving `rst_prolog` and its interaction with domain directives and toctree inclusion, I recommend the following steps for developers with access to the Sphinx project:

1. **Deep Dive into the Sphinx Documentation and Source Code**: Specifically, focus on the implementation of `rst_prolog` handling, the parsing of reStructuredText (reST) documents, and the generation of the toctree. Understanding the flow and architecture of these components is crucial.

2. **Identify the Component Causing the Issue**: Based on the description, it seems that the interaction between `rst_prolog` and the parsing of domain directives in headings might be the root cause. The components likely involved include the configuration system (`config.py`), the reST parser (`parsers.py`), and possibly utilities for handling reST content (`util/rst.py`).

3. **Localize the Bug**: Use debugging tools or manual code inspection to trace how documents with `rst_prolog` set and domain directives in headings are processed differently. This step is critical to understanding where the logic fails or behaves unexpectedly.

4. **Develop a Solution**: Once the problematic area is identified, modify the code to ensure that `rst_prolog` is applied in a way that does not interfere with the parsing of headings or the inclusion of such headings in the toctree. This might involve adjusting the parsing logic or the order in which `rst_prolog` is applied to the document content.

5. **Test Thoroughly**: Implement tests to cover cases with and without `rst_prolog`, with various domain directives in headings, to ensure the solution addresses the issue without side effects. Testing in different configurations and Sphinx projects is also advisable to ensure broad compatibility.

6. **Document and Contribute the Fix**: Prepare a detailed pull request or patch submission, including a description of the problem, the analysis and debugging process, the proposed solution, and the testing performed. Follow the Sphinx project's contribution guidelines for code style, documentation, and tests.

While I can't provide a specific patch in this format, I hope these steps guide you or any developer looking to address this issue in the Sphinx project. Engaging with the Sphinx community through their issue tracker, mailing lists, or chat channels can also provide additional insights and support.
