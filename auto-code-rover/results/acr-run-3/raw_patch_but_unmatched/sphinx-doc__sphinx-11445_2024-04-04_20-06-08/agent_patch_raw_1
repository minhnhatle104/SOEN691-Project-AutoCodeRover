Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices and potential points of intervention related to the handling of `rst_prolog`, domain directives, and toctree inclusion in Sphinx. Please note, without direct access to the specific codebase and the exact lines causing the issue, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a possible approach to resolving the described problem.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/util/rst.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical example and may not directly correspond to the actual code structure
def apply_rst_prolog(text, prolog):
    """Prepend the rst_prolog to the text."""
    return prolog + '\n' + text
</original>
<patched>
# This patch ensures that the rst_prolog is applied in a way that does not interfere with the processing of top-level headings, especially those containing domain directives.
def apply_rst_prolog(text, prolog):
    """Prepend the rst_prolog to the text, ensuring it does not disrupt top-level headings."""
    # Check if the first non-whitespace character is a domain directive and handle accordingly
    if text.lstrip().startswith(':mod:`'):
        # Insert the prolog after the first newline to avoid disrupting the top-level heading
        first_newline = text.find('\n')
        if first_newline != -1:
            return text[:first_newline] + '\n' + prolog + text[first_newline:]
    return prolog + '\n' + text
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/parsers.py</file>
<original>
# Again, this is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes
class RSTParser:
    def parse(self, inputstring, document):
        # Apply rst_prolog before parsing
        inputstring = self.apply_rst_prolog(inputstring, self.config.rst_prolog)
</original>
<patched>
class RSTParser:
    def parse(self, inputstring, document):
        # Modify the approach to applying rst_prolog to ensure it does not affect the document structure
        # This change assumes the existence of an updated apply_rst_prolog method that handles edge cases more gracefully
        inputstring = apply_rst_prolog(inputstring, self.config.rst_prolog)
</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are based on a general understanding of how Sphinx processes reStructuredText documents and applies configurations like `rst_prolog`. The actual implementation details, including method names, class structures, and how configurations are applied, may vary significantly in the actual Sphinx codebase. Therefore, it's crucial to review the actual code, test these changes in a controlled environment, and adjust the patch as necessary based on the specific behaviors and architecture of the Sphinx version you are working with.
