            "content": "To address the issue with the pretty printing of vectors in SymPy, especially focusing on the incorrect display and baseline alignment, we need to gather more context about how pretty printing is implemented for vectors in SymPy. Given the information in the issue, we will focus on the `CoordSysCartesian` class and how its instances are pretty-printed, particularly looking into methods that might be responsible for rendering the output, such as those related to pretty printing or displaying vectors.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `CoordSysCartesian` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods it might contain for pretty printing. Additionally, since the issue involves pretty printing, it's also relevant to look into SymPy's pretty printing system, which might not be directly part of `CoordSysCartesian` but could be affecting its output. However, without specific names of pretty printing methods, we'll start with what's directly mentioned in the issue.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"CoordSysCartesian\")\n```"
