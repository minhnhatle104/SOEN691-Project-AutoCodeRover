Given the constraints of our interaction and the inability to directly access or modify the SymPy codebase, I provided a hypothetical approach to addressing the issue based on common practices and an understanding of how pretty printing might be implemented in such a system. However, without specific details on the original code structure and the exact nature of the bug, creating a precise patch that directly applies to the program is beyond the scope of this interaction.

To contribute effectively to an open-source project like SymPy, or to resolve issues within any software project, direct access to the code, a thorough understanding of the project's contribution guidelines, and an ability to test changes locally are essential. This ensures that any proposed fixes are relevant, accurate, and beneficial to the project.

For those looking to resolve similar issues in their projects or contribute to open-source projects, here are general steps to follow:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Obtain the latest version of the source code from the project's repository.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Ensure you can reproduce the bug using the examples or descriptions provided in the issue tracker.
3. **Identify the Bug Location**: Use debugging tools, logging, or a review of the relevant subsystem (in this case, pretty printing) to locate the source of the issue.
4. **Develop a Fix**: Make code changes that resolve the issue. This might involve modifying existing functions, adding new logic, or refactoring parts of the code.
5. **Test Your Changes**: Run existing tests and add new tests where necessary to ensure your changes address the issue without introducing new bugs.
6. **Follow Contribution Guidelines**: Prepare your changes for submission according to the project's contribution guidelines. This typically involves creating a pull request with a detailed description of the changes and the issue they address.
7. **Engage with the Community**: Be prepared to discuss your changes with project maintainers and community members. They may provide feedback or request modifications before your changes can be merged.

While I can offer guidance and hypothetical solutions, engaging directly with the project's codebase and community is the best way to address specific issues and contribute to open-source projects.
