Given the limitations and the feedback received, let's adjust our strategy to further investigate the issue with pretty printing in SymPy, especially concerning vectors and the `CoordSys3D` class. To gain more context and potentially identify the bug's location, we will perform a broader search that might encompass areas of the codebase related to pretty printing mechanisms and their application to vector objects.\n\n- do we need more context:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"pretty_print\")\nsearch_code(\"CoordSys3D\")\n```\n\nBy searching more broadly for references to pretty printing mechanisms and directly for `CoordSys3D`, we aim to uncover any connections or configurations that might not have been apparent in the initial, more targeted searches. This approach should help us gather additional context that could lead to identifying where the issue with pretty printing vectors might be located within the SymPy codebase."
