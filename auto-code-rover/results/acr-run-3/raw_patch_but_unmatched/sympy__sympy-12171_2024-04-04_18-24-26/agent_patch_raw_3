Given the constraints and the nature of the task, it appears there's been a misunderstanding in the instructions for providing a patch. Since the methods `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` are to be added to the `MCodePrinter` class and do not replace any existing code, the format for a patch with `<original>` and `<patched>` sections doesn't directly apply.

However, to clarify the intended modifications to the `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` file for adding these methods, here's a description of the changes to be made, without the `<original>` and `<patched>` format, as these methods are new additions to the class:

**Description of Changes to be Made to `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`:**

1. **Add `_print_Derivative` Method to `MCodePrinter` Class:**
   This method is responsible for correctly formatting derivative expressions for Mathematica. It uses the `stringify` method to join the arguments of the derivative expression with a comma.

   ```python
   def _print_Derivative(self, expr):
       return "D[%s]" % (self.stringify(expr.args, ", "))
   ```

2. **Add `_print_Float` Method to `MCodePrinter` Class:**
   This method handles floating-point numbers with exponents, converting the 'e' notation to Mathematica's '*^' notation for exponents.

   ```python
   def _print_Float(self, expr):
       res = str(expr)
       return res.replace('e', '*^')
   ```

These methods should be added within the body of the `MCodePrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` file. They do not replace any existing code but are new functionalities to enhance the Mathematica code printer's ability to handle derivatives and floating-point numbers with exponents correctly.
