**Explanation**:
- **Modification 1**: Adds a new method `_print_Derivative` to the `MCodePrinter` class. This method correctly formats derivative expressions for Mathematica code. It uses the `stringify` method to join the arguments of the derivative expression with a comma, which is consistent with Mathematica's syntax for derivatives.
- **Modification 2**: Adds a new method `_print_Float` to handle floating-point numbers with exponents. This method replaces the 'e' notation commonly used in Python with Mathematica's '*^' notation for exponents. This ensures that floating-point numbers are correctly interpreted by Mathematica.

These modifications address the issue by implementing the missing functionality for handling derivatives and floating-point numbers with exponents in the Mathematica code printer.
