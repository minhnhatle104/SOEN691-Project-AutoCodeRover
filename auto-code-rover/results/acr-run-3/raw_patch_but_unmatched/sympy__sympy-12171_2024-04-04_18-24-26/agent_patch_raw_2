Given the context that the original program does not contain the methods `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` in the `MCodePrinter` class, the task is to add these methods to handle derivatives and floats with exponents correctly. Since there is no original code snippet to replace (we are adding new functionality), the patch will focus on adding these new methods to the `MCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>
# Since the _print_Derivative method does not exist in the MCodePrinter class, there's no original code snippet to show here.
</original>
<patched>
class MCodePrinter(CodePrinter):
    # Existing methods and attributes of the MCodePrinter class...
    
    def _print_Derivative(self, expr):
        return "D[%s]" % (self.stringify(expr.args, ", "))
        
    # Continue with the rest of the class definition...
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>
# Since the _print_Float method does not exist in the MCodePrinter class, there's no original code snippet to show here.
</original>
<patched>
class MCodePrinter(CodePrinter):
    # Existing methods and attributes of the MCodePrinter class...
    
    def _print_Float(self, expr):
        res = str(expr)
        return res.replace('e', '*^')
        
    # Continue with the rest of the class definition...
</patched>
```

**Note**: The patches are conceptual since they add new methods to the `MCodePrinter` class. The placement of these new methods within the class should be done in a way that maintains the organization and readability of the class. It's also important to ensure that these methods integrate well with the existing methods and the overall functionality of the `MCodePrinter` class.
