Given the information from the issue, here are the API calls that would be most relevant:\n\n1. **Search for the `bell` function**: This will help us understand where the `bell` function is defined and how it's implemented, which is crucial for addressing the issue with its limit behavior.\n   \n   `search_method(\"bell\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `limit` method**: Since the issue is specifically with the behavior of the `limit` method when applied to the `bell` function, understanding how `limit` is implemented and how it interacts with various functions will be key.\n\n   `search_method(\"limit\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and formulating a solution."
