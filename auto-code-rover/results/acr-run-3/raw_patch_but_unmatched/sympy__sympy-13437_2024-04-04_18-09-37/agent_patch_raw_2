Given the constraints and the nature of the request, creating an accurate patch without direct access to the specific implementation details of the Sympy library is challenging. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to how one might address the issue based on standard practices in Python and common patterns in handling similar issues within libraries like Sympy. This conceptual approach should serve as a guideline for creating a patch.

### Conceptual Approach to Patching the `bell` Function Limit Issue

#### Modification 1: Enhance the `bell` function to handle infinity in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`

Since I cannot provide an exact match for the original program's code, a conceptual change would involve checking if the argument `n` is infinity and, if so, returning infinity directly. This logic would be placed at the beginning of the `bell` function implementation.

```python
# Conceptual Patch
if n is S.Infinity:
    return S.Infinity
```

#### Modification 2: Update limit handling for `bell` in `sympy/series/limits.py`

A conceptual approach to modifying the limit computation would involve adding a case to specifically check for the `bell` function when computing limits. If the function being evaluated is the `bell` function and the limit is approaching infinity, the method should return infinity.

```python
# Conceptual Patch
if isinstance(expr, Bell) and to is S.Infinity:
    return S.Infinity
```

### Conceptual Explanation

- **Modification 1**: Directly addresses the issue by modifying the `bell` function to correctly handle the case when `n` is infinity. This is a preventive measure ensuring that the function behaves correctly when directly invoked with an infinite argument.

- **Modification 2**: Ensures that the general limit computation logic in Sympy can correctly handle the `bell` function by checking for this specific case and returning infinity as expected. This modification assumes the existence of a general mechanism for evaluating limits and adds a special case for the `bell` function.

### Note

These conceptual patches are based on common patterns and practices in handling similar functionality and issues within mathematical and symbolic computation libraries. The actual implementation would require access to the current Sympy codebase, understanding of its architecture and conventions, and possibly discussions with the project maintainers for the best approach to address the issue. Additionally, unit tests should be created or updated to cover this new behavior, ensuring that the change does not introduce regressions and behaves as expected across different scenarios.
