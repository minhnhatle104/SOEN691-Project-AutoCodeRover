I understand the challenge here. Given the constraints and the nature of this interaction, I'll provide a conceptual approach to creating a patch, as I cannot access the actual source code or its specific structure. This conceptual approach is meant to guide you on how to implement the feature based on standard Python practices. 

Since I cannot match the original program's exact code snippets without direct access to the source code, the following is a generalized solution that should be adapted to fit the specific details of your project's codebase.

### Conceptual Patch for Adding `version_info`

#### Modification 1: Define `version_info` in `_version.py`
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet
__version__ = '3.3.4'
</original>
<patched>
__version__ = '3.3.4'
# Added version_info for easier version comparison
version_info = tuple(int(x) for x in __version__.split('.')[:3])
</patched>
```
This modification assumes the file `_version.py` contains the version string and adds a `version_info` tuple. The tuple is constructed by splitting the `__version__` string and converting each segment into an integer. This allows for straightforward numerical comparison of versions.

#### Modification 2: Import and expose `version_info` in `__init__.py`
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet
from ._version import __version__
</original>
<patched>
from ._version import __version__, version_info
</patched>
```
This change ensures that `version_info` is imported and made available at the package's top level, allowing users to easily access it for version comparisons.

### Notes:
- These modifications are based on common Python project structures and practices. You will need to adjust the file paths, original code snippets, and patched code to match your project's specific implementation details.
- It's essential to test these changes thoroughly to ensure they integrate seamlessly with the rest of the project and do not introduce any unintended side effects.

This approach provides a straightforward way to add a `version_info` tuple to your project, enhancing the usability of version checks and comparisons.
