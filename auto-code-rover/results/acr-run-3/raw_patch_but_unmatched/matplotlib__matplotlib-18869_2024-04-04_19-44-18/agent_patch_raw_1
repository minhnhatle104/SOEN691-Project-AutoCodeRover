Based on the issue description and the context retrieved, I'll propose a patch to add a `version_info` tuple to the project for easier version comparison. This approach is chosen for its simplicity and commonality in Python projects. Since `LooseVersion` is not currently used in the project and adding it might introduce unnecessary complexity, we'll focus on implementing `version_info`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
__version__ = '3.3.4'  # Example version
</original>
<patched>
__version__ = '3.3.4'  # Example version
version_info = tuple(int(x) for x in __version__.split('.'))
</patched>
```

This modification adds a `version_info` tuple to `_version.py`, which is derived from the `__version__` string. This tuple allows for easier comparison of version numbers.

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>
from ._version import __version__
</original>
<patched>
from ._version import __version__, version_info
</patched>
```

In this modification, `version_info` is imported in `__init__.py` along with `__version__`. This makes `version_info` accessible from the top level of the package, allowing users to easily perform version comparisons.

These modifications address the issue by providing a `version_info` tuple that can be compared with other tuples, enhancing the usability of version checks within the project. This approach follows a common pattern seen in other Python packages and integrates smoothly with the existing versioning system.
