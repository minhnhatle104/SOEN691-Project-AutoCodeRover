Given the constraints and the inability to directly match the original program's exact code structure, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common Python project structures and the information provided. Since I can't access the actual source code, the following patch is a conceptual solution intended to illustrate how one might add a `version_info` tuple to a project like the one described.

Please note, the actual implementation may require adjustments to fit the precise codebase structure and conventions of the project you're working on.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder, as the exact original code snippet is not provided.
# Typically, this file would contain something like:
# __version__ = '3.3.4'
</original>
<patched>
__version__ = '3.3.4'  # Assuming this is the current version format
# Adding a version_info tuple for easier version comparison
version_info = tuple(int(part) for part in __version__.split('.') if part.isdigit())
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the `_version.py` file contains a version string in the format `'major.minor.patch'` and adds a `version_info` tuple that splits this string into a tuple of integers. This allows for easier numerical comparison of version parts.

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# Again, this is a placeholder. The original code snippet might import the version string like so:
# from ._version import __version__
</original>
<patched>
# Importing both __version__ and version_info to make them available at the package level
from ._version import __version__, version_info
</patched>
```

In this modification, `version_info` is imported in the package's `__init__.py` file alongside `__version__`. This change makes `version_info` accessible to users of the package, allowing them to perform tuple-based version comparisons easily.

Please adjust these patches to match the actual code in your project. The key idea is to define a `version_info` tuple based on the existing `__version__` string and then expose `version_info` through the package's top-level `__init__.py` file for easy access by users.
