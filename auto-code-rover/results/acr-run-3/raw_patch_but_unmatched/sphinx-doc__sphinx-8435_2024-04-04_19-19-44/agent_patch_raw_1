Based on the context provided and the issue described, it seems that the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration is not being applied to variables and attributes documentation as expected. The provided code snippets and analysis suggest that the handling of `autodoc_type_aliases` is integrated into the documentation process for functions, methods, and classes, but there might be a gap in how these aliases are applied to variables and attributes.

Given the scope of the provided information, a direct patch to address the issue cannot be accurately formulated without making assumptions about parts of the codebase not shown. However, I can propose a hypothetical approach to extend the use of `autodoc_type_aliases` to variables and attributes based on the patterns observed in the methods related to functions and classes.

Please note, the following patch is speculative and intended as an illustrative example based on the information available:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>...</original>
<patched>...
# Assuming there's a method responsible for handling the documentation of variables and attributes
# that currently does not consider `autodoc_type_aliases`. This patch is hypothetical and aims to
# illustrate how one might extend the existing logic to include type aliases for variables and attributes.

def document_variable_or_attribute(self, **kwargs: Any) -> str:
    # Hypothetical method to document a variable or attribute
    type_annotation = get_type_annotation(self.object)
    type_annotation = self.config.autodoc_type_aliases.get(type_annotation, type_annotation)
    # Proceed with documentation process using the possibly aliased type annotation
...
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py</file>
<original>...</original>
<patched>...
# This modification aims to add a test case to verify that `autodoc_type_aliases` is applied to
# variables and attributes, ensuring the patch works as expected.

def test_autodoc_type_aliases_for_variables_and_attributes(app):
    app.config.autodoc_type_aliases = {'CustomType': 'int'}
    options = {"members": None}
    actual = do_autodoc(app, 'module', 'target.some_module', options)
    expected = [
        # Expected documentation output where 'CustomType' is used instead of 'int'
        # for variables and attributes. This is a simplified example.
        '',
        '.. py:data:: some_variable',
        '   :module: target.some_module',
        '   :type: CustomType',
        '',
        '   docstring for some_variable',
        '',
    ]
    assert list(actual) == expected
...
</patched>
```

These modifications are speculative and intended to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the reported issue. Actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the Sphinx codebase, specifically how documentation for variables and attributes is generated, and how type annotations are processed and applied.
