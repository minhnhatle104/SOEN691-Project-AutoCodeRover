Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that creating a direct patch without exact matches from the original program is challenging. However, the issue at hand suggests a need for ensuring that `autodoc_type_aliases` is effectively applied to all relevant parts of the documentation, including variables and attributes.

Without specific code blocks that directly correspond to the handling of variables and attributes in the context of `autodoc_type_aliases`, any attempt to provide a patch would be speculative. The analysis suggests that the integration of `autodoc_type_aliases` with the documentation generation process for variables and attributes is either missing or not functioning as expected.

In a real-world scenario, the resolution would involve a detailed review of the Sphinx codebase, particularly the autodoc extension, to identify where type annotations for variables and attributes are processed. The goal would be to ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` is consulted and applied appropriately during this process.

Given the limitations, I recommend the following general approach for developers working on this issue:

1. **Review the autodoc extension**: Specifically, focus on parts of the code that handle the extraction and documentation of type annotations for variables and attributes. This may involve tracing the documentation generation process from start to finish for these elements.

2. **Ensure `autodoc_type_aliases` application**: Once the relevant code sections are identified, modifications should ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` is applied to type annotations for variables and attributes. This may involve adjusting the logic to consult and apply aliases from `autodoc_type_aliases` wherever type annotations are processed.

3. **Expand test coverage**: Enhance or add tests within `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py` to specifically test the application of `autodoc_type_aliases` to variables and attributes. This would help verify that the issue is resolved and prevent regressions in the future.

Without the ability to provide a direct patch, these steps offer a roadmap for addressing the issue based on the analysis of the provided context and the nature of the reported problem.
