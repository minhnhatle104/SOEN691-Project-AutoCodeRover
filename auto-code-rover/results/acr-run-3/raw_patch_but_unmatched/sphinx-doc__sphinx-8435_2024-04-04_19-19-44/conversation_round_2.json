Specifically, we need to understand how Sphinx's autodoc extension processes type aliases and whether it applies them to variables and attributes documentation.\n\nGiven the information in the issue, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. **Search for the autodoc extension implementation**: Since the issue is related to the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration, we need to understand how this configuration is processed by Sphinx's autodoc extension. However, without direct access to method names or specific implementation details, this might be challenging. A more general approach to understanding how Sphinx processes configuration would be needed, which is not directly achievable through the provided APIs.\n\n2. **Search for the class `MyString`**: This will help us understand if there's any specific handling or documentation within the class that might be relevant to the issue.\n\n3. **Search for variable documentation handling**: Since the issue mentions that `autodoc_type_aliases` does not affect variables, we need to find how variables are documented by autodoc. This is a bit tricky without knowing the exact method names or implementation details, but we can start by searching for code snippets that might be involved in variable documentation.\n\nBased on the above analysis, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"MyString\")`: To get more context on the `MyString` class and its documentation.\n- `search_code(\"autodoc_type_aliases\")`: To find snippets where `autodoc_type_aliases` is referenced or processed, which might give us insights into how type aliases are handled.\n\nThese calls are designed to provide a starting point for understanding the issue's context. Further investigation might be necessary based on the results of these calls."

This could mean that the class is either dynamically generated, not part of the directly accessible codebase, or simply an example provided in the issue description that does not exist in the actual codebase. Given this, focusing on how `autodoc_type_aliases` is supposed to work with type annotations in general would be more productive than focusing on a specific class.\n\n2. **`autodoc_type_aliases` References**: The search for `autodoc_type_aliases` found 15 snippets in the codebase, primarily within `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` (13 matches) and `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py` (2 matches). This indicates that the primary implementation and possibly the handling of `autodoc_type_aliases` are within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, and there are tests related to this configuration in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py`.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps in analyzing the issue should involve:\n\n1. **Reviewing Implementation in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`**: Since this file contains the majority of references to `autodoc_type_aliases`, reviewing the relevant snippets in this file would help understand how type aliases are processed by Sphinx's autodoc extension. Specifically, we should look for how type aliases are applied to variables and attributes documentation, which is the core of the reported issue.\n\n2. **Examining Tests in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py`**: The tests related to `autodoc_type_aliases` might provide insights into the expected behavior and current test coverage regarding type aliases. Understanding the test cases could help identify any gaps in testing, especially related to variables and attributes documentation.\n\nUnfortunately, without direct access to the content of these files or the ability to invoke more detailed API calls targeting specific methods or code snippets within these files, we can't provide specific patches or code changes. However, the analysis suggests that the solution to the reported issue likely involves modifying how `autodoc_type_aliases` is handled in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, ensuring that type aliases are correctly applied to variables and attributes documentation. Additionally, enhancing or adding test cases in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py` to cover these scenarios would be crucial for validating the fix."

        "content": "The search results provide significant insights into how `autodoc_type_aliases` is implemented and tested within the Sphinx project. Here's an analysis based on the provided context:\n\n### Implementation in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\n\nThe `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration is referenced in several methods within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, indicating its involvement in various stages of the autodoc process:\n\n- **`format_args` and `format_signature`**: These methods likely deal with formatting the display of function/method arguments and their signatures in the documentation. The presence of `autodoc_type_aliases` here suggests that type aliases are considered when generating documentation for function signatures.\n\n- **`annotate_to_first_argument`**: This method's name suggests it might be involved in handling type annotations, potentially by applying type aliases to the first argument of functions or methods. The exact behavior would need to be confirmed by reviewing the method's implementation.\n\n- **`_get_signature`**: This method is probably responsible for retrieving the signature of functions or methods, including type annotations. The use of `autodoc_type_aliases` here indicates that type aliases are resolved at this stage.\n\n- **`setup`**: The single match in this method likely relates to the initialization or configuration of `autodoc_type_aliases` within the autodoc extension setup process.\n\n### Testing in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py`\n\nThe test function `test_autodoc_type_aliases` is designed to test the behavior of `autodoc_type_aliases` under different conditions. The snippets indicate that the test checks how type aliases are defined and applied within the autodoc process. However, the provided snippets do not explicitly mention testing the application of type aliases to variables or attributes, which is the core of the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis Summary\n\n- **Bug Locations**: The methods within `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` (`format_args`, `format_signature`, `annotate_to_first_argument`, `_get_signature`) are key areas where the handling of `autodoc_type_aliases` is implemented. These methods are likely where modifications are needed to ensure that type aliases are correctly applied to variables and attributes in the documentation.\n\n- **Testing Gaps**: The test `test_autodoc_type_aliases` in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py` suggests that while there is some testing around type aliases, there might be a gap in testing their application to variables and attributes. Enhancing or adding tests to cover this specific use case would be crucial for validating any fixes and ensuring the issue is resolved.\n\nTo address the reported issue, the next steps would involve reviewing and potentially modifying the implementation in the identified methods within `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to ensure `autodoc_type_aliases` are applied as expected to variables and attributes. Additionally, expanding the test coverage in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py` to explicitly test for this behavior would be necessary to confirm the issue is fully resolved."
