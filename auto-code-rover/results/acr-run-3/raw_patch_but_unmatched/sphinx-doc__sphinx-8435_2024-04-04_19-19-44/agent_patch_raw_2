Given the limitations in directly addressing the specific issue without exact matches to the original program's structure, and considering the speculative nature of the proposed solution, it's clear that a precise patch cannot be provided without further context or access to more of the codebase. 

However, based on the understanding of the issue—that `autodoc_type_aliases` does not affect variables and attributes as expected—a general approach to resolving such an issue would involve ensuring that wherever type annotations for variables and attributes are processed, the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration is consulted to replace or modify those types accordingly.

Without specific sections of the code where this integration is missing, the best course of action would be to review the Sphinx documentation and codebase, particularly focusing on the parts of the code that handle the extraction and processing of type annotations for variables and attributes. Then, developers can ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` is applied consistently across different kinds of documented entities (functions, methods, classes, variables, and attributes).

For anyone working directly on the Sphinx codebase or a similar issue, consider the following steps:

1. **Identify where type annotations are processed**: Look for the code sections where Sphinx extracts and processes type annotations for variables and attributes. This might be in the same areas where functions and methods are handled, or it could be in separate parts of the code dedicated to module or class attributes.

2. **Apply `autodoc_type_aliases` during processing**: Once the relevant sections are identified, ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` is consulted to replace or modify the type annotations according to the aliases defined in the configuration. This might involve modifying functions or methods responsible for generating the documentation strings for variables and attributes.

3. **Test the changes**: Extend or add new tests to verify that `autodoc_type_aliases` is correctly applied to variables and attributes. This would involve creating test cases that define type aliases and ensure they are reflected in the generated documentation for variables and attributes.

Due to the speculative nature of these steps and the absence of specific code sections to modify, it's recommended for developers to approach this issue by thoroughly understanding the relevant parts of the Sphinx codebase and applying changes based on the project's coding practices and architecture.
