Given the constraints and the information provided, creating a precise patch without direct access to the specific implementation details of the project's codebase is challenging. However, I'll provide a general approach to addressing the issue of confusing assertion rewriting messages for byte strings, focusing on enhancing the clarity of these messages. This approach is conceptual and would need to be adapted to fit the actual code and architecture of your project.

Since the specific locations and original code snippets cannot be accurately identified without direct access to the codebase, the following is a hypothetical patch that aims to improve the error messages for byte string comparisons by including a more readable representation of byte strings.

**Please adapt the following conceptual modifications to fit the actual implementation details of your project:**

# modification 1
```python
<file>path/to/your/assertion/rewrite/module.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet where byte string comparison assertion errors are generated
def generate_assertion_error_message(expected, actual):
    return f"assert {expected} == {actual}"
</original>
<patched>
def format_byte_string(bs):
    """Provide a clearer representation of byte strings in assertion errors."""
    if isinstance(bs, bytes):
        return " ".join([f"{b:02x}" for b in bs]) + f" ({bs})"
    return bs

def generate_assertion_error_message(expected, actual):
    expected_formatted = format_byte_string(expected)
    actual_formatted = format_byte_string(actual)
    return f"assert {expected_formatted} == {actual_formatted}"
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>path/to/different/module/handling/errors.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet involved in handling and displaying assertion errors
def display_error_message(error_message):
    print(f"Error: {error_message}")
</original>
<patched>
def display_error_message(error_message):
    # Enhanced error message display logic (if applicable)
    print(f"Error: {error_message}")
    # Additional logic to handle byte string representations could be added here
</patched>
```

These modifications introduce a hypothetical function `format_byte_string` to format byte strings into a more readable representation, including both their hexadecimal values and the original byte string. This function is then used in a hypothetical `generate_assertion_error_message` function to ensure that byte strings are presented clearly when generating assertion error messages.

Please note, these modifications are conceptual and intended to illustrate a potential approach to improving the clarity of assertion error messages involving byte strings. The actual implementation would need to be adapted to fit the specific details and architecture of your project, including the correct file paths, original code snippets, and the structure of the assertion handling and error reporting mechanisms.
