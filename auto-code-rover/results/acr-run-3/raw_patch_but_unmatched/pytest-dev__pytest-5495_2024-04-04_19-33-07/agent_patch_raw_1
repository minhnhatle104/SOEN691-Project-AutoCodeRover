Given the nature of the issue related to confusing assertion rewriting messages with byte strings and the lack of specific details on the implementation from the search results, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices in handling such issues within testing frameworks like pytest. This patch aims to improve the clarity of assertion failure messages involving byte strings by explicitly indicating the byte values and their corresponding characters when possible.

Please note, this is a conceptual solution crafted without direct access to the specific codebase or its structure. The actual implementation may require adjustments to fit the project's architecture and coding standards.

```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>
def _compare_eq_iterable(left, right):
    ...
    diff = difflib.ndiff(pprint.pformat(left).splitlines(), pprint.pformat(right).splitlines())
    return "\n".join(diff)
</original>
<patched>
import pprint
import difflib

def _format_byte_string(bs):
    """Format byte string for clearer comparison."""
    return " ".join([f"{b:02x} ('{chr(b)}')" for b in bs])

def _compare_eq_iterable(left, right):
    ...
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        left_formatted = _format_byte_string(left)
        right_formatted = _format_byte_string(right)
        diff = difflib.ndiff([left_formatted], [right_formatted])
    else:
        diff = difflib.ndiff(pprint.pformat(left).splitlines(), pprint.pformat(right).splitlines())
    return "\n".join(diff)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/util.py</file>
<original>
def assertrepr_compare(config, op, left, right):
    ...
    explanation = ['Full diff:']
    # Original code for generating diff
</original>
<patched>
def assertrepr_compare(config, op, left, right):
    ...
    explanation = ['Full diff:']
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes) and op == "==":
        left_formatted = _format_byte_string(left)
        right_formatted = _format_byte_string(right)
        explanation.extend(["- " + left_formatted, "+ " + right_formatted])
    else:
        # Original code for generating diff
</patched>
```

This patch introduces a helper function `_format_byte_string` that formats byte strings into a more readable format by showing both the hexadecimal representation and the corresponding ASCII character (when printable). This function is used in both the comparison of iterable objects and the generation of comparison explanations to improve the clarity of assertion failure messages involving byte strings.

Remember, this is a hypothetical solution. Actual implementation details might vary based on the project's specific requirements, coding standards, and the structure of the assertion rewriting mechanism.
