Specifically, we should look into how differences between expected and actual values are interpreted and formatted. Therefore, additional context is needed to pinpoint the source of the confusing error messages. Constructing search API calls to explore the error formatting mechanism would be beneficial:\n  - `search_code(\"error message formatting\")`\n  - `search_code(\"assertion failure message\")`\n  - `search_code(\"difference interpretation\")`\n\n- **where are bug locations:**\n  Without the additional context specifically related to the generation and formatting of error messages during assertion failures, we do not have enough information to identify the exact locations of the bug. The provided context focuses on the infrastructure for assertion rewriting and optimization, rather than on how error messages are generated and presented."
