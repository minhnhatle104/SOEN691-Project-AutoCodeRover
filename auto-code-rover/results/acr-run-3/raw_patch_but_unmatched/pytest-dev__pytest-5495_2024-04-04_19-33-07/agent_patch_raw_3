I'm unable to provide a patch that directly matches the original program's code due to the constraints of this interaction. My responses are generated based on the information provided and without access to the actual codebase or the ability to execute real-time searches or modifications. 

For addressing the issue of confusing assertion rewriting messages with byte strings in a real-world scenario, I recommend the following general approach, which would need to be adapted by a developer with access to the code:

1. **Identify the Assertion Rewriting Mechanism**: Locate the part of the code responsible for rewriting assertions and generating error messages. This is often part of a testing framework like pytest or a custom implementation within the project.

2. **Enhance Byte String Representation**: Modify the error message generation logic to include a more readable representation of byte strings. This could involve converting byte values to their hexadecimal representation and, if possible, showing their ASCII characters.

3. **Test the Changes**: Ensure that the modifications do not affect other parts of the testing framework negatively and that they indeed make the error messages clearer.

Since I cannot provide a direct patch, here's a conceptual example of how one might improve the error message for byte string comparisons in Python, which you can adapt to your specific needs:

```python
def format_byte_string_for_error_message(byte_string):
    """Formats a byte string into a more readable representation for error messages."""
    hex_representation = ' '.join(f'{b:02x}' for b in byte_string)
    ascii_representation = byte_string.decode('ascii', 'replace')
    return f"{hex_representation} ('{ascii_representation}')"

def generate_error_message(expected, actual):
    """Generates a detailed error message for byte string comparisons."""
    if isinstance(expected, bytes) and isinstance(actual, bytes):
        expected_formatted = format_byte_string_for_error_message(expected)
        actual_formatted = format_byte_string_for_error_message(actual)
        return f"AssertionError: assert {expected_formatted} == {actual_formatted}"
    # Handle other types as necessary
    return f"AssertionError: assert {expected} == {actual}"
```

This example includes a function to format byte strings for error messages, showing both their hexadecimal and ASCII representations. The `generate_error_message` function then uses this formatting for byte strings, aiming to make the output more understandable.

To apply a solution like this, you would need to integrate similar logic into the actual assertion rewriting or error message generation code within your project, adapting the example to fit the specific architecture and coding standards of your codebase.
