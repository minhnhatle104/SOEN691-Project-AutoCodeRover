Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details or the ability to execute real modifications, providing an exact patch that matches the original program precisely is not feasible. However, I can offer a conceptual approach to address the issue based on common practices in handling pretty printing and vector operations in Python, specifically within the context of the SymPy library.

### Conceptual Approach to Addressing the Pretty Printing Issue

The issue described involves the pretty printing of `sympy.vector` objects, where the output gets jumbled, particularly with the insertion of unit vectors in unexpected places. This suggests that the problem may lie in the way these objects are converted to strings for display.

#### Suggested Modifications (Conceptual)

1. **Enhance String Representation of Vector Components**

For `CoordSys3D` objects, ensuring that the string representation (`_sympystr`) of each component (including unit vectors) is clearly defined and does not conflict with the pretty printing logic.

2. **Refine Pretty Printing Logic for Integrals Involving Vectors**

For the `Integral` class, it may be necessary to adjust the pretty printing logic to handle integrals of vector fields more gracefully. This could involve detecting when the integral expression involves a vector and applying a custom formatting rule.

3. **Review and Adjust Pretty Printing Configuration**

The initialization and configuration of the pretty printing system (`init_printing`) should be reviewed to ensure that it supports the enhanced formatting logic for vectors and integrals. This may involve setting specific options or flags that influence how these objects are rendered.

### Example Conceptual Patch

Since an exact match to the original program cannot be provided, below is a conceptual description of changes that could be explored:

- **For `CoordSys3D` objects**: Review the `_sympystr` method to ensure that the representation of unit vectors is consistent and clear. This may involve explicitly formatting the string output to distinguish these vectors clearly.

- **For `Integral` expressions involving vectors**: Implement a check within the pretty printing logic to detect vector fields within integrals. If detected, apply a formatting rule that correctly aligns and displays the vector components.

- **For pretty printing configuration**: Ensure that `init_printing` includes options or flags that enable the enhanced formatting for vector fields and integrals. This could involve adding parameters to the `init_printing` function that allow developers to opt-in to this enhanced formatting.

These conceptual changes aim to address the root causes of the pretty printing issue by ensuring clear and consistent formatting for vector components and integrals, as well as providing configurable options for developers to control how these objects are displayed.
