Specifically, we should look into how `pretty_print` (or `pprint`), `CoordSys3D`, `Del`, and the `Integral` class are implemented and how they interact with each other, especially in the context of printing or rendering output in the terminal.\n\nHere are the API calls that would help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the class `CoordSys3D` to understand how coordinate system objects are defined and how they might affect printing.\n2. Search for the class `Del` to understand the operations it supports and how it interacts with `CoordSys3D` objects, especially in the context of cross products and their printing.\n3. Since `pretty_print` or `pprint` is likely a function rather than a method of a specific class, we should search for the method `pprint` to understand how it handles different types of objects, especially sympy vectors and integrals.\n4. Search for the class `Integral` to understand how integrals are represented and printed, which seems to be part of the issue based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_class(\"CoordSys3D\")\n- search_class(\"Del\")\n- search_method(\"pprint\")\n- search_class(\"Integral\")"
