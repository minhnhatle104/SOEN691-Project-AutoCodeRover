The files are:\n   - `tests/admin_widgets/models.py`\n   - `tests/update_only_fields/models.py`\n   - `tests/admin_inlines/models.py`\n   - `tests/model_inheritance_regress/models.py`\n   - `tests/defer_regress/models.py`\n   - `tests/get_or_create/models.py`\n\n2. **No Direct Findings for `Capability` Class or `default` Method**: The search for the `default` method within a class named `Capability` returned no results.

This could be due to the possibility that the migration files are dynamically generated and might not be directly searchable in the codebase, or the specific migration file that contains this snippet was not indexed or accessible by the search API.\n\nGiven these findings, the issue seems to be more complex than initially anticipated. The lack of direct findings for the `Capability` class and the `default` method suggests that we might need to manually inspect the files containing the `Profile` class to understand how the `Capability` nested class is defined and used. Additionally, the absence of the specific migration code snippet in the search results indicates that understanding the migration generation process might require a closer look at the Django model and migration framework, especially how it handles default values for fields.\n\nTo move forward, we might need to:\n- Manually inspect the files listed to find the correct `Profile` model that matches the description in the issue.\n- Review Django's documentation or source code related to migrations and default field values to understand potential limitations or requirements when using class methods from nested classes as defaults.\n- Consider alternative approaches to defining default values that are compatible with Django's migration system.\n\nWithout direct access to the codebase or the ability to perform additional searches, these steps provide a logical path forward based on the information we have."
