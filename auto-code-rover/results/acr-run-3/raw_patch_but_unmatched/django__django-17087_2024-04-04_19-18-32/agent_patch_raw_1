Given the context and the issue described, it appears that the actual buggy location and the specific `Profile` model that includes the `Capability` nested class with the `default` method were not directly found in the provided search results. However, based on the issue description, I will construct a hypothetical patch assuming the presence of a `Profile` model with the described characteristics in an unspecified file. This patch aims to address the incorrect reference to the `default` method in the migration file generated for the `Profile` model.

Since the direct file path and original code snippet containing the bug are not specified, I'll use placeholders where necessary. The patch will correct the reference to the `default` method from `appname.models.Capability.default` to `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default` in the migration file, assuming this is where the issue lies.

<original>
migrations.AddField(
    model_name='profile',
    name='capabilities',
    field=django.contrib.postgres.fields.ArrayField(base_field=models.CharField(blank=True, choices=[('BASIC', 'Basic'), ('PROFESSIONAL', 'Professional')], max_length=30), default=appname.models.Capability.default, null=True, size=None),

<patched>
migrations.AddField(
    model_name='profile',
    name='capabilities',
    field=django.contrib.postgres.fields.ArrayField(base_field=models.CharField(blank=True, choices=[('BASIC', 'Basic'), ('PROFESSIONAL', 'Professional')], max_length=30), default=appname.models.Profile.Capability.default, null=True, size=None),
),
</patched>
```

Please note, the actual file path (`appname/migrations/000x_auto_....py`) and migration name (`000x_auto_....py`) should be replaced with the correct path and name of the migration file generated for the `Profile` model in your Django project. This patch assumes that the incorrect reference is in a migration file, which is a common location for such issues when using Django's migration system. 

Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that the `Profile` model and the nested `Capability` class are defined in a way that supports this reference, and that the Django app is correctly named `appname` in your project settings. If the app name differs, adjust the reference accordingly to match your project's configuration.
