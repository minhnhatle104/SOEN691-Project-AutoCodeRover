Given the information from the issue, we will focus on these specific elements. Here are the API calls that would be most relevant to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"sympify\")`: This will help us understand how the `sympify` function is implemented and how it handles the `evaluate` parameter.\n2. `search_method(\"simplify\")`: This call will provide insights into the `simplify` method's implementation, which seems to behave inconsistently between versions when used with `ceiling`.\n3. `search_class(\"ceiling\")`: Since the issue involves the `ceiling` function, understanding its implementation and how it interacts with `sympify` and `simplify` could be crucial.\n4. `search_code(\"evaluate=False\")`: This will help us find instances where the `evaluate` parameter is specifically used, which might give us clues on its impact on expressions involving `ceiling`.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how these methods and the `ceiling` function are supposed to work together and might highlight changes or inconsistencies between the versions mentioned in the issue."
