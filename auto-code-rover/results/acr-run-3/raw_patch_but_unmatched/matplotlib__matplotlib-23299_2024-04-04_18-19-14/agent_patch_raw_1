Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem arises due to the interaction between `rc_context` and the backend state, particularly how `rcParams` are temporarily changed and then reverted. However, without a clear indication that `rc_context` or `get_backend` themselves are malfunctioning, the issue might be more about how the state of `Gcf.figs` is managed or preserved during these operations.

Since we don't have a direct bug in the provided methods but rather an interaction issue, a hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that the state of `Gcf.figs` is correctly managed when `rcParams` are temporarily changed. This could involve adding checks or mechanisms to preserve the figures' state or to ensure that operations like `get_backend()` do not inadvertently affect `Gcf.figs`. However, without a specific bug in the code snippets provided, the patch would be speculative.

Given this, a speculative patch might look like ensuring `Gcf.figs` is not affected by changes in the backend or `rcParams`:

# modification 1

<patched>
# This is a speculative patch and might not directly apply without further context
# The idea is to add a mechanism to preserve the figures' state in Gcf when rcParams are changed

class Gcf:
    # Existing code...
    
    @classmethod
    def preserve_figs_state(cls):
        """Preserve the current state of figures."""
        cls._preserved_figs = cls.figs.copy()
    
    @classmethod
    def restore_figs_state(cls):
        """Restore the figures to their preserved state."""
        if hasattr(cls, '_preserved_figs'):
            cls.figs = cls._preserved_figs
            del cls._preserved_figs
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>...</original>
<patched>
# Integrating the preservation and restoration of Gcf.figs state with rc_context

def rc_context(rc=None, fname=None):
    """
    Return a context manager for temporarily changing rcParams.
    """
    from . import _pylab_helpers
    orig = rcParams.copy()
    try:
        _pylab_helpers.Gcf.preserve_figs_state()  # Preserve the state before changes
        if fname:
            rc_file(fname)
        if rc:
            rcParams.update(rc)
        yield
    finally:
        dict.update(rcParams, orig)  # Revert to the original rcs.
        _pylab_helpers.Gcf.restore_figs_state()  # Restore the figures' state
</patched>
```

This speculative patch introduces a mechanism to preserve and restore the state of figures managed by `Gcf` during the execution of `rc_context`. It's important to note that this solution is hypothetical and would need to be tested and validated within the actual Matplotlib codebase to ensure it addresses the issue without introducing new problems.
