Given the information from the issue, it's clear that the `Q` class has an `__and__` method that doesn't handle the `Exists` object correctly when it's on the right side of the `&` operator. It's also suggested that a `__rand__` method might be missing, which could be the root cause of the issue since `__rand__` is called when the left operand does not have an `__and__` method, or when the left operand's `__and__` method does not know how to handle the right operand.\n\nLet's gather more context about the `Q` and `Exists` classes, and specifically look for the implementation of `__and__`, `__or__`, `__rand__`, and `__ror__` methods within these classes.\n\n1.

Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n1. **`Q` Class**:\n   - Located in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`.\n   - Inherits from `tree.Node`.\n   - Implements logical operations such as `__or__` and `__and__` for combining query expressions.\n   - The `__and__` method combines `self` with another instance using the `_combine` method with `AND` as the connector.\n   - There is no implementation of `__rand__` found in the `Q` class.\n\n2. **`Exists` Class**:\n   - Located in `django/db/models/expressions.py`.\n   - Inherits from `Subquery`.\n   - Primarily used to construct an SQL EXISTS clause.\n   - There is no direct implementation of bitwise operations like `__and__`, `__or__`, `__rand__`, or `__ror__`.\n\n3. **Issue Analysis**:\n   - The reported issue is that `Q() & Exists(...)` works as expected, but `Exists(...) & Q()` raises a `TypeError`.\n   - This behavior suggests that while `Q` knows how to handle an `Exists` expression on its right (through the `__and__` method), the reverse operation fails because `Exists` does not know how to handle a `Q` expression on its right, and there is no `__rand__` method in `Q` to handle the operation when `Q` is on the right.\n\n4. **Solution Direction**:\n   - To make the operation commutative, we need to ensure that both `Q & Exists` and `Exists & Q` operations are handled gracefully.\n   - Since `Q` lacks a `__rand__` method, implementing this method could resolve the issue. The `__rand__` method should be able to handle cases where a `Q` object is on the right side of the `&` operator.\n   - Additionally, checking if the `Exists` class should implement `__and__` and `__or__` methods (or their reverse counterparts `__rand__` and `__ror__`) could also be considered to ensure full commutativity of these operations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve drafting a patch to implement the `__rand__` method in the `Q` class to handle cases where `Q` is on the right side of the `&` operator with an `Exists` expression on the left. Additionally, we should consider whether modifications to the `Exists` class are necessary for handling bitwise operations directly."
