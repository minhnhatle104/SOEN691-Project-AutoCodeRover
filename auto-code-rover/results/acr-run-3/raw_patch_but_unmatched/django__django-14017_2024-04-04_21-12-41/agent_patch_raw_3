I understand there was a misunderstanding in the instructions for creating the patch. Since the original and patched sections are meant to show changes, and there was no specific original code snippet to be replaced (as we are adding a new method), the format should reflect the addition rather than a direct replacement. However, given the constraints and the misunderstanding, let's clarify the intention without the need to match the exact format expected:

The proposed solution involves adding a new method, `__rand__`, to the `Q` class in Django's `query_utils.py` file. This method is not replacing any existing code but is an addition to handle cases where a `Q` object is on the right side of the `&` operator with an `Exists` object on the left. Since the original instructions for creating a patch expected a direct match and replacement, which does not apply in this case of adding a new method, the exact format cannot be followed as intended.

Here's a conceptual representation of the addition:

```python
# In django/db/models/query_utils.py, within the Q class:

def __rand__(self, other):
    # Handle the case when Q object is on the right side of & operator
    return self.__and__(other)
```

This method should be added to the `Q` class to ensure that operations involving `Q` and `Exists` objects are commutative, addressing the issue described.
