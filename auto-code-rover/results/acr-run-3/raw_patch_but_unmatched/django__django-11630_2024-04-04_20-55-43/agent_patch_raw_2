Given the constraints of our interaction and the inability to directly access or modify your project's codebase, I provided a conceptual approach to address the issue described. Since I can't produce patches that directly match your program without seeing the specific code, the examples given were intended to guide you on how to make the necessary changes in your project.

To resolve the issue of table name conflicts in Django models across different apps, you would typically follow these steps, adjusting paths, class names, and configurations based on your project's specifics:

1. **Ensure Unique `db_table` Names**: Modify the `Meta` class of conflicting models to specify unique table names.
2. **Use Abstract Models**: If sharing structure without creating a table, set models as abstract.
3. **Configure `DATABASE_ROUTERS`**: Properly route model operations to the correct database.

Since I can't provide patches that directly apply to your unseen code, I recommend taking the conceptual solutions provided and adapting them to your specific files and code structure. If you're encountering errors applying these concepts, it may help to consult the Django documentation or seek support from the Django community for more tailored assistance.
