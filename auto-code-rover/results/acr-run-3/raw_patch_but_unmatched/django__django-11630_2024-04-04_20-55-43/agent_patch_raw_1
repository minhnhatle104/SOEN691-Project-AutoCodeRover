Given the nature of the issue described and without direct access to specific file paths, model names, or configurations from the project, I'll provide a conceptual patch that addresses the common scenario of resolving table name conflicts across different Django apps. This solution will focus on ensuring unique `db_table` names and setting up abstract models where applicable. Please adapt the file paths and code snippets to fit your project's structure and naming conventions.

### Modification 1: Ensure Unique `db_table` Names

If the conflict arises because different models unintentionally use the same table name, you can resolve this by specifying unique `db_table` names in the `Meta` class of each model.

```python
<file>app1/models.py</file>
<original>
class ModelName(models.Model):
    # model fields

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'shared_table_name'
</original>
<patched>
class ModelName(models.Model):
    # model fields

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'app1_specific_table_name'
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Use Abstract Models to Share Structure

If the models are intended to share structure but not the database table, making the base model abstract will prevent Django from creating a table for it. Derived models will not inherit the `db_table` attribute, avoiding the conflict.

```python
<file>base/models.py</file>
<original>
class BaseModel(models.Model):
    # shared fields

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'should_not_be_shared'
</original>
<patched>
class BaseModel(models.Model):
    # shared fields

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
</patched>
```

### Modification 3: Adjusting `DATABASE_ROUTERS` Configuration

If your project uses multiple databases and the issue is due to incorrect routing, ensuring that your `DATABASE_ROUTERS` setting correctly directs model operations to the appropriate database can help. This modification assumes you need to implement or adjust a database router.

```python
<file>project/settings.py</file>
<original>
DATABASE_ROUTERS = ['path.to.CurrentRouter']
</original>
<patched>
DATABASE_ROUTERS = ['path.to.CurrentRouter', 'path.to.NewAppSpecificRouter']
</patched>
```

And then, in your new router:

```python
<file>project/routers/NewAppSpecificRouter.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming this is a new file, there would be no original code.
</original>
<patched>
class NewAppSpecificRouter:
    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        if model._meta.app_label == 'app2':
            return 'app2_db'
        return None

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        if model._meta.app_label == 'app2':
            return 'app2_db'
        return None

    def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):
        if app_label == 'app2':
            return db == 'app2_db'
        return None
</patched>
```

Please note that these modifications are conceptual and need to be adapted to fit the specific details of your project, including the correct file paths, model names, and database configurations.
