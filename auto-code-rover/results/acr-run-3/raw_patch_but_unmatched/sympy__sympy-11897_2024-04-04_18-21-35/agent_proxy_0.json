The issue mentions inconsistencies between the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer when dealing with expressions like `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. To get more context and find potential places for fixes, we should look into the implementation of both printers and how they handle these specific cases.\n\nLet's start by searching for the classes or methods responsible for LaTeX and pretty printing. We can also look for the specific code snippets mentioned in the issue to see where they are handled in the codebase.\n\n1. Search for the class or method responsible for LaTeX printing.\n2.
