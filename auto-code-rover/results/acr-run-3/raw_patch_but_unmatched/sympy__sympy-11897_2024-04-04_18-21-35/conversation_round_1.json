        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered some valuable context regarding the issue at hand. Let's analyze the findings:\n\n1. **LaTeX Printer Implementation**:\n   - Found in `sympy/printing/latex.py`.\n   - The `latex` function is responsible for converting expressions to LaTeX representation. It accepts an expression and settings as arguments.\n   - The function documentation provides examples of how different settings affect the LaTeX output, such as `mode`, `fold_frac_powers`, `fold_func_brackets`, `long_frac_ratio`, and more.\n   - This function uses `LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)` to generate the LaTeX string.\n\n2. **Pretty Printer (pprint) Implementation**:\n   - The search did not find a specific method named `pprint` in the codebase. This might indicate that pretty printing is handled differently or is part of a larger system that wasn't directly identified by the search term used.\n\n3. **Code Snippets**:\n   - The expression `exp(-x)*log(x)` was found in a test case within `sympy/integrals/tests/test_integrals.py`, indicating it's used for testing integral simplification. This doesn't directly relate to printing but confirms the expression's relevance in the codebase.\n   - The expression `1/(x + y)/2` was found in `sympy/printing/tests/test_latex.py` as part of a test case for LaTeX printing. The test case checks that the LaTeX representation of `1/(x + y)/2` is correctly output as `\"\\frac{1}{2 \\left(x + y\\right)}\"`.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The inconsistency between LaTeX and pretty printing as described in the issue might stem from how these printers handle expressions and their settings. Given that pretty printing wasn't directly found, it's possible it relies on a different mechanism or defaults compared to LaTeX printing.\n- The LaTeX printer has various settings that can influence its output, such as `fold_frac_powers`, `fold_func_brackets`, and `long_frac_ratio`. These settings could potentially lead to differences in output compared to pretty printing if not aligned properly.\n- The test cases found for both expressions indicate that these specific cases are considered in tests, but the issue might lie in how settings are applied or in the inherent differences in capabilities between LaTeX and pretty printing.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Investigate how pretty printing is implemented or handled in the codebase to understand its mechanism better.\n- Review the settings and defaults used by both printers when generating output for expressions to identify any discrepancies.\n- Consider aligning the settings or enhancing the printers to handle expressions consistently, keeping in mind the unique capabilities of LaTeX that might allow for \"better\" output in some cases."
