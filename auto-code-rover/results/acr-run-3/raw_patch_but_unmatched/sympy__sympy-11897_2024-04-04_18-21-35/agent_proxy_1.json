This could provide insights into why the outputs between the LaTeX and pretty printers differ and whether these differences are due to implementation details or configuration settings. Therefore, more context is needed.\n\n  ```plaintext\n  search_method(\"pretty_print\")\n  search_code(\"pprint\")\n  ```\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n  - **Buggy files and methods**:\n    - File: `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n      - Method: `latex`\n        - This method is responsible for converting expressions to LaTeX representation. The inconsistencies mentioned in the issue suggest that either the settings used by this method or its handling of certain expressions might not align with the pretty printer's output.\n    - Since we couldn't directly find the implementation details of the pretty printer (`pprint`), it's challenging to pinpoint a specific location for bugs on that side without further context. However, the inconsistency likely arises from how these two printers are configured or their inherent implementation differences."
