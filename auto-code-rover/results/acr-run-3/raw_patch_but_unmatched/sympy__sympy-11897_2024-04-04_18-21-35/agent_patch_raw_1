Given the issue description and the context retrieved, the core of the issue seems to be about ensuring consistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers in terms of their output. Since the LaTeX printer (`latex`) and the pretty printer (`pretty_print`) have different settings and defaults, achieving exact consistency for all expressions might not be feasible without a detailed review of both printers' settings and outputs. However, we can propose a patch to add a note or warning in the documentation of both methods, advising users about potential inconsistencies and suggesting checking both printers' settings for more aligned outputs. This approach doesn't directly "fix" the inconsistency but provides users with information to manage their expectations and use the printers more effectively.

Convert the given expression to LaTeX representation.

Note: The output of the LaTeX printer might differ from the pretty printer due to different default settings and the inherent capabilities of LaTeX. Users are advised to review the settings of both printers to achieve more consistent outputs between them.

This approach ensures that users are made aware of the potential differences in output between the two printers and encourages them to adjust settings as needed to achieve their desired output. It's a non-intrusive way to address the issue without altering the underlying functionality of the printers, which might have broader implications across the SymPy codebase.
