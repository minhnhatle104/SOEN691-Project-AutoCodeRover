Given the constraints and the nature of the interaction, where specific file paths and original code snippets are not provided, creating a precise patch that directly applies to the original program is challenging. However, I can offer a conceptual patch based on common Django patterns and the described issue. This conceptual patch should be adapted to fit the actual codebase.

Since the issue revolves around handling `ModelForm` fields with callable defaults and specifically involves issues with `ArrayField` validation in Django admin inlines, the conceptual patch will focus on ensuring proper validation and handling of default values.

### Conceptual Patch

#### Ensuring Proper Validation and Handling of `ArrayField` in Inline Forms

**Objective**: Modify the inline form handling to ensure that `ArrayField` validation errors are not bypassed upon resubmitting the form without modifications.

**Approach**:
1. Override the inline formset to customize the handling of `show_hidden_initial`.
2. Ensure that the custom validation logic in the form is executed consistently across submissions.

Since I cannot provide exact matches for the original program, below is a conceptual guide on how to implement these changes:

### Conceptual Modification 1: Customizing Inline Formset

```python
# Assuming the file path as my_app/admin.py for the inline definition

# Original inline definition might not explicitly handle formset behavior related to `show_hidden_initial`

# Conceptual Patch
from django.contrib import admin
from django.forms.models import BaseInlineFormSet

class CustomInlineFormSet(BaseInlineFormSet):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        for form in self.forms:
            form.fields['plop'].widget.attrs['show_hidden_initial'] = False

class RelatedModelInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = RelatedModel
    formset = CustomInlineFormSet
    # Other configurations remain unchanged
```

### Conceptual Modification 2: Ensuring Custom Validation Logic

```python
# Assuming the file path as my_app/forms.py for the form definition

# Original form definition with custom clean method

# Conceptual Patch
from django import forms
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

class RelatedModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(RelatedModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['plop'].show_hidden_initial = False

    def clean(self):
        # Your custom validation logic
        raise ValidationError("whatever")
        # Ensure the custom validation logic is correctly applied
```

### Note:
- These modifications are conceptual and aim to address the issue based on the description provided. The actual implementation may require adjustments based on the specific details of your codebase, such as the correct field names and the structure of your models and forms.
- It's crucial to adapt the field name `'plop'` and any other specific details to match those in your actual project.
- Testing these changes in a development environment before applying them to production is essential to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new problems.

This approach provides a starting point for addressing the validation issue with `ArrayField` in Django admin inline forms, based on the general understanding of Django's forms and admin framework.
