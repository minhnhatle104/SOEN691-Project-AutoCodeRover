Given the context of the issue related to Django's admin interface, specifically with handling `ModelForm` fields, callable defaults, and the peculiar behavior of `ArrayField` in inline forms, let's propose a patch. This patch aims to address the problem where validation errors are bypassed upon resubmitting a form without modifications, particularly in the scenario involving `ArrayField` and custom form validation logic.

Since the exact file paths and original code snippets were not provided, I'll create a hypothetical patch based on standard Django patterns and the issue description. This patch will focus on ensuring that `show_hidden_initial` is correctly handled to prevent bypassing validation errors on second submission.

# modification 1
```python
<file>my_app/admin.py</file>
<original>
class RelatedModelInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = RelatedModel
    form = RelatedModelForm
    extra = 1
</original>
<patched>
class RelatedModelInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = RelatedModel
    form = RelatedModelForm
    extra = 1

    def get_formset(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):
        formset = super().get_formset(request, obj, **kwargs)
        for form in formset.form.base_fields.values():
            form.show_hidden_initial = False
        return formset
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>my_app/forms.py</file>
<original>
class RelatedModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def clean(self):
        raise ValidationError("whatever")
</original>
<patched>
class RelatedModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(RelatedModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        for field in self.fields.values():
            field.show_hidden_initial = False

    def clean(self):
        raise ValidationError("whatever")
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by explicitly setting `show_hidden_initial` to `False` for all fields in the `RelatedModelForm` and within the `RelatedModelInline`. This approach ensures that the initial hidden values are not used in a way that bypasses validation upon resubmitting the form, addressing the core of the reported issue.

Please note, these patches are based on a hypothetical understanding of the issue and the standard Django admin and forms framework. Depending on the specific project structure and Django version, adjustments may be necessary.
