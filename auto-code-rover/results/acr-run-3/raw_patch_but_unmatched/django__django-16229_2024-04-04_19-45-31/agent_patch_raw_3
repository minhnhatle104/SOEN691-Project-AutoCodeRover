Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it's clear that creating a precise and directly applicable patch without specific details about the original program's structure and code is challenging. However, I'll provide a more generalized approach to addressing the issue described, focusing on the principles that should guide the resolution. This approach should be adapted to fit the actual codebase.

### Generalized Approach to Addressing the Issue

The issue described involves handling `ModelForm` fields with callable defaults, specifically related to `ArrayField` validation in Django admin inlines, where validation errors are bypassed upon resubmitting the form without modifications. The goal is to ensure that validation errors are properly displayed and that default values are correctly handled.

#### Key Principles for the Patch:

1. **Ensure `show_hidden_initial` is correctly set for fields in inline forms**: This is crucial for handling cases where the form is resubmitted without modifications, especially after a validation error.

2. **Customize form validation to consistently enforce rules**: Custom validation logic should be reviewed to ensure it behaves as expected across submissions.

Given the lack of specific file paths, class names, or method details, below is a conceptual guide on how to implement changes based on common Django patterns. This guide assumes familiarity with Django's `ModelForm`, `InlineModelAdmin`, and form validation mechanisms.

### Conceptual Guide for Implementation

#### Customizing Inline Formset to Handle `show_hidden_initial`

```python
# In your Django app's admin.py or a similar file where your admin classes are defined.

from django.contrib import admin
from django.forms.models import BaseInlineFormSet, inlineformset_factory

class CustomInlineFormSet(BaseInlineFormSet):
    def add_fields(self, form, index):
        super(CustomInlineFormSet, self).add_fields(form, index)
        # Assuming 'plop' is the field with the issue
        form.fields['plop'].widget.is_hidden = False  # Adjusting widget's hidden attribute

# Use this custom formset in your InlineModelAdmin
class RelatedModelInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = RelatedModel
    formset = CustomInlineFormSet
    # Other configurations as needed
```

#### Ensuring Custom Validation Logic is Applied Consistently

```python
# In your forms.py or wherever your form classes are defined.

from django import forms
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

class RelatedModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = RelatedModel
        fields = '__all__'

    def clean(self):
        # Example custom validation logic
        cleaned_data = super().clean()
        plop = cleaned_data.get("plop")
        if not plop:  # Example condition, adjust based on actual validation needs
            raise ValidationError("Plop is required.")
        return cleaned_data
```

### Note:
- The above code snippets are conceptual and aim to illustrate the approach to solving the described issue. They should be adapted to match the actual models, fields, and validation logic in your project.
- Testing in a development environment is crucial before applying any changes to your production codebase.

This generalized approach provides a framework for addressing the issue with form validation and handling of default values in Django admin inline forms. Adjustments may be necessary based on the specifics of your Django version and project setup.
