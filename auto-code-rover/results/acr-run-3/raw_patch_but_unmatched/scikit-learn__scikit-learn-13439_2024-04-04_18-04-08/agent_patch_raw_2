Given the structure of the `Pipeline` class as retrieved, it appears there was no specific "original" code snippet to replace since the task was to add a new method (`__len__`) that did not previously exist in the class. The patch should introduce this new method to provide the length of the pipeline, which corresponds to the number of steps it contains. Here is the corrected format for adding a new method without replacing an existing one:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/pipeline.py</file>
<original>
</original>
<patched>    def __len__(self):
        """Returns the total number of steps in the pipeline."""
        return len(self.steps)
</patched>
```
