Given the constraints and the information provided, it seems we are unable to directly locate and modify the specific implementation details of the `get_FOO_display()` method or the exact location of the models within the project's codebase. The initial guidance provided was intended to offer a conceptual solution based on common Django patterns and the description of the issue.

Without direct access to the specific implementation details or the ability to interact with the project's codebase in real-time, providing a precise patch that matches the original program exactly is challenging. However, I can refine the conceptual solution to be more generic, hoping it might guide you towards implementing a suitable fix within your project's context.

Since the direct modification approach was not successful, let's consider a more generic solution that could be adapted to your specific project structure and files. This solution still focuses on addressing the issue with the `get_FOO_display()` method not correctly handling inherited choices.

### Conceptual Solution:

1. **Override the `get_FOO_display()` Method in the Child Model**: This involves creating a custom method in the child model that correctly handles the extended choices before falling back to the default behavior.

2. **Ensure the Method Checks Both Sets of Choices**: The custom method should first check the child model's choices for a match. If no match is found, it should then check the parent model's choices.

3. **Fallback to Default Behavior if No Match is Found**: If the value does not match any custom choices, the method should fallback to the default implementation to ensure compatibility with the base model's choices.

### Generic Patch Template:

Since we cannot directly modify the original program, below is a more generic template that you might adapt:

```python
# Assuming the models are defined within a Django app models.py file.
# This is a generic template and might require adjustments.

class A(models.Model):
    foo_choices = [("A", "output1"), ("B", "output2")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choices)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class B(A):
    foo_choices = A.foo_choices + [("C", "output3")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choices)
    
    def get_field_foo_display(self):
        for choice in self.foo_choices:
            if choice[0] == self.field_foo:
                return choice[1]
        return super(B, self).get_field_foo_display()
```

### Notes:

- This template assumes the child model `B` extends the choices from the parent model `A` and adds its own.
- The `get_field_foo_display()` method in `B` attempts to find a display value in the extended choices before defaulting to the parent method.
- You will need to adjust class names, field names, and file paths according to your project's specific details.

This approach provides a conceptual solution based on the information available. For a precise solution, you would need to adapt this template to fit the exact structure and requirements of your Django project.
