Given the nature of our interaction, I don't have direct access to the actual codebase or the specific details of the implementation that would allow me to write a precise patch for the issue described. However, based on the general context around the issue with extra lines being printed in error messages when using `assert` in Python 3.9, I can provide a hypothetical approach to addressing a common cause of such problems in pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism. This approach is speculative and intended as an illustrative example.

### Hypothetical Patch for Assertion Rewriting Issue

The issue might be related to how pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism handles source code introspection in Python 3.9, possibly due to changes in the Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) handling or line number reporting in newer Python versions. A common place to start looking would be in the assertion rewriting logic, which enhances the information provided in assertion failure reports.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>
def _rewrite_assert(msg, source):
    # Example original code snippet that might be causing the issue
    line_no = _get_line_no(source)
    return f"assert {msg}, {{'line_no': {line_no}}}"
</original>
<patched>
def _rewrite_assert(msg, source):
    # Adjusted code snippet to handle potential changes in Python 3.9's AST or line number reporting
    line_no = _get_line_no(source)
    # Ensure that line_no is correctly determined in Python 3.9
    if sys.version_info >= (3, 9):
        line_no = _adjust_line_no_for_python_39(line_no, source)
    return f"assert {msg}, {{'line_no': {line_no}}}"

def _adjust_line_no_for_python_39(line_no, source):
    # Hypothetical function to adjust line numbers in Python 3.9
    # This function would contain logic specific to handling changes in Python 3.9 that affect line number reporting
    # For illustrative purposes only
    return line_no - 1  # Example adjustment, actual logic would depend on the specific issue encountered
</patched>
```

### Note
This modification is purely illustrative and based on a hypothetical scenario where the issue is related to line number reporting in Python 3.9's assertion rewriting mechanism. In reality, addressing the issue would require a thorough understanding of the specific changes in Python 3.9 that affect the behavior, detailed analysis of the actual code causing the problem, and potentially adjustments in multiple places within pytest's codebase.

To implement a real fix, one would need to:
1. Identify the exact cause of the issue by reviewing the Python 3.9 changelog, pytest's assertion rewriting logic, and how decorators are handled.
2. Write unit tests that reproduce the issue in Python 3.9.
3. Apply the necessary modifications to the codebase.
4. Verify the fix by running the unit tests in both Python 3.9 and earlier versions to ensure compatibility.

Please consider this response as a starting point for thinking about how to approach the problem, rather than a direct solution to apply.
