Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to provide a direct patch to the codebase or access specific implementation details. My responses are based on hypothetical scenarios and general programming knowledge, aiming to guide or suggest approaches that might be taken in a real-world scenario.

However, addressing the issue of providing a patch without direct access to the specific problematic code or the ability to verify the issue within the context of Python 3.9 and pytest, here's a generalized approach to what such a patch might conceptually involve, based on common practices for addressing compatibility issues and error reporting discrepancies in software development:

### Conceptual Patch for Compatibility Issue with Python 3.9 in pytest

Please note, the following is a conceptual example and not a direct patch due to the limitations mentioned above.

```python
# This is a conceptual example and not directly applicable
<file>conceptual/pytest/compatibility_fix.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet that might be causing compatibility issues with Python 3.9
# Due to the abstract nature of this response, specific original code cannot be provided.
</original>
<patched>
# Conceptual patched code to address compatibility with Python 3.9
# Example adjustment to handle Python 3.9 specific changes in error reporting or AST handling
if sys.version_info >= (3, 9):
    # Adjustments or additional handling specific to Python 3.9
    # This could involve modifying how assertions are rewritten or how error messages are constructed
    pass
else:
    # Existing behavior for versions prior to Python 3.9
    pass
</patched>
```

### Explanation

- **File Path**: The `<file>` tag is used to indicate the location of the file within the pytest codebase that might require modification. Since we're working with a hypothetical scenario, `conceptual/pytest/compatibility_fix.py` is a placeholder path.

- **Original Code**: The `<original>` tag would normally contain the specific code snippet causing the issue. In this conceptual example, it's acknowledged that a direct snippet cannot be provided due to the lack of access to the actual codebase and the issue details.

- **Patched Code**: The `<patched>` section outlines a conceptual approach to adding version-specific handling for Python 3.9. This approach checks the Python version at runtime and applies adjustments or additional handling if Python 3.9 or later is detected. The actual adjustments would depend on the specific nature of the compatibility issue encountered, such as changes in the Python AST used by pytest for assertion rewriting or differences in error reporting mechanisms.

This conceptual example is intended to illustrate the type of modifications that might be considered when addressing compatibility issues arising from updates in Python versions. Actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the issue, access to the specific code causing the problem, and testing across the affected Python versions to ensure the patch resolves the issue without introducing regressions.
