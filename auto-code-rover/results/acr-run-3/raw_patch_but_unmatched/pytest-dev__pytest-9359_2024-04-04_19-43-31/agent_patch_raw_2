Given the constraints of our interaction and without access to the actual source code or specific details about the implementation of pytest or the nature of the changes in Python 3.9 that could be causing the issue, it's not possible to provide a precise patch that directly addresses the problem described. My ability to generate meaningful code modifications is limited to hypothetical scenarios based on common patterns and practices in debugging and patching software issues, particularly those related to version compatibility and error reporting mechanisms.

However, I can offer a general strategy that might be employed when facing such issues, focusing on the principles of identifying and resolving compatibility issues between different Python versions in a testing framework like pytest:

1. **Review Python's Changelog**: Start by reviewing the changelog for Python 3.9 to identify any changes to the assertion mechanism, the abstract syntax tree (AST), or error handling that could affect pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism.

2. **Enhance Logging for Debugging**: Temporarily enhance logging or debugging output in the areas of pytest that handle assertion rewriting and error reporting to capture more detailed information about how assertions are being processed and where the additional lines in the error output are coming from.

3. **Isolate the Issue**: Create minimal test cases that isolate the behavior observed in Python 3.9, comparing the output with that of Python 3.7 to pinpoint exactly where the extra lines are being introduced.

4. **Engage with the Community**: Since this issue could potentially affect many users, engaging with the pytest and Python communities (e.g., via mailing lists, GitHub issues) might provide additional insights or reveal if others have encountered and addressed similar issues.

5. **Consult pytest's Documentation and Source Code**: Delve into pytest's documentation and source code, particularly the modules responsible for assertion rewriting (`_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`) and error reporting, to understand the mechanisms in place and how they might interact differently with Python 3.9.

Without the ability to directly apply a patch or access the specific sections of code causing the issue, these steps represent a strategic approach to diagnosing and potentially resolving compatibility issues arising from version updates in Python.
