Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it appears a direct patch or precise code modification cannot be provided without specific matches to the original program's code. The guidance offered was intended to conceptualize a solution based on common practices for resolving SQL ambiguity within Django's ORM framework, especially in complex query scenarios involving "GROUP BY" clauses.

Since a direct application of edits to resolve the issue as described is not feasible without exact code snippets or a clearer understanding of the original program's structure, I recommend the following steps to address the ambiguity error in Django's "GROUP BY" clause:

1. **Review Django ORM Documentation**: Specifically, look into sections covering annotations, aggregations, and Subquery expressions to ensure their correct usage and see if there are updated practices in Django 3.0.4 that might affect their behavior.

2. **Consult Django Community Forums or Stack Overflow**: Often, issues like these have been encountered and solved by others in the community. Searching for the error message or describing the issue in these forums might yield solutions or workarounds that have worked for similar scenarios.

3. **Debugging and Manual SQL Review**: Temporarily converting the problematic Django ORM query to its raw SQL equivalent can help identify exactly where the ambiguity arises. Django's `queryset.query` attribute can be printed to see the raw SQL query. From there, manually reviewing the SQL might provide insights into how to adjust the ORM query to avoid ambiguity.

4. **Incremental Query Building**: Start with a simplified version of the query that does not produce the error, then incrementally add complexity (e.g., additional annotations, filters, or subqueries) until the error reappears. This process can help isolate the specific part of the query causing the issue.

Without the ability to directly modify or interact with the original program, these general steps are recommended to approach and potentially resolve the described issue. Each step involves iterative review and adjustment based on the specific behaviors of Django's ORM and the details of your project's models and queries.
