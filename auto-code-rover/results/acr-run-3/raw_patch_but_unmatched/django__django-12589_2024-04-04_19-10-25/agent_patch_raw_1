Given the issue described involves a "GROUP BY" clauses error in Django 3.0.4 related to a complex query involving models `A`, `B`, `AB`, and `C`, and considering the ambiguity of the "status" column reference, a hypothetical patch could involve explicitly specifying the table name in the `GROUP BY` clause to resolve the ambiguity. However, without direct access to the specific query construction or the models' implementation details, the following patch is speculative and aims to address the described problem based on standard Django ORM practices and the information provided.

Since the original and patched code snippets are not directly available from the issue description, the patch will be conceptual and should be adapted to fit the actual codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>models.py</file>
<original>
class AB(models.Model):
    a = models.ForeignKey(A, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="ab_a")
    b = models.ForeignKey(B, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="ab_b")
    status = models.IntegerField()
</original>
<patched>
class AB(models.Model):
    a = models.ForeignKey(A, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="ab_a")
    b = models.ForeignKey(B, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="ab_b")
    status = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        # Assuming 'ab' is the table name for model AB
        ordering = ['ab__status']  # Specify default ordering to potentially mitigate GROUP BY ambiguity
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>views.py or wherever the query is constructed</file>
<original>
ab_query = AB.objects.filter(a=OuterRef("pk"), b=1)
filter_conditions = Q(pk=1) | Q(ab_a__b=1)
query = A.objects.\
filter(filter_conditions).\
annotate(
    status=Subquery(ab_query.values("status")),
    c_count=Count("c"),
).values("status").annotate(total_count=Count("status"))
</original>
<patched>
ab_query = AB.objects.filter(a=OuterRef("pk"), b=1)
filter_conditions = Q(pk=1) | Q(ab_a__b=1)
query = A.objects.\
filter(filter_conditions).\
annotate(
    status=Subquery(ab_query.values("status").order_by('status')),  # Ensure subquery is ordered to prevent ambiguity
    c_count=Count("c"),
).values("status").annotate(total_count=Count("status")).order_by('status')  # Explicitly order by 'status' to prevent ambiguity
</patched>
```

Please note, the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific details of your models and the structure of your Django project. The modifications aim to address the ambiguity in the "GROUP BY" clause by ensuring that any reference to "status" is clearly associated with an order, either through default model ordering or by explicitly ordering subqueries and annotations.
