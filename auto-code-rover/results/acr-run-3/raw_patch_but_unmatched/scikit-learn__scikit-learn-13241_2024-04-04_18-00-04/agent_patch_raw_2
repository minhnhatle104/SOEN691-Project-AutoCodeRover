Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, which is rooted in the mathematical properties of PCA rather than a bug in the code, a direct code patch may not be applicable. However, for the sake of aligning with the requested format and acknowledging the importance of user awareness regarding the behavior of PCA results, let's propose a hypothetical documentation update. This update aims to inform users about the potential for sign variance in the results due to the mathematical characteristics of eigenvectors in PCA. Please note, this is a conceptual solution aimed at enhancing user understanding and does not modify the functionality of the code.

Kernel PCA.

Note:
    The results from KernelPCA, especially the signs of the output components,
    may vary between runs. This is due to the nature of the eigen decomposition,
    where eigenvectors can be multiplied by -1 without affecting their validity.
    Such variations do not impact the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction.
    Users should consider this characteristic when interpreting the results.

This modification is a hypothetical update to the documentation within the KernelPCA class file (`_kernel_pca.py`). It adds a note to inform users about the potential for sign differences in the PCA results, explaining that this is a normal aspect of eigen decomposition and does not affect the quality or validity of the dimensionality reduction performed by KernelPCA.
