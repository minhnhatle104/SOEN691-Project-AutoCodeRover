Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, it's clear that providing a direct patch without access to the specific implementation details or error messages from the Django codebase is challenging. My previous attempts were speculative and aimed to illustrate potential approaches rather than exact solutions.

Creating a precise and applicable patch requires detailed information about the codebase and the specific segments causing the issue, which was not available. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a valid patch under these conditions. 

For addressing issues in a live codebase, especially one as complex as Django's, direct access to the code, the ability to run tests, and detailed error reports are crucial. These enable developers to identify the root cause of the issue accurately and verify that the proposed changes resolve the issue without introducing new problems. 

I recommend consulting the Django project's contribution guidelines, issue tracker, and possibly reaching out to the community for support in creating a patch for this issue.
