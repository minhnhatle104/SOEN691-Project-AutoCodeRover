This patch refactors the `get` method in the `AutocompleteJsonView` class to use a new method, `serialize_results`, for constructing the list of result dictionaries. It also introduces a `serialize_result` method that handles the serialization of a single object. This change allows for easier customization of the autocomplete response by overriding `serialize_result` to include additional fields, as demonstrated in the issue description.
