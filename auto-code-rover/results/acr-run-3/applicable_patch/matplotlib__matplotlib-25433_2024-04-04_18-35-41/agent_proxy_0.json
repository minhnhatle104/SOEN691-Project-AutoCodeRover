Additionally, understanding how `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` functions interact with these widgets is crucial. Given this, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. Search for the `RangeSlider` class to understand its structure and how it handles the `on_changed` callback.\n2. Search for the `Button` class to understand its structure and how it handles the `on_clicked` callback.\n3. Search for the `clf` method in the entire codebase to understand how it clears the figure and its implications on widgets.\n4. Search for the `draw` method in the entire codebase to understand how it redraws the figure and its implications on widgets.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_class(\"RangeSlider\")`\n- `search_class(\"Button\")`\n- `search_method(\"clf\")`\n- `search_method(\"draw\")`"
