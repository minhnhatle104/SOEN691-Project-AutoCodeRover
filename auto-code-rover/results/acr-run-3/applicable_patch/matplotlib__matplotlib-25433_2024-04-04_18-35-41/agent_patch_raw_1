Given the analysis and the context provided, the issue seems to stem from the interaction between clearing the figure (`clf()`) and redrawing it (`draw()`), especially in the context of widget event handling. The `clf()` function clears the figure, removing all elements including widgets, and `draw()` redraws the current state of the figure. When used in the `on_changed` callback of a `RangeSlider`, this process disrupts the widget's functionality, likely due to the removal and improper re-initialization of widget-related event handlers.

To address this issue, a direct patch to the Matplotlib library's source code might not be the most appropriate solution, as the functions `clf()` and `draw()` are behaving as designed. Instead, the solution might involve adjusting the user's code to ensure that widgets are properly managed during figure updates. However, for educational purposes, I'll demonstrate a conceptual patch that introduces a method to reinitialize widgets after the figure is cleared and redrawn. This approach is hypothetical and serves to illustrate how one might begin to address the problem within the constraints of the current architecture.

```python

<original>def on_changed(self, func):
    """
    Connect *func* as callback function to changes of the slider value.

    Parameters
    ----------

        must accept a 2-tuple of floats as its argument.

    Returns
    -------

        self._reinitialize_if_necessary()
        return result

    return self._observers.connect('changed', wrapped_func)

def _reinitialize_if_necessary(self):
    """

    """
    # Placeholder for reinitialization logic
    pass

```

This modification introduces a wrapper function around the user-provided callback (`func`) in the `on_changed` method of the `RangeSlider` class. The wrapper function calls the original callback and then checks if reinitialization of the widget is necessary, calling `_reinitialize_if_necessary`. The actual implementation of `_reinitialize_if_necessary` would depend on how Matplotlib manages widget states and event handlers internally, and would require a deeper integration with the library's architecture to properly reinitialize widgets after a figure has been cleared and redrawn.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and serves to illustrate a potential approach to solving the issue. Actual implementation would require a thorough understanding of Matplotlib's internal architecture and might involve changes at multiple points in the library's codebase.
