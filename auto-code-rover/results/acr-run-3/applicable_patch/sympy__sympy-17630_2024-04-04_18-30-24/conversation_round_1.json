        "content": "Based on the collected context from the `BlockMatrix` class and its `_blockmul` method, we can start to understand the structure and functionality relevant to the issue at hand. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n### BlockMatrix Class\n- **Location**: `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - `shape`: The overall shape of the `BlockMatrix`.\n  - `blockshape`: The shape in terms of the number of blocks along rows and columns.\n  - `blocks`: The actual blocks within the matrix.\n  - `rowblocksizes`, `colblocksizes`: Sizes of blocks along rows and columns, respectively.\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `_blockmul(self, other)`: Method for block multiplication. It checks if the other matrix is a `BlockMatrix` and if the column block sizes of the first matrix match the row block sizes of the second matrix. If so, it multiplies the blocks; otherwise, it falls back to regular multiplication.\n\n### _blockmul Method\n- **Behavior**: The method performs a check to ensure that it's multiplying with another `BlockMatrix` with matching block sizes. If the conditions are met, it attempts to multiply the blocks directly. Otherwise, it defaults to standard multiplication.\n\n### Issue Analysis\nThe issue arises when performing block multiplication multiple times with matrices containing `ZeroMatrix` blocks. After the first multiplication, `ZeroMatrix` blocks seem to be replaced or interpreted as `Zero` objects, which lack the `cols` attribute, leading to an `AttributeError`.\n\nGiven this context, the problem likely lies in how the multiplication results are processed or how `ZeroMatrix` blocks are handled during the multiplication. The conversion of `ZeroMatrix` to `Zero` might not be handled correctly, or there might be a missing check to properly handle `Zero` objects in subsequent operations.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo further diagnose and fix the issue, we might need to:\n- Investigate how the multiplication results are combined and simplified, specifically looking at how `ZeroMatrix` and `Zero` objects are treated.\n- Review the code that handles the multiplication results to ensure `ZeroMatrix` blocks maintain their matrix properties.\n- Consider adding checks or conversions for `Zero` objects in block operations to prevent attribute errors.\n\nGiven the current context, a deeper dive into the multiplication process and how results are handled could provide the necessary insights to develop a patch."
