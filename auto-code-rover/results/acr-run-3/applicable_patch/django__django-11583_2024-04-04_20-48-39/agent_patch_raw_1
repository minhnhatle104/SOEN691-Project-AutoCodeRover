Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential patch would involve adding a check to ensure that paths containing null bytes are not processed by the `watched_files` method in `django/utils/autoreload.py`. This could prevent the `ValueError: embedded null byte` from being raised when `Pathlib`'s `resolve` method is called on such paths. Since the exact location and handling of the `resolve` method call are not directly shown in the provided code snippets, the patch will focus on sanitizing the input in the `watched_files` method.

```

This modification adds a check to filter out any files from `self.extra_files` and files matched by `directory.glob(pattern)` that contain null bytes (`'\x00'`) in their paths. This approach aims to prevent problematic paths from being processed further down the line, specifically avoiding issues when such paths are resolved using `Pathlib`'s `resolve` method. 

Note: This patch assumes that the presence of null bytes in file paths is the root cause of the `ValueError: embedded null byte` and that such paths are not valid for the application's purposes. If there are legitimate use cases for paths containing null bytes in this context, a different approach may be needed.
