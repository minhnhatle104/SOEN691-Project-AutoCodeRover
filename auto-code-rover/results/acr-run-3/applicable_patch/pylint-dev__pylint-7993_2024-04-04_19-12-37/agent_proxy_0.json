            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how Pylint processes the `--msg-template` argument and how it has changed between the versions mentioned. The error message originates from `pylint/reporters/text.py`, and it specifically mentions not recognizing the argument in the `--msg-template`. This suggests that the handling of message templates, particularly those with custom braces, has changed or is not working as expected in the newer version of Pylint.\n\nGiven this information, we should look into the relevant parts of the Pylint codebase that are responsible for processing the `--msg-template` argument and generating the output based on it. This will likely involve the text reporter and possibly the configuration handling code.\n\nLet's start by examining the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n1. Search for the method that generates the warning about not recognizing the argument in the `--msg-template`. This is likely where the issue arises.\n2. Search for the class or method that handles the `--msg-template` argument to understand how message templates are processed.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"warnings.warn(\", \"pylint/reporters/text.py\")\nsearch_method(\"handle_msg_template\")\n```"
