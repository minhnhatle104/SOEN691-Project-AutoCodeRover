        "content": "<issue>Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\nclear_cache()\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\n# This works fine\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\nclear_cache()\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\n```\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n</issue>"
