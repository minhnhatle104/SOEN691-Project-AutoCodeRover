These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that transformers with 0 features are correctly handled when the output is set to "pandas". The first modification allows the process to continue for transformers with 0 features under specific conditions, ensuring they are included in the transformation process. The second modification ensures that feature names are correctly generated and prefixed, even for transformers with 0 features, by introducing a placeholder name for such cases. This approach maintains compatibility with pandas output and prevents the `ValueError` related to mismatched lengths in feature names.
