This modification ensures that `stream_decode_response_unicode` always has a valid encoding to work with, defaulting to 'utf-8' if none is provided. It also adds a check to ensure that if, for any reason, a chunk is already a string (which should not normally happen in the context of `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True`), it is encoded back to bytes using the response's encoding before attempting to decode it. This is a safeguard to ensure the function's robustness and might help in scenarios where the response's content is manipulated or inspected before streaming.
