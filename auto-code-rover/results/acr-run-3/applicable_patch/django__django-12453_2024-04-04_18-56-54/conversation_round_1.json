I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\nfrom django.utils.six import StringIO\nfrom django.utils.six.moves import input\n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\nthe serialize_db_to_string method.\n\"\"\"\ndata = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\ndef _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\ndef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n# ...\nwith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\nself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered significant context around the issue and the proposed fix. Let's break down the findings:\n\n1. **BaseDatabaseCreation Class**: This class is responsible for database creation and setup for testing purposes in Django. It includes methods for creating test databases, serializing and deserializing database contents, and more. The methods `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string` are part of this class, as indicated in the issue description.\n\n2. **serialize_db_to_string Method**: This method serializes all data in the database into a JSON string. It's designed for test runner usage and handles the serialization of database models based on their dependencies, ensuring that models are serialized in an order that respects their relationships. However, as noted in the issue, it does not account for foreign key constraints directly, which can lead to issues when deserializing.\n\n3. **deserialize_db_from_string Method**: This method deserializes data from a string (generated by `serialize_db_to_string`) and saves the objects to the database. The current implementation does not wrap the deserialization and saving process in a transaction, which can lead to integrity errors if an object with a foreign key is saved before the referenced object.\n\n4. **atomic Function**: The `atomic` function is a decorator/context manager for wrapping database operations in a transaction. It ensures that all operations within the block either complete successfully together or are all rolled back in case of an error. This function is proposed to be used in the `deserialize_db_from_string` method to wrap the deserialization and saving of objects in a transaction.\n\n**Analysis**:\nThe issue arises because the `deserialize_db_from_string` method does not use transactions when saving objects, leading to potential integrity errors if the order of object creation does not respect foreign key constraints. The proposed fix is to wrap the deserialization and saving process in a transaction using Django's `atomic` function. This approach is consistent with how Django's `loaddata` command handles data loading, which wraps the entire process in a transaction to avoid similar issues.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the issue, the proposed fix seems appropriate. It leverages Django's existing transaction management to ensure that all objects are either saved successfully together or not at all, preventing integrity errors due to ordering issues. This fix should be carefully tested, especially in scenarios with complex model relationships and potential circular dependencies, to ensure it does not introduce any new issues."
