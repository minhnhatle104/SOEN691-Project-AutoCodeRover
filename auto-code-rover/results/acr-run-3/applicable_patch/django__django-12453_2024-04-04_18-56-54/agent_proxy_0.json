Understanding its current behavior and how it interacts with transactions will be key to proposing a correct fix.\n\n4. `search_method(\"atomic\")`: Given that the proposed solution involves wrapping database operations in a transaction using `transaction.atomic`, it would be useful to understand how `atomic` is used elsewhere in the project to ensure consistency and correctness in the proposed solution."
