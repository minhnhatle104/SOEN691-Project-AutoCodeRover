This was not the case in previous versions.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\na = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)\nb = np.sin(a)\nc = np.cos(a)\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,2),constrained_layout=False)\nax[0].plot(a,b)\nax[1].plot(a,c)\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)\n```\n### Actual outcome\nThe plot works fine but the warning is generated\n`/var/folders/ss/pfgdfm2x7_s4cyw2v0b_t7q80000gn/T/ipykernel_76923/4170965423.py:7: UserWarning: This figure was using a layout engine that is incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; not calling subplots_adjust.\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)`\n### Expected outcome\nno warning\n### Additional information\nWarning disappears when constrained_layout=False is removed\n### Operating system\nOS/X\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.6.0\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\nconda\n</issue>"
