This modification addresses the issue by adding a check for the case where there is only one polynomial equation but more than one generator (variable), which indicates an underdetermined system that should raise a `NotImplementedError`. It also ensures that the generic solving path (`solve_generic`) is only taken when the number of equations matches the number of generators, thus handling the case more explicitly and preventing misleading results for underdetermined systems.
