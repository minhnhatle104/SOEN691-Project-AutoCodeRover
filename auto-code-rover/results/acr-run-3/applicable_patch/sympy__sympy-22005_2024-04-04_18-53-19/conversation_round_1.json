        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into the issue and the proposed patch for the SymPy library. Here's a summary of the key components involved:\n\n### `solve_poly_system` Function\n- Located in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`.\n- Solves a system of polynomial equations.\n- Accepts a sequence of equations (`seq`) and generators (`gens`) among other arguments.\n- The function processes the equations and attempts to solve them using different strategies based on the properties of the system (e.g., biquadratic systems).\n\n### `_solve_reduced_system` Method\n- The search did not find this method in the provided context, which suggests that the patch might be introducing changes to an internal method not directly exposed or the method's name or location has changed. This discrepancy needs further investigation or clarification.\n\n### `Poly` Class\n- Located in `sympy/polys/polytools.py`.\n- Represents a polynomial in SymPy.\n- Contains methods for polynomial manipulation, including operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and evaluation.\n- The class plays a crucial role in polynomial equation solving as it is used to represent the equations within the `solve_poly_system` function.\n\n### Issue and Patch Analysis\nThe issue reported involves the incorrect handling of cases where the system of equations should result in an infinite number of solutions but doesn't. Specifically, the problem occurs when solving a system with a single equation in more than one variable, such as `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`, which should raise a `NotImplementedError` due to the system being underdetermined but instead returns a misleading result.\n\nThe proposed patch modifies the condition in an unspecified method (presumably within the process of solving polynomial systems) to ensure that a `NotImplementedError` is raised when the system is not zero-dimensional (i.e., when it does not have a finite number of solutions). The condition checks that there is exactly one univariate equation and also that the number of generators is exactly one, which aligns with the requirement for the system to have a finite number of solutions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe issue highlights a specific edge case in the handling of polynomial systems in SymPy, where the system's dimensionality is not correctly accounted for, leading to incorrect or misleading results. The proposed patch aims to correct this by tightening the conditions under which the solver attempts to find solutions, ensuring that errors are raised for underdetermined systems.\n\nGiven the discrepancy in finding the `_solve_reduced_system` method, it would be necessary to either consult the latest codebase directly or clarify the method's current implementation and location within the project. This would ensure that the patch is applied correctly and that the underlying logic aligns with the project's architecture and design principles."
