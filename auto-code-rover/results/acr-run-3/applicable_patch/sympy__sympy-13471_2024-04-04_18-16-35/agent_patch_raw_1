<original>                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)</original>
<patched>                num[1] = int(num[1], 16)</patched>
```

This patch corrects the issue of converting a hexadecimal string to an integer in the context of loading a pickled object from Python 2 in Python 3. The original code uses `long`, which is not available in Python 3, and fails when encountering hexadecimal strings that end with 'L', which was a valid representation for long integers in Python 2. The patched version uses `int`, which is the correct way to perform this conversion in Python 3, and it naturally handles hexadecimal strings without the 'L' suffix.
