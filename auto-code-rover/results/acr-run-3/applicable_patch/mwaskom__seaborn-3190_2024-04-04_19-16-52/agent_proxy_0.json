            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the color mapping is handled within the seaborn library, specifically within the `Plot` and `Plotter` classes, as well as the `ContinuousBase` class where the error occurs. The error traceback indicates that the issue arises when attempting to subtract boolean values, which is not supported in numpy. This operation occurs in the `_setup` method of a class that seems to be related to continuous scales, likely during the process of setting up scales for the plot.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls will be necessary to gather more context and understand the code structure related to the issue:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Plot\")`: To get an overview of the `Plot` class and its relationship with the `Plotter` class and other components involved in plotting.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_setup_scales\", \"Plotter\")`: To understand how scales are set up for plotting, which is where the issue seems to originate.\n3. `search_class(\"ContinuousBase\")`: To understand the implementation of continuous scales, specifically looking into the `_setup` method where the error occurs.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"_setup\", \"ContinuousBase\")`: To get the details of the `_setup` method implementation in the `ContinuousBase` class, which is directly involved in the error.\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive understanding of the components involved in the issue and how they interact with each other, which is crucial for devising an effective patch."
