Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem might be related to how the `apart` function handles expressions, particularly when substituting symbols with values before applying the `apart` operation. The unexpected behavior could stem from how the expression is simplified or decomposed, especially considering the assumptions on the symbols (e.g., real, negative). However, without a clear indication of a specific bug in the provided code snippets and based on the nature of the issue described, a precise patch cannot be directly inferred.

Nevertheless, I can propose a general direction for a patch that might address issues related to expression handling in the `apart` function. This hypothetical patch would ensure that the function checks for any simplification opportunities after substitutions are made but before the partial fraction decomposition is attempted. This is speculative and intended as an illustrative example, given the absence of a clear bug in the provided code snippets.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/polys/partfrac.py</file>
<original>
if f.is_Atom:
    return f
else:
    P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()
</original>
<patched>
if f.is_Atom:
    return f
else:
    # Simplify the expression before decomposing it into numerator and denominator
    f = f.simplify()
    P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a call to `simplify()` on the expression `f` before it is decomposed into its numerator and denominator. The `simplify` method attempts to simplify the expression into a more canonical or simpler form, which might help in cases where the expression's structure affects the outcome of the `apart` function.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on a general understanding of symbolic computation. Actual implementation might require a deeper analysis to identify the root cause of the issue and to ensure that the patch does not introduce unintended side effects. Testing with a variety of expressions, especially those similar to the one mentioned in the issue, would be essential before integrating such a change into the codebase.
