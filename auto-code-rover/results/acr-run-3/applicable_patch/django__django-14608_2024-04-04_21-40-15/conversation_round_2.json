This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some information and also face some challenges in addressing the issue:\n\n1. **ErrorList Class**: We found the `ErrorList` class in `django/forms/utils.py`. This class seems to be a central component in handling error lists, with methods for various representations (`as_data`, `as_json`, `as_ul`, `as_text`, etc.). However, the search results do not directly reveal how the `nonfield` CSS class is applied to errors. This suggests that the application of CSS classes might not be directly handled within the `ErrorList` class itself or is done in a way that wasn't captured by the search for \"nonfield CSS class\".\n\n2. **FormSet Class**: The search did not find a class named `FormSet`. This could mean several things:\n   - The class might exist under a different name or within a module that wasn't directly searched.\n   - The functionality related to FormSets might be spread across multiple classes or modules, making it less straightforward to pinpoint a single `FormSet` class.\n   - There might have been a typo or misunderstanding in the search query or the class name.\n\n3. **add_error Method in FormSet**: Since the `FormSet` class was not found, it follows that searching for the `add_error` method within it also yielded no results. This method was expected to be a potential place to implement or extend functionality for adding the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors.\n\n4. **Search for \"nonfield CSS class\"**: The search did not find any code related to the \"nonfield CSS class\". This might indicate that the way CSS classes are applied to errors is not straightforward or is handled in a more dynamic manner than simply adding a class name in the code.\n\nGiven these results, our next steps need to be adjusted:\n\n- Since the `FormSet` class was not found directly, it might be useful to search for files or modules that are likely to deal with form sets or similar functionalities. This could involve searching for keywords related to form sets or looking into files that deal with form handling in general.\n- The lack of results for the \"nonfield CSS class\" suggests we might need to look into how Django (assuming this is a Django project based on the file path) handles CSS classes for errors more broadly. This could involve looking into documentation or source code related to form rendering and error handling.\n- It might also be beneficial to revisit the `ErrorList` class with a more focused search, possibly looking into how instances of this class are used or modified in the context of forms and form sets.\n\nBefore proceeding with further searches or attempting to patch the issue, it's crucial to gather more context and ensure a thorough understanding of the existing error handling and CSS class application mechanisms within the project."

        "content": "The additional search results provide significant context that can help us understand the structure and behavior of formsets in Django, as well as how error classes are handled across the framework. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the new information:\n\n1. **BaseFormSet in formsets.py**: We've confirmed that `BaseFormSet` is defined in `django/forms/formsets.py`, which is a central piece in handling collections of form instances. This class likely serves as the foundation for any custom or derived formset classes, making it a crucial point for implementing the `nonform` CSS class functionality.\n\n2. **Classes in formsets.py**: The search within `django/forms/formsets.py` revealed several methods and class definitions. Notably, methods like `__init__`, `_construct_form`, `cleaned_data`, `ordered_forms`, and `full_clean` could be involved in formset validation and error handling. The presence of multiple class definitions outside of functions suggests that there are several components within this file that could be relevant to our issue.\n\n3. **Usage of error_class**: The term `error_class` appears across various files in the Django codebase, including `forms/utils.py`, `forms/forms.py`, and `forms/formsets.py`. This widespread usage indicates that `error_class` is a key part of how Django handles error styling and classification. The references in `forms/formsets.py` are particularly relevant to our issue, as they suggest that formsets already have some mechanism for handling error classes, which might be extendable to include `nonform` errors.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the key insights and next steps:\n\n- **Bug Locations**: The `BaseFormSet` class within `django/forms/formsets.py` is likely where modifications are needed to implement the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors. Specifically, methods involved in error handling and formset validation (`full_clean`, `_construct_form`, etc.) are potential points where the `nonform` CSS class logic could be integrated.\n\n- **Error Class Handling**: The widespread use of `error_class` in the codebase, and specifically its presence in `forms/formsets.py`, suggests that there is an existing framework for handling error styling that we can leverage. We need to review how `error_class` is used within `BaseFormSet` and related components to understand how to best introduce the `nonform` CSS class.\n\n- **Next Steps**: A detailed review of `BaseFormSet` and its methods in `django/forms/formsets.py` is necessary to identify exactly where and how to implement the `nonform` CSS class. Additionally, examining the usage of `error_class` within this file will provide insights into the current mechanism for error styling, which can guide the implementation of the new feature.\n\nGiven these insights, the next step would involve drafting a patch that introduces the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors in formsets, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the existing error handling and styling mechanisms in Django."
