Since the direct search for `Axis.set_ticks` and `Axes.set_xticks` did not yield results, and considering the possibility of a misunderstanding in the method names or their locations, I will adjust the strategy to focus on broader terms that are likely to be related to the issue at hand.\n\nTo proceed, I will construct search API calls that aim to find broader and more general aspects of the project that are likely related to the issue, such as classes or methods dealing with axes and ticks in a plotting context. This approach is speculative but may help in identifying the correct context or related code snippets that could lead us to the specific methods mentioned in the issue.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Axis\")\nsearch_class(\"Axes\")\nsearch_method(\"set_ticks\")\nsearch_method(\"set_xticks\")\n```\n\nThese searches are designed to find any classes named `Axis` or `Axes` and any methods that might be related to setting ticks, which could provide clues about the correct method names or their locations in the codebase."
