<original>    def set_ticks(self, ticks, labels=None, *, minor=False, **kwargs):
        """
        Set this Axis' tick locations and optionally labels.

        If necessary, the view limits of the Axis are expanded so that all
        given ticks are visible.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ticks : list of floats
            List of tick locations.  The axis `.Locator` is replaced by a
            `~.ticker.FixedLocator`.

            Some tick formatters will not label arbitrary tick positions;
            e.g. log formatters only label decade ticks by default. In
            such a case you can set a formatter explicitly on the axis
            using `.Axis.set_major_formatter` or provide formatted
            *labels* yourself.
        labels : list of str, optional
            List of tick labels. If not set, the labels are generated with
            the axis tick `.Formatter`.
        minor : bool, default: False
            If ``False``, set the major ticks; if ``True``, the minor ticks.
        **kwargs
            `.Text` properties for the labels. These take effect only if you
            pass *labels*. In other cases, please use `~.Axes.tick_params`.

        Notes
        -----
        The mandatory expansion of the view limits is an intentional design
        choice to prevent the surprise of a non-visible tick. If you need
        other limits, you should set the limits explicitly after setting the
        ticks.
