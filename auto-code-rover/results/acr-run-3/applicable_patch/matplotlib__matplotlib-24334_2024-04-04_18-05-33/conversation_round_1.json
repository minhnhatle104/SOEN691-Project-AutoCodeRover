In other cases, please use `~.Axes.tick_params`.\n```\nThis means that in e.g. `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=[\"a\", \"b\"])`, the incorrect `xticklabels` silently do nothing; they are not even validated (because `labels` has not been passed).\n### Proposed solution\nWe should at least check that `kwargs` are valid Text properties in all cases; we could even consider making any kwargs an error if `labels` is not set.\n</issue>"

It's common for method names to be slightly misspelled or misremembered.\n\n2. **Indirect Method Invocation**: The methods might be indirectly invoked or aliased under different names within the codebase. This is a common practice to maintain backward compatibility or to provide more intuitive naming for API users.\n\n3. **External Dependency**: These methods could be part of an external library or dependency that the project relies on, rather than being directly defined within the project's codebase. For example, if this issue is related to a plotting library like Matplotlib, the methods might be defined in the Matplotlib codebase rather than in the user's project.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the next steps to further investigate the issue could involve:\n\n- **Reviewing the Issue Description for Clues**: Re-examine the issue description to see if there are any alternative names or additional context that could help locate the relevant code.\n\n- **Checking External Dependencies**: If the project relies on external libraries for plotting or graphical representation (like Matplotlib), reviewing the documentation or source code of those libraries might provide insights into how `set_ticks` and `set_xticks` are implemented or should be used.\n\n- **Consulting Project Documentation**: Sometimes, projects have their own wrappers or utility functions that abstract away direct calls to methods like `set_ticks`. Consulting the project's documentation or searching the codebase for related terms could uncover these abstractions.\n\nWithout direct access to the codebase or the ability to perform additional searches, these are speculative next steps. However, they align with common troubleshooting practices when dealing with missing references in a software project."
