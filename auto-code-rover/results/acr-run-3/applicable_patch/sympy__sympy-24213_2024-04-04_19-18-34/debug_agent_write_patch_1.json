        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within the `UnitSystem` class of the SymPy library, specifically when handling expressions involving addition (`Add`). The traceback you provided indicates that the method fails to properly handle cases where dimensions in an addition operation are equivalent but not identically represented, leading to a `ValueError`.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, we can see that the method is designed to traverse through an expression and collect both the scale factor and the dimension of each component of the expression. The method handles various types of expressions, including `Quantity`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, and `Function`. \n\nThe issue arises in the `elif isinstance(expr, Add):` block, where the method iterates over the arguments of an addition operation. It checks if the dimensions of all addends are the same as the first addend. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. This approach assumes that equivalent dimensions will always be represented in the same way, which might not be the case, leading to the observed issue.\n\nTo address this issue, a potential solution would involve enhancing the dimension comparison logic to recognize equivalent dimensions, even if they are represented differently. This could be achieved by utilizing the dimension system's capabilities to simplify and compare dimensions more robustly, rather than relying on a direct equality check.\n\nA patch would likely involve modifying the `elif isinstance(expr, Add):` block to improve how dimensions are compared. This could include using a method from the dimension system to check for equivalence rather than direct equality, or simplifying dimensions before comparison.\n\nBefore proceeding with a patch, it's essential to ensure that any changes made do not adversely affect other parts of the library that rely on the current behavior of `_collect_factor_and_dimension`. Additionally, thorough testing with various expressions involving units and dimensions would be necessary to validate the patch."

Instead of directly comparing dimensions using `!=`, the patch uses the `equivalent_dims` method from the dimension system to check if two dimensions are equivalent, even if they are not identically represented. This approach allows the method to correctly handle cases where dimensions are equivalent but represented differently, thus resolving the issue described. Note that for this solution to work as intended, it's assumed that the `get_dimension_system()` method provides access to a dimension system that has an `equivalent_dims` method capable of comparing the equivalence of two dimensions. If such a method does not exist, it would need to be implemented in the dimension system class."
