Explanation:
The patch modifies the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class to address the issue with handling equivalent dimensions in addition operations. Instead of directly comparing dimensions using `!=`, the patch uses the `equivalent_dims` method from the dimension system to check if two dimensions are equivalent, even if they are not identically represented. This approach allows the method to correctly handle cases where dimensions are equivalent but represented differently, thus resolving the issue described. Note that for this solution to work as intended, it's assumed that the `get_dimension_system()` method provides access to a dimension system that has an `equivalent_dims` method capable of comparing the equivalence of two dimensions. If such a method does not exist, it would need to be implemented in the dimension system class.
