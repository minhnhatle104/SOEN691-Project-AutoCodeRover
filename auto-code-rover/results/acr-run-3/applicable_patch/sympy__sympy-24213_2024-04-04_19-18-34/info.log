The traceback you provided indicates that the method fails to properly handle cases where dimensions in an addition operation are equivalent but not identically represented, leading to a `ValueError`.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, we can see that the method is designed to traverse through an expression and collect both the scale factor and the dimension of each component of the expression. The method handles various types of expressions, including `Quantity`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, and `Function`. \n\nThe issue arises in the `elif isinstance(expr, Add):` block, where the method iterates over the arguments of an addition operation.

Instead of directly comparing dimensions using `!=`, the patch uses the `equivalent_dims` method from the dimension system to check if two dimensions are equivalent, even if they are not identically represented. This approach allows the method to correctly handle cases where dimensions are equivalent but represented differently, thus resolving the issue described. Note that for this solution to work as intended, it\'s assumed that the `get_dimension_system()` method provides access to a dimension system that has an `equivalent_dims` method capable of comparing the equivalence of two dimensions. If such a method does not exist, it would need to be implemented in the dimension system class.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
