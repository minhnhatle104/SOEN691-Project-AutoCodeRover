Specifically, we want to see how these components currently handle settings cleansing, especially for iterables other than dictionaries. This will help us identify the gap in handling other iterable types like lists, which seem to be the core of the problem.\n\nLet's start by locating these components in the codebase:\n\n1. Search for the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class to understand its structure and find the `get_safe_settings` method within it.\n2. Search for the `cleanse_setting` method in the entire codebase, as it's not clear from the issue description where this method is defined.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"SafeExceptionReporterFilter\")\nsearch_method(\"cleanse_setting\")\n```"
