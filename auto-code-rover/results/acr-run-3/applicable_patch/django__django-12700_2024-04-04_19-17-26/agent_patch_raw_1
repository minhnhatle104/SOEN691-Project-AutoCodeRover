```

This modification enhances the `cleanse_setting` method to handle iterables such as lists and tuples, in addition to dictionaries. It checks if the value is an instance of `list` or `tuple` and then applies the cleansing process to each item in the iterable, preserving the original type (list or tuple). This ensures that settings containing sensitive information nested within lists or tuples are properly cleansed.
