```

This modification attempts to add a `kind` property to the `Derivative` class. The property checks if the expression being differentiated (`self.expr`) is an instance of `MatrixExpr`. If so, it returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` to correctly indicate the kind of matrix expressions. For other types of expressions, it falls back to the superclass implementation of `kind`. This approach ensures that the `kind` property behaves correctly for both matrix expressions and other types of expressions, addressing the issue with the `Derivative` class not properly handling the `kind` attribute for matrix symbols.
