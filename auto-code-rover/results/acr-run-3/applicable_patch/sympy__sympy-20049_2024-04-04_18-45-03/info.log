Instead, velocities must be explicitly set for each point and reference frame combination.\n\nThe expected behavior, as described in the issue, is for the `Point.vel()` method to be able to calculate the velocity of a point in a given reference frame based on its position's time derivative if it hasn't been explicitly set. This behavior would parallel how angular velocities are handled between reference frames.\n\nTo address this issue, we might consider implementing a mechanism within the `Point` class that:\n1. Checks if the velocity of the point in the specified reference frame has been explicitly set.\n2. If not, attempts to calculate the velocity based on the time derivative of the point's position relative to another point, if such a position has been defined.\n\nThis approach would require modifications to the `Point` class to:\n- Allow for the calculation of velocities based on position derivatives.\n- Ensure that this calculation is consistent with the framework's overall design and does not introduce unintended side effects.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve designing and implementing these modifications in the `Point` class, ensuring compatibility with existing functionalities, and adding tests to validate the new behavior.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
