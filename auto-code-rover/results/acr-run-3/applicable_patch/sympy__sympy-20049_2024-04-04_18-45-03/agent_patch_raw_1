This patch attempts to calculate the velocity of a `Point` in a given `ReferenceFrame` if it has not been explicitly set. It does so by iterating over the positions (`_pos_dict`) relative to other points and calculating the time derivative (`dt`) of these position vectors in the specified frame. If a valid velocity vector can be calculated, it is set and returned. If no velocity can be calculated, the original error is raised. This approach mirrors the logic used for angular velocities in `ReferenceFrame` but applies it to linear velocities of points.
