Specifically, we need to look into the `BoundaryNorm` class and the `format_cursor_data` method, as these are directly mentioned in the stack trace provided in the bug report. Additionally, understanding how `BoundaryNorm` is used within the `format_cursor_data` method could provide insights into why the error occurs and how it might be resolved.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BoundaryNorm\")`: This will help us understand the implementation details of the `BoundaryNorm` class, including its methods and how it's supposed to work. Since the error message mentions that `BoundaryNorm` is not invertible, understanding its design will be crucial.\n\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"format_cursor_data\", \"/Users/jklymak/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/artist.py\")`: This will provide us with the implementation details of the `format_cursor_data` method within the specific file where the bug was encountered. It's important to see how this method interacts with the `BoundaryNorm` instance and why it attempts to call an `inverse` method on it.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"inverse\", \"BoundaryNorm\")`: Since the error specifically mentions a call to the `inverse` method of `BoundaryNorm` that fails, understanding the implementation or the intended behavior of this method will be key to resolving the issue.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the bug, allowing us to devise a strategy for fixing it."

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search API calls, we have a clearer picture of the components involved in the issue:\n\n1. **BoundaryNorm Class**: Located in `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`, the `BoundaryNorm` class is designed to normalize data into the [0, 1] interval using a given set of boundaries. It has a few methods, including `__init__`, `__call__`, and `inverse`. The `inverse` method is particularly relevant to the issue, as it is explicitly designed to raise a `ValueError` stating that \"BoundaryNorm is not invertible\". This behavior is by design, indicating that attempting to invert a `BoundaryNorm` instance is an unsupported operation.\n\n2. **inverse Method in BoundaryNorm**: The `inverse` method's implementation confirms that it is intentionally not invertible, as it raises a `ValueError` whenever called. This method's design choice is crucial to understanding the bug, as it suggests that the crash occurs when something (in this case, likely the `format_cursor_data` method) attempts to invert a `BoundaryNorm` instance, which is not supported.\n\n3. **format_cursor_data Method**: Unfortunately, the search for the `format_cursor_data` method in the specified file path (`/Users/jklymak/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/artist.py`) did not yield results, likely due to an incorrect path or file name in the bug report. However, based on the error stack trace provided in the issue, we know that this method attempts to use the `inverse` function of a `BoundaryNorm` instance, leading to the crash.\n\nGiven this context, the bug arises because the `format_cursor_data` method expects a norm to be invertible, which is not the case for `BoundaryNorm`. The error handling for this specific scenario seems to be missing or inadequate, leading to an unhandled exception and a crash when hovering over an image normalized with `BoundaryNorm`.\n\nTo address this issue, a few potential solutions could be considered:\n- Modify the `format_cursor_data` method to check if the norm is a `BoundaryNorm` instance and handle it accordingly, possibly by avoiding the call to `inverse` or providing a meaningful fallback behavior.\n- Implement an approximate inverse for `BoundaryNorm` if it makes sense from a mathematical and practical standpoint, though this might be complex and not always feasible.\n- Improve error handling in the `format_cursor_data` method to catch the `ValueError` raised by `BoundaryNorm.inverse` and handle it gracefully, preventing the crash and possibly providing useful feedback to the user.\n\nThe next step would involve modifying the `format_cursor_data` method to implement one of these solutions. However, without direct access to the `format_cursor_data` method's implementation details, we would need to make assumptions or seek additional information about its behavior and how it interacts with norm instances."
