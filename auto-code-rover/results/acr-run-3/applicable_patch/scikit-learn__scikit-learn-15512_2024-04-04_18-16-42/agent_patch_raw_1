This modification explicitly handles the case when the algorithm reaches the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter - 1`, considering zero-based indexing) without converging. It ensures that a warning is issued, and the `labels` and `cluster_centers_indices` are set to indicate non-convergence, as expected by the user. This change aims to make the behavior more predictable and in line with the documentation, improving the usability of the `affinity_propagation` function in scenarios where convergence is not achieved.
