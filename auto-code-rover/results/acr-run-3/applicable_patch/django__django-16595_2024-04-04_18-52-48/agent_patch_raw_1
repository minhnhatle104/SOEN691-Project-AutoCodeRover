This patch introduces logic to handle consecutive `AlterField` operations on the same field by combining their attributes into a single `AlterField` operation. The implementation assumes the use of `CharField` for simplicity, but the actual implementation should dynamically determine the field class based on the operations being combined. This approach aims to optimize migration operations by reducing redundant alterations to the same field.
