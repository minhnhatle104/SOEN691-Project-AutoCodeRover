This patch addresses the issue by checking if `n_SV` (the number of support vectors) is zero before proceeding with the calculation that leads to the division by zero error. If `n_SV` is zero, it sets `self.dual_coef_` to an empty sparse matrix, avoiding the division by zero. Otherwise, it proceeds as before. This approach ensures that the code can gracefully handle cases where there are no support vectors without crashing.
