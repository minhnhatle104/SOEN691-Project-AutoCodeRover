Given the context and the issue with Django's `StatReloader` not tracking changes in `manage.py`, a potential patch would involve ensuring that `manage.py` is explicitly included in the set of files to be monitored by the autoreload mechanism. Since the provided code snippets do not show how `self.watched_files()` is populated, we'll assume that the issue might be related to `manage.py` not being considered by the autoreload system. A straightforward approach to patch this issue would be to modify the `snapshot_files` method to explicitly include `manage.py` if it's not already being watched.

However, without direct visibility into how `self.watched_files()` is implemented or populated, this patch will make a hypothetical adjustment to ensure `manage.py` is included in the list of files to watch. This approach might need to be adjusted based on the actual implementation details of `self.watched_files()`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/utils/autoreload.py</file>
<original>def snapshot_files(self):
    # watched_files may produce duplicate paths if globs overlap.
    seen_files = set()
    for file in self.watched_files():
        if file in seen_files:
            continue
        try:
            mtime = file.stat().st_mtime
        except OSError:
            # This is thrown when the file does not exist.
            continue
        seen_files.add(file)
        yield file, mtime</original>
<patched>import os
def snapshot_files(self):
    # Ensure manage.py is explicitly included in the watched files
    manage_py_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'manage.py')
    # watched_files may produce duplicate paths if globs overlap.
    seen_files = set([manage_py_path])  # Pre-populate seen_files with manage.py path
    for file in self.watched_files():
        if file in seen_files:
            continue
        try:
            mtime = file.stat().st_mtime
        except OSError:
            # This is thrown when the file does not exist.
            continue
        seen_files.add(file)
        yield file, mtime
    # Explicitly check and yield manage.py if not already done
    if manage_py_path not in seen_files:
        try:
            mtime = os.stat(manage_py_path).st_mtime
            yield manage_py_path, mtime
        except OSError:
            pass</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the path to `manage.py` can be relatively determined from the location of the `autoreload.py` file, which might not always be accurate depending on the project structure. It explicitly adds `manage.py` to the set of files to monitor for changes. If `manage.py` is located elsewhere in the project or if the project structure does not conform to this assumption, the path calculation for `manage_py_path` would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on the assumption that the issue is due to `manage.py` not being monitored by the autoreload mechanism. Further investigation and testing would be required to ensure this patch addresses the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
