My responses are based on the details available from the initial issue description and the results of the search API calls provided. \n\nTo address the issue within the constraints of this scenario, the recommended approach involves modifying the `BoundWidget.id_for_label` method within the `django/forms/boundfield.py` file, as previously discussed. This method should be updated to respect custom `id` attributes, aligning with the expectations for widget rendering in Django forms.\n\nFor further action or more precise identification of buggy locations, direct access to the project's codebase and the ability to perform additional searches or reviews would be necessary."
