Based on the context retrieved and the analysis of the issue, here is a proposed patch to address the problem where `BoundWidget.id_for_label` ignores the `id` set by `ChoiceWidget.options`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/boundfield.py</file>
<original>    def id_for_label(self):
        return 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])</original>
<patched>    def id_for_label(self):
        # Use the custom 'id' attribute if it's set in the widget's attributes.
        if 'id' in self.data['attrs']:
            return self.data['attrs']['id']
        else:
            return 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])</patched>
```

This modification checks if a custom `id` attribute is present in the widget's attributes (`self.data['attrs']`). If it is, the method now returns this custom `id` instead of generating a new one based on the widget's name and index. This change ensures that the `id_for_label` method respects the `id` set through `ChoiceWidget.options` or similar mechanisms, aligning with the expected behavior described in the issue.
