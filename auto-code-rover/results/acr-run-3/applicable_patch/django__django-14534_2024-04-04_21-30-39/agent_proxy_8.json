My responses have been based on the provided search results and the analysis of those results. \n\nFor addressing the issue as described, the identified location within the `django/forms/boundfield.py` file, specifically the `BoundWidget.id_for_label` method, has been pinpointed based on the information available. This method's adaptation to respect custom `id` attributes set through `ChoiceWidget.options` or similar mechanisms is the recommended approach to resolving the reported issue.\n\nFurther precision in identifying buggy locations or additional context would require direct interaction with the project's codebase, which is beyond the scope of my current capabilities."
