        "content": "Based on the results from the search API calls, let's analyze the context and information we've gathered to understand the issue and how we might approach fixing it.\n\n1. **Classes `ProxyCustomModel` and `AnotherModel` were not found in the codebase.** This indicates that these models are specific to the user's project and not part of Django's internal code. Therefore, the issue likely lies in how Django's ORM handles proxy models in conjunction with `select_related()` and `only()` methods, rather than in the user-defined models themselves.\n\n2. **`select_related` method in `QuerySet` class:** This method is designed to perform SQL joins and include related objects in the query result. It's clear from the method's documentation and implementation that it's intended to work with ForeignKey fields to optimize database queries by reducing the number of separate queries needed.\n\n3. **`only` method in `QuerySet` class:** This method is essentially the opposite of `defer()`, loading only the specified fields immediately when the queryset is evaluated. The method's implementation ensures that it cannot be used in conjunction with `.values()` or `.values_list()`, and it throws an error if `None` is passed as an argument.\n\n4. **Code snippet `opts = cur_model._meta`:** This snippet is found within the `deferred_to_data` function in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and it's involved in handling deferred loading of fields. The issue description suggests that changing this line to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` resolves the crash. This change seems to be aimed at ensuring that the operations consider the concrete model's metadata rather than the proxy model's metadata, which might not have direct database fields mapped in the same way.\n\nGiven this analysis, the root cause of the issue appears to be related to how Django's ORM handles deferred loading (`only()`) and eager loading (`select_related()`) in the context of proxy models. The suggested fix modifies the handling of model metadata to ensure that the concrete model's metadata is used, which likely aligns the field handling more closely with the database's actual structure and relationships.\n\nTo proceed with a patch, we would need to carefully consider the implications of this change on other parts of Django's ORM, especially regarding backward compatibility and potential side effects on other ORM features. A comprehensive test suite covering various use cases of `select_related()`, `only()`, and proxy models would be essential to validate the patch before proposing it for inclusion in Django."
