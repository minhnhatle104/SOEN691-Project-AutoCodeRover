Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem lies not in the code itself but in how Sphinx's autodoc extension resolves type annotations, particularly with `struct.Struct`. Since there's no direct "buggy" code to patch in the traditional sense, the solution might involve clarifying the documentation or providing explicit directives to Sphinx. However, without a specific bug in the code to fix and without access to the Sphinx configuration (`conf.py`), we can propose a hypothetical patch that could help Sphinx distinguish between the custom `Struct` class and `struct.Struct`.

This patch would involve adding a module-level docstring or comment to `sphinx/testing/util.py`, explicitly stating that the `Struct` class is not meant to replace or represent `struct.Struct` from the Python standard library. This is more of a documentation clarification rather than a code patch.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/testing/util.py</file>
<original>class Struct:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)
</original>
<patched>"""
Note: This `Struct` class is a utility for testing purposes within Sphinx and is not related to `struct.Struct` from the Python standard library.
"""

class Struct:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)
</patched>
```

Additionally, for resolving the Sphinx autodoc issue, one might consider adding explicit type hints or references in the Sphinx documentation to ensure `struct.Struct` is correctly identified. This could be done in the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) or directly in the docstrings, but without access to those files or specific Sphinx directives, it's challenging to provide a precise patch.

In summary, the issue seems to stem from a documentation generation problem rather than a bug in the codebase. The proposed modification aims to clarify the purpose of the custom `Struct` class to avoid confusion, but resolving the Sphinx autodoc issue might require adjustments to the Sphinx configuration or documentation practices.
