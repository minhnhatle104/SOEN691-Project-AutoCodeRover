Understanding its implementation and any special handling of `struct.Struct` will be crucial.\n\n4. `search_code(\"import struct\")` - This will give us an overview of how and where `struct` is being imported and used across the project, which might reveal patterns or practices that could contribute to the issue.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how `struct.Struct` is used within the project and any potential areas that might be causing the Sphinx documentation generation issue."
