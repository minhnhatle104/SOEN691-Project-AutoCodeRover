Additionally, understanding the context of the `test` function that triggers the error could provide insights into the problem. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SomeClass\")`: This will help us understand where `SomeClass` is defined and how it's structured beyond the minimal example provided in the issue.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__getattribute__\", \"SomeClass\")`: This will give us more context on the custom `__getattribute__` method implementation within `SomeClass`.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"SomeClass\")`: This will provide details on the custom `__repr__` method implementation within `SomeClass`, which seems to be part of the issue as its raising an exception is leading to an INTERNALERROR.\n\n4. `search_method(\"test\")`: Since the issue occurs when the `test` function is executed, understanding all occurrences and definitions of `test` functions across the project could provide clues on how `SomeClass` instances are being tested and potentially mishandled."
