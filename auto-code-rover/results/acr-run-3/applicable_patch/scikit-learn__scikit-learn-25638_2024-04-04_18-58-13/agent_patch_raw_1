        "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r" % y

# Additional check for pandas nullable types to ensure they are handled correctly
if hasattr(y, "dtype") and str(y.dtype) in ["Int64", "Float64", "boolean"]:
    y = y.to_numpy(dtype=str(y.dtype).lower())  # Convert to numpy with correct dtype</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue with handling nullable pandas dtypes in the `type_of_target` function. The first modification ensures that nullable pandas dtypes are recognized and classified correctly instead of being marked as 'unknown'. The second modification ensures that when a pandas series with a nullable dtype is encountered, it is converted to a numpy array with the corresponding non-nullable dtype, allowing for correct processing downstream.
