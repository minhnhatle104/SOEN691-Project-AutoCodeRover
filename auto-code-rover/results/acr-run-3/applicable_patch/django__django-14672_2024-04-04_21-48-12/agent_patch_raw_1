<patched>    from django.utils.hashable import make_hashable
    def identity(self):
        return super().identity + (
            self.through,
            make_hashable(self.through_fields),
            self.db_constraint,
        )</patched>
```

This patch modifies the `identity` method in the `ManyToManyRel` class to ensure `through_fields` is made hashable before being included in the identity tuple. It imports the `make_hashable` function from `django.utils.hashable` and applies it to `through_fields`. This change addresses the issue where `through_fields`, being a list, caused a `TypeError` when the `identity` method attempted to hash it.
