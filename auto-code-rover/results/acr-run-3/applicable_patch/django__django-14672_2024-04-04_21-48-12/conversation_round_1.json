        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered significant context about the issue, the `ManyToManyRel` class, the `make_hashable` method, and the usage of `through_fields` in the codebase. Let's break down the findings and plan our next steps for addressing the issue.\n\n### ManyToManyRel Class\n- **Location**: `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`\n- **Details**: The `ManyToManyRel` class is defined here with an `__init__` method that accepts `through_fields` among other parameters. However, there's no mention of `make_hashable` being used within this class based on the provided snippet. This is the class we need to modify to ensure `through_fields` is made hashable.\n\n### make_hashable Method\n- **Location**: `django/utils/hashable.py`\n- **Details**: This method attempts to make a given value hashable. It handles dictionaries by converting them into sorted tuples and iterables by mapping `make_hashable` recursively. For values that are already hashable, it simply returns the value. This method will be crucial for making `through_fields` hashable.\n\n### through_fields Usage\n- **Occurrences**: Found in multiple files, notably in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, among others.\n- **Details**: The `through_fields` attribute is used in various parts of the codebase, including model definitions and migrations. Its usage in `ManyToManyRel` is of particular interest to us.\n\n### Analysis and Next Steps\n1. **Modify ManyToManyRel**: We need to ensure that `through_fields` is processed by `make_hashable` within the `ManyToManyRel` class. This likely involves modifying the `identity` property or another relevant part of the class where `through_fields` contributes to the object's identity.\n\n2. **Ensure Compatibility**: Given the widespread use of `through_fields` in the codebase, any changes made to its handling in `ManyToManyRel` must not adversely affect its usage elsewhere. This includes ensuring that making it hashable does not break any existing functionality or expectations in other parts of Django.\n\n3. **Testing**: It's crucial to add tests that specifically cover the case described in the issue\u2014using `through_fields` with a list in a proxy model scenario. This will help ensure that the patch not only fixes the current issue but also prevents regressions in the future.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to draft a patch for the `ManyToManyRel` class that incorporates `make_hashable` for `through_fields` and to prepare tests that validate this change."
