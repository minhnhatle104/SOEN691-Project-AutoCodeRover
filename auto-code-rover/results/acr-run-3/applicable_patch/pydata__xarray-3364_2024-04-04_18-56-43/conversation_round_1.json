Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n</issue>"

Given that the issue specifically mentions difficulties with concatenating `xray Datasets` and seeks a more user-friendly approach akin to `pd.concat`, it's likely that the relevant implementation or enhancement would be in `xarray/core/concat.py`, as this file name suggests a direct involvement with dataset concatenation functionalities.\n\nThe mention of `xray.concat` needing an option to handle datasets with different variables more gracefully suggests that we should look into the implementation within `xarray/core/concat.py` to understand how variables are currently handled during concatenation. The goal would be to identify where and how the method could be modified or enhanced to include an option for ignoring missing variables, filling them with `NaN` (or another specified value), without requiring the user to manually adjust datasets before concatenation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve a deeper dive into the `concat` method within `xarray/core/concat.py` to understand its current behavior, parameters, and how it handles variables across different datasets. This would provide the necessary context to propose a patch or enhancement that addresses the issue."
