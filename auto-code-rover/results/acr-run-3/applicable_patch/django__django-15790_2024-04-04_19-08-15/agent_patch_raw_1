This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the error is only raised if there are genuinely multiple different paths for the same library name, rather than simply multiple entries for the same path. It does this by converting the list of items (module paths) to a set, `unique_items`, which automatically removes duplicates. The check for duplicates (`if len(items) > 1:`) is then replaced with a check against the length of `unique_items`. This way, if the same path is mistakenly added more than once for a library name, it won't incorrectly trigger the error.
