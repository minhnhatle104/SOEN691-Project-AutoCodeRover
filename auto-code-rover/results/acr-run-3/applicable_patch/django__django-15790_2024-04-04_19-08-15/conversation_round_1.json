The error message suggests there might be a problem with identifying or differentiating between template tag libraries when they have the same name but are located in different modules.\n\nGiven this, we should look into the implementation of the check that raises the error `(templates.E003)`. This involves finding the method or function responsible for this check. Since the error code is quite specific, it's likely part of a validation or checks system related to templates.\n\nLet's start by searching for the method or code that might be responsible for this check. We can look for methods related to template validation or specifically for checking template tag names.\n\n1. `search_method(\"check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name\")`: This will help us find the method that performs the check mentioned in the issue description.\n2. `search_code(\"TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']\")`: Since the issue mentions adding a template tag library into `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']`, searching for this code snippet might reveal where and how these libraries are processed or registered, which could be related to the issue.\n\nThese searches aim to provide a better understanding of how the project handles template tag libraries and performs checks for duplicate names."

        "content": "The collected context from the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` method in `django/core/checks/templates.py` provides valuable insights into how the project checks for template tags with the same name and how it handles the `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']` configuration.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components of the method and their implications:\n\n1. **Libraries Collection**: The method starts by creating a `defaultdict` for libraries, intended to map library names to their module paths. This structure is used to keep track of all the custom template tag libraries defined across the project.\n\n2. **Custom Libraries Extraction**: It iterates over the `TEMPLATES` configuration, specifically looking into the `OPTIONS` dictionary for each template configuration to find any custom `libraries` defined. Each found library (identified by a module name and its path) is added to the `libraries` defaultdict. This step directly relates to the issue, as it involves processing the `libraries` configuration where the problem is reported to occur.\n\n3. **Template Tag Modules Gathering**: The method also gathers template tag modules from another source (`get_template_tag_modules()`), which likely includes default or globally available template tag libraries, and adds them to the `libraries` mapping as well.\n\n4. **Error Detection**: Finally, the method checks for duplicate library names by iterating over the `libraries` mapping. If a library name maps to more than one module path (indicating the same name is used for multiple template tag modules), it records an error using a predefined error message template (`E003.msg`), which includes the library name and the conflicting module paths.\n\n5. **Error Reporting**: The method returns a list of errors, which can then be used by the system to inform the user or developer about the detected configuration issues.\n\nGiven this context, the issue reported seems to stem from the way the system collects and checks template tag libraries. Specifically, the error arises when the same library name is associated with multiple module paths, which the system currently flags as a configuration error. However, the issue description suggests that this might be an incorrect or overly strict interpretation, especially if the same library name is intentionally used in different contexts or applications within the project.\n\nTo address the issue, potential solutions could involve modifying the check to allow for certain exceptions or to more intelligently handle cases where the same library name is used in different parts of the project. This could involve additional configuration options or more sophisticated logic to differentiate between genuinely conflicting configurations and valid use cases of the same library name."
