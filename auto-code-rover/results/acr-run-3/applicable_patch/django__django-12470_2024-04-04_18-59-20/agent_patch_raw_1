Given the issue description and the context retrieved from the Django codebase, the core of the problem seems to be related to how ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is not being correctly applied or inherited by the child model, particularly when the ordering is specified as "-pk" for descending order based on the primary key.

However, based on the code snippets provided from `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/query.py`, there isn't an immediately obvious bug in the implementation of `_check_ordering` or `order_by` that would cause the described issue. Both methods appear to be handling their respective responsibilities correctly: `_check_ordering` validates the ordering specified in the `Meta` class, and `order_by` modifies the queryset's ordering.

Without a clear bug in the provided snippets and without additional context or error messages, proposing a specific patch is challenging. The issue might stem from a more complex interaction within Django's ORM system, possibly involving how model inheritance is handled at a deeper level or how the `Meta` ordering is inherited and applied to queries for child models.

Given these constraints, a hypothetical patch might involve ensuring that the child model correctly inherits and applies the `Meta` ordering from the parent model. However, without a specific bug to address in the provided code, any patch would be speculative. It's also worth noting that modifying Django's core behavior could have wide-ranging implications, so any changes should be thoroughly tested.

For educational purposes, here's a hypothetical approach to ensure that the child model inherits the `Meta` ordering from the parent model, assuming there was a mechanism to explicitly check and apply inherited ordering:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/base.py</file>
<original>
if cls._meta.order_with_respect_to or not cls._meta.ordering:
    return []
</original>
<patched>
# Hypothetical patch to ensure child models inherit 'ordering' from parent's Meta
if cls._meta.order_with_respect_to:
    return []
if not cls._meta.ordering and hasattr(cls, '_meta.parent'):
    cls._meta.ordering = cls._meta.parent.ordering
elif not cls._meta.ordering:
    return []
</patched>
```

This modification is purely illustrative and based on a hypothetical scenario where child models have a reference to their parent's `_meta` to directly inherit the `ordering` if not specified in the child. In reality, Django's model inheritance and `Meta` options handling are more complex, and such changes would require in-depth understanding and testing within Django's ORM framework.

For actual resolution, further investigation into how Django handles `Meta` options inheritance in model inheritance scenarios would be necessary, along with a detailed understanding of the specific circumstances under which the issue occurs.
