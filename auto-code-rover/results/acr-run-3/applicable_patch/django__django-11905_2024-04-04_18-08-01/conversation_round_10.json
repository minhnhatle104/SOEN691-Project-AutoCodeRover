The usage here is hardcoded to a boolean value (`True`), which is consistent with the expected behavior. However, this doesn't directly address the issue but gives us insight into how `__isnull` is utilized in query construction.\n\nThe broader search results indicating 230 snippets containing `__isnull` across various files, including tests and admin filters, suggest that `__isnull` is a widely used lookup across the Django ORM and related components. The primary concern raised in the issue is the undocumented and untested use of non-boolean values with `__isnull`, which could lead to inconsistent behavior or confusion.\n\nGiven this context, the approach to solving the issue should involve:\n\n1. **Validating `__isnull` Lookup Values:** Implementing a validation step to ensure that only boolean values are passed to `__isnull` lookups. This might not be directly related to the `split_exclude` function but could be a more global validation mechanism within the ORM's lookup processing system.\n\n2. **Updating Documentation and Tests:** Since the issue mentions that using non-boolean values is undocumented and untested, part of the resolution should also include updating the Django documentation to clearly state that `__isnull` only accepts boolean values. Additionally, adding tests to cover scenarios where non-boolean values are passed to `__isnull` could help ensure that the system behaves as expected (i.e., raising an error).\n\nThe specific location identified (`split_exclude` in `query.py`) does not appear to be where the validation needs to be added, as it's already using a boolean value. Instead, the solution likely involves adding validation in the lookup processing mechanism that precedes query construction, which might not have been directly identified in the search results. \n\nTo proceed, we would need to review the ORM's lookup processing system to identify where such a validation step could be logically and effectively integrated. This might involve examining the code paths that lead to methods like `split_exclude` where `__isnull` lookups are ultimately used."
