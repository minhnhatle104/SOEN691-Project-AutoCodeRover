Given the nature of the issue, it's likely part of a query construction or filtering mechanism, possibly within an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or a database interaction layer. The description suggests that `__isnull` is used in a way that might affect the construction of SQL queries, particularly influencing the type of JOIN used.\n\nTo gather more context and find the relevant parts of the codebase to patch, we should look for:\n\n1. The class or method where `__isnull` lookup is parsed or processed.\n2. Any validation mechanism for query parameters that could be extended or modified to enforce the boolean value constraint for `__isnull`.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"__isnull\")`: This will help identify where in the codebase the `__isnull` lookup is being processed or handled.\n2. `search_code(\"isnull\")`: This broader search might catch instances where `__isnull` is mentioned in comments, documentation, or in a context not directly tied to a method name, providing additional insights into its usage and implementation.\n\nThese searches aim to locate the relevant sections of the codebase where modifications are needed to enforce the new constraint on `__isnull` usage."

        "content": "Based on the search results, the `isnull` keyword appears extensively across the Django project, with significant occurrences in files related to database operations, model definitions, and tests. This widespread usage indicates that `isnull` is a fundamental part of Django's ORM for handling nullability in database queries. The issue at hand involves ensuring that `__isnull` lookups only accept boolean values to prevent confusion and maintain consistency in query behavior.\n\nGiven the results, the most relevant files for addressing the issue are likely to be:\n\n1. **django/db/models/lookups.py**: This file likely contains the implementation of the `__isnull` lookup. Modifying the behavior to enforce boolean values should start here.\n2. **django/db/models/sql/query.py**: This file's involvement with query construction suggests it might handle how `__isnull` influences JOIN operations. It could be a place to enforce or check the value passed to `__isnull`.\n3. **tests/queries/tests.py**: With the highest number of matches, this file likely contains extensive test cases around query behavior, including `__isnull` usage. After modifying the `__isnull` behavior, updating or adding tests here will be crucial to ensure the change doesn't introduce regressions and that the new boolean-only constraint is enforced.\n\nTo proceed with addressing the issue, the next steps involve:\n\n1. **Reviewing the implementation in `django/db/models/lookups.py`**: Understanding how `__isnull` is currently processed will guide how to introduce a check for boolean values.\n2. **Identifying where in the query construction process in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` the `__isnull` lookup influences JOIN behavior**: This will help understand the current handling and where to potentially raise an error for non-boolean values.\n3. **Assessing existing tests in `tests/queries/tests.py`**: This will show how `__isnull` is currently tested and where new tests for the boolean-only constraint should be added.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to dive into the specific implementation details within these identified files, starting with `django/db/models/lookups.py` to understand and then modify the `__isnull` lookup processing."
