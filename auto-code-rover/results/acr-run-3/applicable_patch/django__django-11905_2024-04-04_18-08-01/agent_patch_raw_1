To address the issue of enforcing boolean values for `__isnull` lookups, we need to ensure that any usage of `__isnull` within the Django ORM's query construction process explicitly checks the value being passed and raises an error if it is not a boolean. The provided context from `django/db/models/sql/query.py` does not directly show where the value for `__isnull` is validated, but it does show where `__isnull` is used. Given this, the patch will focus on adding a validation step before `__isnull` lookups are processed to ensure they receive boolean values only. Since the exact location for this validation is not provided, I will propose a conceptual patch that could be applied in a method that processes lookups, such as where filters are added or where lookups are resolved.

    condition.add(or_null_condition, OR)

if contains_louter:
    # Ensure the value passed to __isnull is a boolean
    isnull_value = True  # This value is typically determined dynamically
    if not isinstance(isnull_value, bool):
        raise ValueError("__isnull lookup requires a boolean value.")
    or_null_condition, _ = self.build_filter(
        ('%s__isnull' % trimmed_prefix, isnull_value),
        current_negated=True, branch_negated=True, can_reuse=can_reuse)
    condition.add(or_null_condition, OR)
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a conceptual change where before the `__isnull` lookup is processed, there's a check to ensure the value is a boolean. The actual implementation would likely need to be placed in a more appropriate location where the value passed to `__isnull` is determined or right before the lookup is resolved. The example uses a hardcoded `True` value for demonstration purposes, but in practice, this value would be the one passed by the user or the system in the lookup.

Please note, the actual implementation may require identifying the precise location in the Django ORM's codebase where lookup values are validated or where the `__isnull` lookup specifically is handled. This could involve modifications in the lookup resolution process or adding a new validation layer for lookup values.
