Additionally, understanding how `get_response_async` is implemented or supposed to be implemented in the context of Django's ASGI handlers will be crucial. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"StaticFilesHandlerMixin\")`: This will help understand the current implementation of the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` and see if the `get_response_async` method is indeed missing or improperly implemented.\n\n2. `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`: This will provide insight into how the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` is implemented and how it's supposed to work with async responses.\n\n3. `search_method(\"get_response_async\")`: Since the traceback mentions that `get_response_async` is awaited on in `django/core/handlers/asgi.py`, it's important to see where else this method is defined or used across the project to understand its intended behavior and requirements.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue and how they are supposed to interact with each other, which is essential for devising a solution."
