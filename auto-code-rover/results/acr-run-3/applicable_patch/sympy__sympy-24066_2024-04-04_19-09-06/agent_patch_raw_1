                return factor ** exp_factor, dim

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that when the exponent in a `Pow` expression is dimensionless, the dimension of the base is not erroneously modified. Instead, the dimension of the result remains the same as the dimension of the base, which aligns with the expected behavior for expressions like `exp(expr)` where `expr` is dimensionless.
