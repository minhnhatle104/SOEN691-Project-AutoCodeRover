Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified three relevant pieces of code related to the `convert_to` method in the SymPy codebase. Let's analyze each to understand how they might relate to the issue reported:\n\n1. **`sympy/physics/units/util.py` - `convert_to` function:**\n   - This function is designed to convert expressions with units to expressions with target units, whenever the dimensions are compatible. It supports conversion to a single unit/quantity or a collection of units/quantities. The function handles addition and multiplication of units, as well as powers of units. It uses a conversion matrix to determine how to convert the expression to the target units.\n   - This function seems to be the core of the issue reported, as it directly deals with unit conversion, which is where the unexpected behavior (`joule*second` converting to `joule**(7/9)`) was observed.\n\n2. **`sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` - `Quantity` class's `convert_to` method:**\n   - This method allows a `Quantity` object to be converted to another quantity of the same dimensions. It internally calls the `convert_to` function from `util.py`, passing along the `other` parameter (target units) and the `unit_system`.\n   - While this method is related to unit conversion, the issue described does not directly involve the conversion of a `Quantity` object but rather an expression involving units. Therefore, this method might not be directly involved in the bug but is still relevant to the overall functionality of unit conversion.\n\n3. **`sympy/polys/domainmatrix.py` - `DomainMatrix` class's `convert_to` method:**\n   - This method is designed to convert the elements of a `DomainMatrix` from one domain to another. It is unrelated to the physical units conversion and does not seem to be relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary focus should be on the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. The bug likely resides in how this function handles the conversion process, particularly in cases where the conversion involves complex expressions with units that do not directly map to the target units or when the conversion involves operations like multiplication or division of units that result in non-intuitive outcomes.\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to review and possibly revise the logic within the `convert_to` function to ensure it correctly handles cases like the one reported, where `joule*second` should not convert to `joule**(7/9)` but rather should either remain unchanged, convert to an expression in terms of base units, or produce an error if the conversion is not possible or does not make sense."
