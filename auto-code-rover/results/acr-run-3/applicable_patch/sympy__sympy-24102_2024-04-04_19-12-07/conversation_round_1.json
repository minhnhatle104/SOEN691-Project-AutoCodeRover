        "content": "Based on the search results, we have found the implementation of the `parse_mathematica` function within the `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` file. However, there was no class named `mathematica` found in the codebase, which aligns with the issue description indicating that `mathematica` was a function, not a class. The absence of a class named `mathematica` suggests that the old functionality was indeed encapsulated within a function, and there might not be a direct class-based replacement or equivalent that we could compare against directly.\n\nThe `parse_mathematica` function's purpose is to translate a string containing a Wolfram Mathematica expression into a SymPy expression. It supports both standard input form and Mathematica full form, and it attempts to translate Mathematica expressions into equivalent SymPy expressions. If it fails to find a suitable SymPy expression, it outputs the `FullForm` of the Mathematica expression using SymPy `Function` objects as nodes of the syntax tree.\n\nThe function utilizes a `MathematicaParser` object to perform the parsing. This parser object is likely where the actual parsing logic resides, including the handling (or mishandling) of Greek characters like '\u03bb'. The issue with parsing Greek characters could stem from several areas within this parsing process, such as character encoding handling, specific parsing rules that do not account for non-ASCII characters, or limitations in the `MathematicaParser`'s implementation.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n1. Investigating the implementation of the `MathematicaParser` class to understand how it parses input strings and to identify any potential limitations or bugs related to character handling.\n2. Reviewing how the parser is designed to handle different character sets, especially non-ASCII characters like Greek letters.\n3. Considering the possibility of adding or improving character encoding handling within the parser to support a wider range of characters, including Greek letters.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into the `MathematicaParser` class to get a better understanding of its parsing logic and to identify where the issue with Greek character parsing might be occurring."
