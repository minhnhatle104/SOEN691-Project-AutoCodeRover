To address the issue of parsing Greek characters (and possibly others) in `parse_mathematica`, we need to ensure that the `MathematicaParser` class can correctly handle these characters during the parsing process. The issue likely stems from the handling of non-ASCII characters in function names or arguments. Since the provided context does not explicitly show where Greek characters are mishandled, a general approach to ensure better handling of such characters is to update the regular expressions and parsing logic to accommodate them.

Given the complexity of the `MathematicaParser` class and without a specific pinpoint of the failure in handling Greek characters, a hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that the regular expressions used throughout the parsing process are Unicode-aware and that the parser does not inadvertently filter out or misinterpret Greek characters.

            (?:
            \A|(?<=[^a-zA-Z])   # at the top or a non-letter
            )

            (?=\[)              # [ as a character
            ''', re.VERBOSE)

<patched>re.compile(r'''
            (?:
            \A|(?<=[^\w])       # at the top or a non-word character, considering Unicode characters
            )
            [A-Z][\w\d]*        # Function, allowing Unicode characters in function names
            (?=\[)              # [ as a character
            ''', re.VERBOSE | re.UNICODE)

```

# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>_literal = r"[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*"</original>
<patched>_literal = r"[\w][\w\d]*"</patched>
```

These modifications aim to make the regular expressions in the `MathematicaParser` class Unicode-aware (`re.UNICODE` flag) and to broaden the character set considered for function names and literals to include Unicode word characters (`\w`), which would include Greek characters among others. This approach is somewhat speculative, as the exact cause of the issue was not pinpointed in the provided context. Further testing with Greek characters and other non-ASCII inputs would be necessary to validate the effectiveness of these changes.
