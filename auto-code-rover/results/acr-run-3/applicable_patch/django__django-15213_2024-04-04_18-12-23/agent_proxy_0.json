Specifically, we need to understand how `ExpressionWrapper`, `Q`, and possibly the `annotate` method work within the project's codebase. Given the information provided in the issue, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of the `ExpressionWrapper` class, which seems to be central to the issue.\n2. `search_class(\"Q\")`: Since the problem involves the `Q` object, especially with the negation operator `~`, understanding its implementation will be crucial.\n3. `search_method(\"annotate\")`: The `annotate` method is used in the example provided, so getting more context on how it is implemented and interacts with `ExpressionWrapper` and `Q` objects will be helpful."
