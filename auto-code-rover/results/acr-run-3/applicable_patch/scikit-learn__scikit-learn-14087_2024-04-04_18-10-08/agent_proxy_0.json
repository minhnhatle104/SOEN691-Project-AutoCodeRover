Based on the error traceback provided in the issue, it seems the error is happening within the `fit` method of the `LogisticRegressionCV` class. Additionally, the error message mentions an `IndexError` related to array indexing, which occurs during the handling of `coefs_paths` and `best_indices`.\n\nGiven this information, I will perform the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LogisticRegressionCV\")`: This will help in understanding the structure of the `LogisticRegressionCV` class and its methods.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"LogisticRegressionCV\")`: This will provide detailed information about the `fit` method within the `LogisticRegressionCV` class, where the issue seems to occur.\n3. `search_code(\"coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]\")`: Since the error traceback points to this specific line of code, searching for it will help in understanding its usage and context within the codebase."
