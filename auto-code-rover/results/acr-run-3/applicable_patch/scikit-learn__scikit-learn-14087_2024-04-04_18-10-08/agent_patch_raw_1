Explanation:
- The patch addresses the `IndexError` by ensuring that the indexing operations within the list comprehensions do not exceed the dimensions of the `coefs_paths` array. This is achieved by adding conditional checks to ensure that the index `i` is within the bounds of the respective dimensions of `coefs_paths` for both the 'ovr' and other cases.
- For the 'ovr' case, the condition `if i < coefs_paths.shape[0]` ensures that `i` does not exceed the first dimension of `coefs_paths`.
- For the other case, the condition `if i < coefs_paths.shape[1]` ensures that `i` does not exceed the second dimension of `coefs_paths`.
- These changes aim to prevent the `IndexError: too many indices for array` by ensuring that the indexing is always within the bounds of the array's dimensions.
