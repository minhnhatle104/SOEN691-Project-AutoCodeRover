The issue is specifically with the `slugify` function not stripping dashes and underscores from the beginning and end of the generated slug. To gather the necessary context and find the best place to implement the fix, we should:\n\n1. Locate the `slugify` function within the Django codebase to understand its current implementation.\n2. Review any utility functions or classes that `slugify` might depend on, as the solution might involve modifying those as well.\n\nGiven these objectives, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n- `search_method(\"slugify\")`: This will help us find where the `slugify` method is defined in the Django codebase.\n- `search_class(\"text\")`: Since the issue mentions `django.utils.text.slugify`, finding the `text` class or module could provide additional context on how `slugify` is integrated and whether there are related utility functions or methods we need to consider.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point for understanding the problem and formulating a solution."
