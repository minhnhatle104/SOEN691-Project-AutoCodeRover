Given the context and the code provided, the issue seems to stem from how aliases for joins are reused or created, especially in the context of `FilteredRelation` and `select_related`. The problem might be occurring because the logic for reusing aliases does not adequately account for the specifics of `FilteredRelation`, leading to incorrect object associations. However, without a clear understanding of the exact cause from the provided context, proposing a precise patch is challenging. Still, a general direction for a patch could involve ensuring that when `FilteredRelation` is used, the aliasing mechanism correctly identifies and reuses or creates aliases in a way that maintains the correct associations.

Given the complexity of Django's ORM and the potential for unintended side effects, any modifications should be made with caution and thoroughly tested. Below is a hypothetical patch based on an educated guess about the potential cause. This patch is speculative and should be validated:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>if reuse_with_filtered_relation and reuse:
    reuse_aliases = [
        a for a, j in self.alias_map.items() if a in reuse and j.equals(join)
    ]
else:
    reuse_aliases = [
        a
        for a, j in self.alias_map.items()
        if (reuse is None or a in reuse) and j == join
    ]</original>
<patched>if reuse_with_filtered_relation and reuse:
    reuse_aliases = [
        a for a, j in self.alias_map.items() if a in reuse and j.equals(join, with_filtered_relation=True)
    ]
else:
    reuse_aliases = [
        a
        for a, j in self.alias_map.items()
        if (reuse is None or a in reuse) and j.equals(join, with_filtered_relation=False)
    ]</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
<original>if self.alias_map[join.parent_alias].join_type == LOUTER or join.nullable:
    join_type = LOUTER
else:
    join_type = INNER</original>
<patched>if self.alias_map[join.parent_alias].join_type == LOUTER or join.nullable or join.filtered_relation:
    join_type = LOUTER
else:
    join_type = INNER</patched>
```

**Note**: The `equals` method mentioned in the hypothetical patch for modification 1 assumes an enhancement to the `equals` method to support a `with_filtered_relation` parameter, which would need to be implemented to make this patch work. This parameter would help in distinguishing joins that are otherwise identical but differ in their `FilteredRelation` context. The second modification attempts to ensure that joins involving `FilteredRelation` are always treated as left outer joins (`LOUTER`), which might be necessary to preserve the semantics of `FilteredRelation` in certain queries.

These patches are speculative and aim to illustrate a potential direction for resolving the issue based on the provided context. Actual implementation and testing would be necessary to develop a working solution.
