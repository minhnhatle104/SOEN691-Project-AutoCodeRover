To address the issue, we need to ensure that raising an `Http404` within a path converter's `to_python` method results in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`, rather than the generic server error message. This involves modifying the URL resolution process to handle `Http404` exceptions raised during the conversion process more gracefully.

Given the context and the code snippets provided, here's a proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/urls/resolvers.py</file>
<original>                try:
                    sub_match = pattern.resolve(new_path)
                except Resolver404 as e:
                    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
                    if sub_tried is not None:
                        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
                    else:
                        tried.append([pattern])
                else:
</original>
<patched>                try:
                    sub_match = pattern.resolve(new_path)
                except Http404 as e:
                    # When DEBUG is True, raise Http404 to provide a more informative debug response.
                    if settings.DEBUG:
                        raise Http404(str(e)) from e
                except Resolver404 as e:
                    sub_tried = e.args[0].get('tried')
                    if sub_tried is not None:
                        tried.extend([pattern] + t for t in sub_tried)
                    else:
                        tried.append([pattern])
                else:
</patched>
```

This modification explicitly catches `Http404` exceptions raised during the URL resolution process. When `DEBUG` is `True`, it re-raises the `Http404` exception to trigger the debug response mechanism, providing more informative feedback for debugging purposes. Note that this approach assumes the presence of the `settings.DEBUG` flag, which is a standard Django setting.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and aims to address the described issue based on the provided context. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full Django codebase, testing, and adherence to Django's contribution guidelines.
