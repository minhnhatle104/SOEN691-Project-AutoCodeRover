Based on the issue described and the context provided, the discrepancy between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init > 1` seems to stem from how the best parameters are set after the model has been fit multiple times (`n_init` times). The final e-step in `fit_predict` ensures that the labels are consistent with `fit(X).predict(X)`, but it seems that the best parameters (from the best initialization) are not correctly used before this final e-step. Here's a proposed patch to ensure that the best parameters are set and used correctly before the final e-step in `fit_predict`.

                  'or check for degenerate data.'

self._set_parameters(best_params)

<patched># Set the best parameters before the final e-step to ensure consistency
self._set_parameters(best_params)
self.n_iter_ = best_n_iter
self.lower_bound_ = max_lower_bound

_, log_resp = self._e_step(X)

if not self.converged_:
    warnings.warn('Initialization %d did not converge. '
                  'Try different init parameters, '
                  'or increase max_iter, tol '
                  'or check for degenerate data.'
                  % (init + 1), ConvergenceWarning)

return log_resp.argmax(axis=1)</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the best parameters found across all initializations are set using `self._set_parameters(best_params)` before performing the final e-step. This change aims to resolve the inconsistency issue by making sure that the labels predicted by `fit_predict` are based on the best model parameters obtained from the multiple initializations.
