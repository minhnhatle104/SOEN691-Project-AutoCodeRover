Given the feedback, it appears there was a misunderstanding in identifying the exact location within the `BaseFormSet` class where the `empty_form` property is defined or how `form_kwargs` are applied to it. Since the specific implementation details of the `empty_form` property were not directly provided in the search results, the proposed patch was based on a general understanding of how such a feature might be implemented in Django, which might not have matched the actual code structure accurately.

Without direct access to the specific implementation of `empty_form` in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file and without further search results to clarify this, I'm unable to provide a corrected patch that directly matches the original program's structure. 

In a real-world scenario, the next step would involve directly reviewing the source code of the `django/forms/formsets.py` file, specifically looking for the implementation of the `empty_form` property within the `BaseFormSet` class. This would allow for identifying the exact code snippet that needs modification and crafting a patch that accurately addresses the issue.

For the purpose of this simulation, without the ability to conduct further searches or directly review the file contents beyond the provided search results, I recommend reviewing the Django source code directly, focusing on the `empty_form` property of the `BaseFormSet` class, to identify the appropriate location for applying a patch.
