        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `autosummary` extension in Sphinx works, particularly how it decides which members to include in the generated documentation. The issue mentions that imported members are included even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`. This suggests that we should look into how the `autosummary` extension processes this setting and filters members accordingly.\n\nGiven the information, the following API calls would be relevant to gather more context about the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the autosummary extension**: Since the issue is related to the `autosummary` extension, we need to find where it is implemented in the Sphinx codebase. However, without a direct API to search for extensions, we can start by searching for classes or methods that are likely part of this extension. The configuration option `autosummary_imported_members` is a good starting point.\n\n2. **Search for the configuration option handling**: To understand how the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is processed, we need to find where this configuration option is read and used within the Sphinx codebase.\n\n3. **Search for the member filtering logic**: The core of the issue seems to be related to how members are filtered based on the `autosummary_imported_members` setting. Therefore, finding the part of the code that performs this filtering will be crucial.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following search API calls are proposed:\n\n- `search_code(\"autosummary_imported_members\")`: This will help us find where the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is referenced in the codebase, which is likely where it's being processed.\n- `search_method(\"filter_members\")`: Assuming that there is a method responsible for filtering members based on certain criteria (including whether they are imported or not), this search could help us locate the logic that needs to be fixed.\n\nThese searches are designed to locate the relevant parts of the codebase where the issue might be originating from, allowing us to further analyze and propose a patch."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into how the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is handled and how members are filtered in Sphinx's autosummary and autodoc extensions. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n### Handling of `autosummary_imported_members`\n\n1. **Configuration Setup**: The `autosummary_imported_members` configuration option is added in `sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py` within the `setup` function. It's initialized with an empty list and a boolean flag indicating it does not accept changes after the initial setup. This setup is crucial for controlling whether imported members should be included in the autosummary.\n\n2. **Usage in Generating Docs**: In the same file (`sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py`), within the `process_generate_options` function, the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is read from the app's config and passed to the `generate_autosummary_docs` function. This indicates that the setting influences the document generation process, specifically whether imported members are included or not.\n\n### Member Filtering Logic\n\nThe `filter_members` method found in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` under the `Documenter` class provides a comprehensive mechanism for determining which members of a module or class should be included in the documentation. This method considers several factors, including:\n\n- Visibility (private/public)\n- Special methods\n- Documentation presence\n- User overrides via the `autodoc-skip-member` event\n\nHowever, from the provided context, it's not immediately clear how or if the `autosummary_imported_members` setting directly influences the `filter_members` method. The method does a lot of work to decide whether a member should be documented based on its characteristics and user-defined options, but there's no explicit mention of filtering based on whether a member is imported.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the information at hand, it seems that the issue might stem from a disconnect between the `autosummary_imported_members` setting's intended behavior and the actual member filtering logic, possibly within the autosummary extension rather than autodoc's `filter_members` method. The `autosummary_imported_members` setting is correctly set up and passed to the document generation process, but how it's used to filter out imported members isn't clear from the provided context.\n\nTo address the issue, the next steps could involve:\n\n1. **Further Investigation**: Examining the `generate_autosummary_docs` function and any related logic that directly handles the `autosummary_imported_members` setting to see how it influences which members are included in the generated documentation.\n\n2. **Patch Development**: Once the exact location and cause of the issue are identified, developing a patch would involve ensuring that the `autosummary_imported_members` setting effectively filters out imported members from the documentation, as expected by users.\n\nThis analysis points towards a need for a deeper dive into the autosummary document generation process to pinpoint where the filtering based on imported members should occur and to ensure it aligns with the user's configuration."
