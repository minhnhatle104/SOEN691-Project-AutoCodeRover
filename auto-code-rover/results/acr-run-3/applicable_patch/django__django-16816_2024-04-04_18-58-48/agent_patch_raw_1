Based on the context and the issue described, it seems the problem arises from an attempt to display a field (`choice`) in the Django admin interface that does not directly exist on the `Question` model but rather on the `Choice` model. Since the initial issue mentioned using `list_display = ["choice"]` in `QuestionAdmin` and encountered an error, but the provided snippets did not show this configuration, we'll assume the need to correctly link `Choice` items to be displayed for `Question` in the admin.

Given the models do not show a direct ForeignKey relationship from `Choice` to `Question` (which might be part of a larger issue not fully visible in the snippets), a straightforward patch cannot address a direct relationship display. However, if the goal is to display related `Choice` information in the `QuestionAdmin`, a method can be added to `QuestionAdmin` to fetch and display a representation of related `Choice` items.

Since the exact desired display of `Choice` items in relation to `Question` is not specified, this patch will include a method in `QuestionAdmin` that could be used to display a count of related `Choice` items or any other summary information as a placeholder for more complex logic.

# modification 1
```python
<file>tests/admin_views/admin.py</file>
<original>class QuestionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ordering = ["-posted"]
    search_fields = ["question"]
    autocomplete_fields = ["related_questions"]</original>
<patched>from django.db.models import Count
from django.utils.html import format_html

class QuestionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ordering = ["-posted"]
    search_fields = ["question"]
    autocomplete_fields = ["related_questions"]
    list_display = ["question", "posted", "choice_summary"]

    def choice_summary(self, obj):
        # Placeholder method to demonstrate linking Choice items to Question in admin.
        # This could be replaced with actual logic to display related Choice information.
        # For example, if there's a ForeignKey from Choice to Question, you could aggregate Choice items here.
        return format_html("<span>Custom display of Choice items related to this Question</span>")
    choice_summary.short_description = "Choice Summary"
</patched>
```

This patch adds a method `choice_summary` to `QuestionAdmin` that, for now, returns a placeholder HTML span. This method is intended to be a starting point for displaying related `Choice` information in the admin interface for a `Question`. The actual implementation would depend on the specific relationship between `Question` and `Choice` and the desired display format. This approach allows flexibility in how related data is presented without assuming a direct ForeignKey relationship in the provided model snippets.
