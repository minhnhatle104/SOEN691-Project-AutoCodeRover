        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into the structure of the `Question` and `Choice` models, the configuration of `list_display` in `QuestionAdmin` (or rather `ChoiceList` as per the search result), and the implementation details of the `_get_non_gfk_field` method. Here's a breakdown of the findings and their implications:\n\n1. **Question and Choice Models**: \n   - The `Question` and `Choice` models are found in multiple test files, with `tests/admin_views/models.py` being a common file for both. This suggests that the models are used together in the context of admin views, which aligns with the issue description.\n   - Without the specific structure of these models, it's hard to pinpoint the exact issue, but the problem likely revolves around how these models are related or how the `Choice` model is referenced in the admin configuration.\n\n2. **Admin Configuration**:\n   - The search for `list_display = [\"choice\"]` led to a snippet in `tests/admin_views/admin.py`, but it's under `class ChoiceList(admin.ModelAdmin)` rather than `QuestionAdmin`. This might have been a misunderstanding in the issue description or a misconfiguration in the project. The `ChoiceList` class explicitly references `\"choice\"` in `list_display`, `readonly_fields`, and `fields`.\n   - The absence of a `label_for_field` method in `QuestionAdmin` suggests that the issue is not due to a custom implementation but rather a misconfiguration or misunderstanding of Django's admin system.\n\n3. **_get_non_gfk_field Method**:\n   - The method's implementation in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` is designed to exclude generic foreign keys and reverse relations from being treated as fields. This is because they do not represent direct attributes of the model.\n   - The error `FieldDoesNotExist` is raised if the field is a relation that doesn't have a related model (like a generic foreign key) or is a reverse relation. Additionally, if the field name matches the `attname` of a relation but is not a many-to-many relation, it raises `FieldIsAForeignKeyColumnName`.\n\nGiven these findings, the issue seems to stem from a misunderstanding or misconfiguration related to the `list_display` attribute in the admin configuration. The error occurs because Django's admin system is unable to find a direct field or attribute named `choice` on the `Question` model or within its admin configuration (`QuestionAdmin`), leading to the `AttributeError`.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to:\n- Verify the relationship between `Question` and `Choice` models and how they are intended to be displayed in the admin interface.\n- Correct the admin configuration to ensure that `list_display` references valid fields or attributes.\n- Consider implementing a method in `QuestionAdmin` that returns the desired display value for `choice` if it's not a direct field but a computed value or related object attribute.\n\nFurther steps would involve looking into the `Question` and `Choice` models' definitions in `tests/admin_views/models.py` to understand their relationship and adjusting the admin configuration accordingly."

        "content": "The additional context obtained from the search results provides a clearer picture of the `Question` and `Choice` models, as well as the `QuestionAdmin` configuration. Here's an analysis based on the new information:\n\n1. **Question Model**:\n   - Defined in `tests/admin_views/models.py`, the `Question` model has a `big_id` as a primary key and a `question` field of type `CharField`.\n   - There is no direct reference or relationship to the `Choice` model within the `Question` model as per the provided snippet.\n\n2. **Choice Model**:\n   - Also defined in `tests/admin_views/models.py`, the `Choice` model includes a `choice` field of type `IntegerField`.\n   - Similar to the `Question` model, the snippet does not show any direct relationship between `Choice` and `Question`. However, the presence of both models in the same file suggests they are related in some way, possibly through another field or model not shown in the snippet.\n\n3. **QuestionAdmin Configuration**:\n   - Found in `tests/admin_views/admin.py`, the `QuestionAdmin` class configures the admin interface for the `Question` model. It specifies ordering by the `-posted` field and allows searching by the `question` field.\n   - Notably, the `list_display` attribute is not mentioned in the provided snippet for `QuestionAdmin`, which means the issue might not directly involve `QuestionAdmin` but rather a misunderstanding or misconfiguration related to how `Choice` is intended to be displayed in relation to `Question`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the issue seems to stem from a misunderstanding or misconfiguration regarding the display of `Choice` items in the Django admin interface. The initial issue description mentioned an error when setting `list_display = [\"choice\"]` in `QuestionAdmin`, but the provided snippets do not show this configuration. Instead, we found a similar configuration in `ChoiceList`, which might have been confused with `QuestionAdmin`.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The bug is likely due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding of how to display related `Choice` items for `Question` in the Django admin. The error occurs because the admin system cannot find a direct field or attribute named `choice` on the `Question` model or within its admin configuration (`QuestionAdmin`), leading to the `AttributeError`.\n- A potential solution would involve correctly configuring the admin interface to display related `Choice` items for a `Question`. This could be achieved by defining a method in `QuestionAdmin` that fetches the related `Choice` items and adding this method to `list_display`, or by correctly configuring the relationship between `Question` and `Choice` models if it's not properly set up.\n\nTo resolve the issue, further investigation into how `Question` and `Choice` are intended to be related and displayed in the admin interface is needed. This might involve examining the rest of the model definitions in `tests/admin_views/models.py` and adjusting the admin configuration in `tests/admin_views/admin.py` accordingly."
