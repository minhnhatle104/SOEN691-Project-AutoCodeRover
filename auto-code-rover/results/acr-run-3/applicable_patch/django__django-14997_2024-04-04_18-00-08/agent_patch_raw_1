Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential patch could involve ensuring that expressions within unique constraints are handled correctly during the `_remake_table` process. Since the specific cause of the error ("the '.' operator prohibited in index expressions") suggests a problem with how expressions are reconstructed in the new table, a hypothetical patch might involve adjusting the handling of such expressions or constraints in the `_remake_table` method. However, without a specific line or expression causing the issue identified, the following patch is speculative and aims to provide a general direction for resolving the issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py</file>
<original>self.execute("INSERT INTO %s (%s) SELECT %s FROM %s" % (
    self.quote_name(new_model._meta.db_table),
    ', '.join(self.quote_name(x) for x in mapping),
    ', '.join(mapping.values()),
    self.quote_name(model._meta.db_table),
))</original>
<patched># Before executing the INSERT INTO operation, ensure that any expressions in the mapping are
# properly formatted for SQLite. This might involve translating expressions or handling specific cases
# where the '.' operator is used inappropriately for SQLite.
# This is a placeholder for the actual logic needed to handle expressions correctly.
# The actual implementation would depend on the specific expressions causing issues and SQLite's capabilities.
prepared_mapping_values = []
for value in mapping.values():
    # Placeholder for logic to handle/transform expressions as needed for SQLite
    if "expression logic condition":
        value = "transformed expression"
    prepared_mapping_values.append(value)

self.execute("INSERT INTO %s (%s) SELECT %s FROM %s" % (
    self.quote_name(new_model._meta.db_table),
    ', '.join(self.quote_name(x) for x in mapping),
    ', '.join(prepared_mapping_values),
    self.quote_name(model._meta.db_table),
))</patched>
```

Please note, the above patch is highly speculative and serves as an example of how one might begin to address the issue based on the provided context. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the expressions causing the issue, how they're used within unique constraints, and SQLite's syntax requirements. Further investigation and testing would be necessary to develop a functional patch.
