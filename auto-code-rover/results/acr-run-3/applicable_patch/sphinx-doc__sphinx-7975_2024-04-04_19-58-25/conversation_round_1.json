This suggests that the functionality related to the issue might be embedded within more general methods or classes that are not immediately obvious from the search terms used.\n\nWithout direct leads, we need to consider a broader approach to identify where the issue might be originating from. The problem described involves categorization and ordering of index entries, especially symbols, and the generation of HTML output with anchors. This functionality could be part of a larger system dealing with document parsing, formatting, or rendering.\n\nGiven this, we should consider searching for:\n\n1. Methods or classes related to document parsing or rendering, as they might handle the index entries as part of their process.\n2. Code that deals with sorting or categorizing entries, which might have special cases or conditions for symbols.\n3. HTML anchor generation logic, which could reveal how anchors are assigned to different sections, including the symbols section.\n\nHowever, without specific search terms from the initial results, we need to hypothesize based on common practices and naming conventions in software development related to document processing or HTML generation. Here are a few alternative search strategies:\n\n- Look for methods or classes that might be involved in document processing or HTML generation in a broader sense. This could include methods like `renderHTML`, `processDocument`, or classes like `DocumentRenderer`, `HTMLGenerator`.\n- Since the issue involves sorting or categorizing symbols differently, searching for code related to sorting or categorization logic might be helpful. This could involve searches like `search_code(\"sort\")`, `search_code(\"categorize\")`.\n- Considering the issue might be with how anchors are created or managed, searching for code related to anchor management might be useful. This could involve searches like `search_code(\"createAnchor\")`, `search_code(\"HTML anchor\")`.\n\nGiven the lack of specific leads from the initial searches, these broader strategies might help us identify the relevant parts of the codebase that could be contributing to the issue."
