Given the description of the issue, it seems relevant to look into methods or classes that deal with index entry processing, HTML output generation, and possibly sorting or categorizing these entries. \n\nLet's start by searching for methods or classes that might be directly involved with the index generation or handling symbols in index entries:\n\n1. `search_method(\"generateIndex\")`: This search could help us find a method responsible for generating the index, which might include logic for categorizing symbols and other entries.\n\n2. `search_class(\"IndexGenerator\")`: If there's a dedicated class for index generation, it might contain methods or logic that handle the categorization and HTML anchor creation.\n\n3. `search_code(\"Symbols in index\")`: This search might help us find comments or code snippets specifically referring to the handling of symbols in the index, which could lead us to the relevant parts of the codebase.\n\nThese searches are aimed at finding the relevant parts of the code that could contain the logic responsible for the issue described."
