This patch addresses the issue by explicitly checking if the `__all__` attribute is set to an empty list in the module. If `__all__` is an empty list, `want_all` is set to `False`, ensuring that no members are documented. This approach respects the user's intention when they explicitly set `__all__` to an empty list, aligning the behavior with the expected outcome described in the issue.
