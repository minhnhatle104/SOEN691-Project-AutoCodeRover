The following API calls will help in understanding the existing implementation and identifying where changes are needed:\n\n1. `search_class(\"syndication.views\")`: This will help in understanding the structure of the syndication views, including any relevant methods that might be involved in adding items to feeds.\n\n2. `search_method(\"add_item\")`: Since the issue mentions modifying the `add_item()` method to support a `comments` argument, searching for this method will help identify all occurrences and their respective files or classes, providing a broader view of where changes might be needed.\n\n3. `search_code(\"item_extra_kwargs\")`: This search will help in understanding how `item_extra_kwargs` is currently used in the context of adding items to feeds, which is relevant since the issue suggests that adding comments directly would be a more straightforward approach than using `item_extra_kwargs`.\n\n4. `search_code(\"feedparser\")`: Given that the issue mentions `comments` is explicitly mentioned in the `feedparser` but not implemented in the view, searching for `feedparser` usage will help in understanding how it's currently integrated and where the gap in implementing `comments` might be."
