Given the constraints and the nature of the issue with Pylint's handling of `\p{Han}` in regular expressions within the `.pylintrc` configuration file, a direct patch cannot be provided without access to the specific implementation details of Pylint's codebase as of my last update. However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the issue, based on the general understanding of Python's regex capabilities and the error described.

The core of the issue lies in the Python `re` module's lack of support for Unicode property escapes, such as `\p{Han}`. A potential solution involves using the `regex` module, which offers broader Unicode support, including property escapes. This solution would entail modifying the parts of Pylint that compile and use regular expressions from the configuration files to use the `regex` module instead of `re`.

Here's a conceptual patch based on this approach:

# modification 1
```python
<file>pylint/checkers/base/name_checker/naming_style.py</file>
<original>
import re
</original>
<patched>
try:
    import regex as re
except ImportError:
    import re
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>pylint/config/arguments_manager.py</file>
<original>
import re
</original>
<patched>
try:
    import regex as re
except ImportError:
    import re
</patched>
```

**Explanation**:
- **Modification 1 & 2**: These changes suggest attempting to import the `regex` module as `re` if it's available, falling back to Python's built-in `re` module if not. This approach allows Pylint to benefit from `regex`'s extended capabilities, including support for `\p{Han}`, without breaking existing functionality if `regex` is not installed.

**Additional Steps**:
- **Ensure `regex` is Installed**: For this patch to be effective, the `regex` module must be installed in the environment where Pylint runs. This could be added to Pylint's installation requirements or documented as a necessary step for users needing advanced regex features.
- **Testing**: Extensive testing is required to ensure that switching to the `regex` module does not introduce regressions or affect performance negatively.
- **Documentation**: Update Pylint's documentation to reflect the change and guide users on how to install the `regex` module if they need support for Unicode property escapes in their regular expressions.

This conceptual patch is a starting point and would need to be validated and possibly adjusted based on the specific implementation details of Pylint and the environments it supports.
