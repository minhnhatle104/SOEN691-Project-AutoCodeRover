        "content": "<issue>Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same.\nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\nreturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\nRawSQL('''\ncase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\nthen 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\nRawSQL('''\ncase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\nthen (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\nelse null end''', []).asc(),\nRawSQL('''\ncase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\nthen (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\nelse null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line.\nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases).\nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n</issue>"

The problem occurs when the method attempts to eliminate duplicate order by clauses by comparing the SQL snippets generated for each clause. The method uses a regular expression search (`ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)`) to extract a part of the SQL query that excludes the ordering direction (ASC or DESC). This extracted part is then used to check for duplicates. However, when RawSQL expressions are used, especially multiline ones, this approach can mistakenly identify different order by clauses as duplicates if their last lines (minus the ordering direction) are identical. This is because the regular expression search does not consider the entirety of the multiline SQL but rather focuses on a specific part that can be common across different clauses.\n\n### Code Analysis:\n1. **Location of Issue**: The issue is located in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file within the `get_order_by` method of the `SQLCompiler` class. This method is responsible for constructing the ORDER BY clause of the SQL query.\n\n2. **Method Logic**: The `get_order_by` method processes each field specified in the order_by clause of a Django QuerySet. For fields that are expressions (e.g., RawSQL), it resolves these expressions and compiles them into SQL. It then attempts to prevent the addition of duplicate order by clauses by checking if the SQL snippet (minus the ordering direction) has already been seen.\n\n3. **Problematic Code Snippet**: The specific line of code causing the issue is:\n   ```python\n   without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\n   ```\n   This line extracts a part of the SQL snippet to check for duplicates, but it does not handle multiline RawSQL expressions correctly, leading to erroneous identification of duplicates.\n\n### Problem Summary:\nThe core of the problem lies in the handling of multiline RawSQL expressions in the `get_order_by` method. The method's current logic for identifying duplicates does not account for the full context of multiline expressions, leading to the incorrect removal of valid order by clauses.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven this analysis, the next steps involve devising a solution that can accurately handle multiline RawSQL expressions without mistakenly identifying them as duplicates. This might involve enhancing the regular expression used or changing the logic for how SQL snippets are compared for duplication. Additionally, any solution will need to be mindful of potential edge cases, such as differences in whitespace, line endings, and Unicode characters, as mentioned in the issue description."

This approach ensures that the comparison accounts for the entirety of the RawSQL expression, rather than just a part of it, which could lead to incorrect identification of duplicates. The use of `splitlines()` ensures compatibility with different newline characters across operating systems, addressing the concern about newline (EOL) characters mentioned in the issue description."
