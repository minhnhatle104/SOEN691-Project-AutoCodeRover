This patch addresses the issue by converting the multiline SQL string into a single line before performing the duplicate check. This approach ensures that the comparison accounts for the entirety of the RawSQL expression, rather than just a part of it, which could lead to incorrect identification of duplicates. The use of `splitlines()` ensures compatibility with different newline characters across operating systems, addressing the concern about newline (EOL) characters mentioned in the issue description.
