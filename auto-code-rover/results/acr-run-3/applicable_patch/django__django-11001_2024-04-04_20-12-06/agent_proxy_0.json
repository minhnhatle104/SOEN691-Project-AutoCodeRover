Additionally, understanding the context of how `ordering_parts` is used and defined will be crucial. Here are the API calls that would help in gathering the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SQLCompiler\")`: This will help us locate the file or files where the `SQLCompiler` class is defined. Knowing the location of this class is essential for further investigation and for understanding how the `get_order_by` method fits within the larger context of the class.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get_order_by\", \"SQLCompiler\")`: This call will provide us with details about the `get_order_by` method within the `SQLCompiler` class, including its implementation details that are relevant to the issue at hand.\n\n3. `search_code(\"ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\")`: Since the issue mentions a specific line of code involving `ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)`, searching for this code snippet will help us understand how and where exactly in the codebase this logic is applied. This is crucial for identifying the bug's location and understanding its impact.\n\nThese API calls are targeted to gather detailed information about the components mentioned in the issue description, which will be instrumental in devising a suitable patch."
