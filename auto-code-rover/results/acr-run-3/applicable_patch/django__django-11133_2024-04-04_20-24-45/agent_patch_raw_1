```

This patch adds a condition to the `content` setter in the `HttpResponse` class to check if the value being assigned is an instance of `memoryview`. If it is, it converts the `memoryview` to bytes using the `bytes()` constructor before assigning it to the `_container`. This ensures that `memoryview` objects are correctly handled and converted to bytes, preserving their content as expected.
