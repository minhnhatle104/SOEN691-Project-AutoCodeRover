        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified three relevant points in the codebase where the `trigsimp` function is implemented or utilized:\n\n1. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py**: This file contains the primary implementation of the `trigsimp` function. The function aims to reduce expressions by using known trigonometric identities. It supports various methods for simplification, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. The detailed documentation within the code suggests that this function is quite flexible and can be extended or modified to handle new patterns or identities.\n\n2. **sympy/vector/basisdependent.py**: In the `BasisDependent` class, the `trigsimp` method is implemented to apply the SymPy `trigsimp` routine specifically to quantities that are basis-dependent. This suggests that the simplification process can also be applied to vector components, indicating a broader application of trigonometric simplification within the library.\n\n3. **sympy/core/expr.py**: The `Expr` class has a `trigsimp` method that essentially acts as a wrapper for the `trigsimp` function defined in `sympy.simplify.trigsimp`. This allows any expression object to directly call `trigsimp` on itself, simplifying the expression using trigonometric identities.\n\nGiven the issue description, the primary concern is to enhance the `trigsimp` function to recognize and simplify expressions involving exponential forms into trigonometric identities, specifically targeting the conversion to `sin(k)` and `sinc(k)`. The current implementation in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` seems to be the most relevant place to introduce these enhancements. \n\nTo address the issue, we would need to:\n- Examine the current patterns and methods (`'matching'`, `'groebner'`, `'combined'`, and `'fu'`) used in `trigsimp` to identify how they can be extended or modified to recognize and simplify the given exponential expressions.\n- Consider implementing new patterns or extending existing ones to specifically target the conversion of exponential forms to trigonometric functions and their respective identities.\n- Ensure that any new implementation does not adversely affect the performance or accuracy of existing simplification capabilities.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to modify the `trigsimp` function with the capability to recognize and simplify the specified exponential expressions into trigonometric identities."
