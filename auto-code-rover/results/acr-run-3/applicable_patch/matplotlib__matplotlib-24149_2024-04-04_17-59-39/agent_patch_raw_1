```

This modification addresses the issue by providing a fallback value of `np.nan` when no finite value is found by `_safe_first_finite`. This change ensures that the method can gracefully handle cases where all input data are `NaN`, preventing the `StopIteration` exception from being raised and allowing the rest of the `Axes.bar` logic to proceed without error.
