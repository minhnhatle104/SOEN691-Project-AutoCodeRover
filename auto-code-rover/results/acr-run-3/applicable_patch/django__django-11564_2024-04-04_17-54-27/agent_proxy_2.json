To ensure we have pinpointed the precise locations for the necessary changes, let's perform additional searches focusing on the `url` method implementations within the `FileSystemStorage` and `StaticFilesStorage` classes, as these are key to generating URLs and are likely where adjustments need to be made to accommodate `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\n### Additional Search API Calls\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"url\", \"FileSystemStorage\")`: This will provide the exact implementation details of the `url` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class, allowing us to understand how URLs are currently generated and where to integrate `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"url\", \"StaticFilesStorage\")`: Although `StaticFilesStorage` inherits from `FileSystemStorage`, it may override the `url` method. This search will clarify if there's a specific implementation in `StaticFilesStorage` that also needs modification.\n\nThese additional searches aim to locate the precise methods within the classes where the logic for handling `SCRIPT_NAME` should be integrated."
