When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.\nThis problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.\nThis can be easily added into default Django static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:\ndef render(self, context):\nurl = self.url(context)\n# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME']\nif self.varname is None:\nreturn url\ncontext[self.varname] = url\nreturn ''\nOn more research I found that FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage ignores SCRIPT_NAME as well.\nWe might have to do a lot of changes but I think it's worth the efforts.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, let's analyze the relevant parts of the Django codebase that are implicated in the issue described.\n\n### StaticNode.render Method\n\nThe `StaticNode.render` method in `django/templatetags/static.py` is responsible for rendering the URL for static files when the `{% static '...' %}` template tag is used. The current implementation retrieves the URL, potentially escapes it for HTML, and then either returns it directly or sets it in the context under a variable name. Notably, there is no consideration of the `SCRIPT_NAME` WSGI parameter in constructing the URL.\n\n### FileSystemStorage Class\n\nThe `FileSystemStorage` class in `django/core/files/storage.py` provides a way for managing static and media files on the filesystem. It includes methods for opening, saving, deleting files, and importantly, generating URLs for them (`url` method). The class does not appear to directly consider `SCRIPT_NAME` in generating these URLs, based on the provided code snippet.\n\n### StaticFilesStorage Class\n\nThe `StaticFilesStorage` class in `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` inherits from `FileSystemStorage` and is specifically tailored for handling static files. It overrides a few methods, but most of its URL handling would inherit the behavior of `FileSystemStorage`, including the lack of `SCRIPT_NAME` consideration.\n\n### Analysis Summary\n\nThe issue at hand is the lack of `SCRIPT_NAME` prefix in URLs generated for static and media files when Django is deployed in a sub-path environment. This affects both template-generated URLs (via the `{% static '...' %}` tag) and URLs generated by the storage backends for static and media files (`FileSystemStorage` and `StaticFilesStorage`).\n\nTo address this issue, modifications would need to be made in:\n\n1. **StaticNode.render Method**: Incorporate `SCRIPT_NAME` into the URL construction process.\n2. **FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage Classes**: Ensure that the `url` method in these classes respects `SCRIPT_NAME` when generating URLs.\n\nThese changes would allow Django applications to correctly generate URLs for static and media files when deployed under a sub-path, dynamically handling the `SCRIPT_NAME` prefix."

Let's analyze the findings:\n\n### FileSystemStorage.url Method\n\nThe `url` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class constructs the URL for a given file name. The process is as follows:\n\n1. It first checks if `base_url` is set; if not, it raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the file cannot be accessed via a URL.\n2. It then uses `filepath_to_uri` to convert the file name into a URI.\n3. If the resulting URI is not `None`, it strips any leading slashes from it.\n4. Finally, it joins this URI with `base_url` using `urljoin` to form the complete URL.\n\nThis method does not currently consider the `SCRIPT_NAME` environment variable, which is necessary for correctly prefixing URLs when Django is deployed in a sub-directory of a domain.\n\n### StaticFilesStorage.url Method\n\nThe search did not find an explicit `url` method within the `StaticFilesStorage` class, which implies that `StaticFilesStorage` inherits the `url` method directly from `FileSystemStorage` without overriding it. This means any changes made to the `FileSystemStorage.url` method to accommodate `SCRIPT_NAME` will also apply to `StaticFilesStorage`.\n\n### Analysis Summary\n\nTo address the issue described, the `url` method in `FileSystemStorage` needs to be modified to prepend the `SCRIPT_NAME` to the generated URLs. Since `StaticFilesStorage` does not override the `url` method, it will inherit this behavior, thus resolving the issue for both static and media files.\n\n### Precise Bug Location\n\n- **Buggy File and Method for URL Handling**:\n  - **File**: `django/core/files/storage.py`\n  - **Class**: `FileSystemStorage`\n  - **Method**: `url`\n  - **Description**: This method needs to be updated to prepend `SCRIPT_NAME` to the generated URLs for files it manages. This change will ensure that when Django is deployed in a sub-path, the generated URLs for static and media files correctly reflect the deployment path.\n\nGiven this analysis, we have a clear understanding of where the changes need to be made to resolve the issue."
