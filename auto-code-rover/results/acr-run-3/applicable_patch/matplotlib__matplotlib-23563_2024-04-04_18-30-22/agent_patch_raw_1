This modification adds a check to ensure that `_verts3d` is set before attempting to access it in the `draw` method of the `Line3D` class. If `_verts3d` is not set, it issues a warning and skips the drawing of the `Line3D` object, preventing the `AttributeError` from being raised. This approach allows for more graceful handling of cases where the necessary 3D properties have not been initialized, providing feedback to the developer or user without crashing the program.
