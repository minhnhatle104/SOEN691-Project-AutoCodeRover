When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console. I don't know why it happens, so I come here for help.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nx_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nx_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\ny_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\ny_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nz_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nz_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\nax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\nax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\nclr_list = 'r-'\nfor n in range(np.size(z_s_0, axis=0)):\nax.plot([int(x_s_0[n]), int(x_e_0[n])],\n[int(y_s_0[n]), int(y_e_0[n])],\n[int(z_s_0[n]), int(z_e_0[n])], clr_list)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\n# ax.zlabel('z')\nplt.title('90-0')\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 3444, in run_code\nexec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\nFile \"<ipython-input-80-e04907066a16>\", line 20, in <module>\nplt.show()\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 368, in show\nreturn _backend_mod.show(*args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 29, in __call__\nmanager.show(**kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 112, in show\nself.canvas.show()\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 68, in show\nFigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\", line 436, in draw\nself.figure.draw(self.renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 73, in draw_wrapper\nresult = draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py\", line 2803, in draw\nmimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\na.draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 469, in draw\nsuper().draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", line 3082, in draw\nmimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\na.draw(renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\nreturn draw(artist, renderer)\nFile \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 215, in draw\nxs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d\nAttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Expected outcome\nSome 3D lines\n### Additional information\n_No response_\n### Operating system\nLocal: windows + pycharm, Remote: Ubuntu 20.04\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.5.0\n### Matplotlib Backend\nmodule://backend_interagg\n### Python version\n3.8.12\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\npip\n</issue>"

The error message indicates that there's an attempt to access an attribute `_verts3d` that does not exist on the `Line3D` object under certain conditions. This suggests that either the attribute is not being set correctly or its usage is not handled properly under specific scenarios.\n\nGiven this, we should start by looking into the `Line3D` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that might interact with the `_verts3d` attribute. Additionally, since the traceback involves the drawing process (`draw` method), it would be beneficial to examine how `Line3D` objects are drawn, specifically in the 3D plotting context.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"Line3D\")` - To get an overview of the `Line3D` class and its attributes.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"draw\", \"Line3D\")` - To understand how `Line3D` objects are drawn and how `_verts3d` might be involved in this process."

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we can analyze the context around the `Line3D` class and its `draw` method to understand the issue better and formulate a solution.\n\n### Analysis of `Line3D` Class\nThe `Line3D` class is a subclass of `lines.Line2D` and is defined in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py`. It includes several methods relevant to 3D line objects, such as:\n- `__init__(self, xs, ys, zs, *args, **kwargs)`: Constructor for initializing the `Line3D` object with x, y, and z coordinates.\n- `set_3d_properties(self, zs=0, zdir='z')`: Method for setting 3D properties.\n- `set_data_3d(self, *args)`: Method for setting 3D data.\n- `get_data_3d(self)`: Method for getting 3D data.\n- `draw(self, renderer)`: Method overridden to draw the `Line3D` object, which is crucial for rendering.\n\n### Analysis of `draw` Method in `Line3D`\nThe `draw` method in the `Line3D` class attempts to access an attribute `_verts3d` and then uses the `proj3d.proj_transform` function to transform these 3D vertices into 2D projection coordinates. After transforming the coordinates, it sets the data for the base class (`Line2D`) and calls its `draw` method to perform the actual drawing.\n\n### Identified Issue\nThe error message reported in the issue (`AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'`) indicates that the `_verts3d` attribute is not set or accessible when the `draw` method is called. This could happen if the `set_3d_properties` or `set_data_3d` methods, which presumably should set this attribute, are not called or fail to set the attribute before the `draw` method is invoked.\n\n### Potential Solution Approach\nTo resolve this issue, we need to ensure that `_verts3d` is correctly set before the `draw` method is called. This could involve:\n1. Investigating where and how `set_3d_properties` and `set_data_3d` are called in relation to `draw`. It's crucial to ensure these methods are successfully executed and `_verts3d` is set.\n2. Implementing a check within the `draw` method to verify `_verts3d` is set. If not, either raise a more informative error or handle the condition gracefully.\n3. Reviewing the logic that leads to the transformation and drawing process to ensure that all necessary properties and data are correctly initialized and set.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Review the call sequence and dependencies between `set_3d_properties`, `set_data_3d`, and `draw` to identify any gaps or issues in the workflow.\n- Consider adding error handling or initialization checks within the `draw` method to manage the absence of `_verts3d` more gracefully.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for addressing the reported issue. The next step would involve modifying the code to implement the identified solution approach."
