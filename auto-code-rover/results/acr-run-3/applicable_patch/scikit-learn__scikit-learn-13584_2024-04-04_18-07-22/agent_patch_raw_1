Given the context and the issue at hand, the problem seems to stem from how numpy arrays are handled when `print_changed_only=True` is set. Specifically, the error occurs because the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous when trying to determine which parameters have changed. This issue likely arises in the handling of parameters within the `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter` class, particularly in methods that format parameters or dict items. However, without a specific error line or a clear indication of where numpy arrays are improperly handled, the exact patch cannot be pinpointed with absolute certainty. 

A hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that numpy arrays are properly converted to a string representation before any truth value checks or comparisons are made. Since the exact line or method causing the issue is not specified, I'll provide a general approach that could be adapted:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/utils/_pprint.py</file>
<original>
params = _changed_params(object)
</original>
<patched>
# Ensure numpy arrays are converted to their string representation to avoid ambiguity in truth value checks
params = {k: (v.tolist() if hasattr(v, "tolist") else v) for k, v in _changed_params(object).items()}
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/utils/_pprint.py</file>
<original>
params = object.get_params(deep=False)
</original>
<patched>
# Convert numpy arrays in parameters to lists to ensure they are represented correctly
params = {k: (v.tolist() if hasattr(v, "tolist") else v) for k, v in object.get_params(deep=False).items()}
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address potential issues with numpy array parameters by ensuring they are represented in a manner that avoids ambiguity in truth value checks. The `.tolist()` method is called on numpy arrays to convert them to lists, which should not raise the same error when evaluated. This approach assumes that the error occurs during the handling of parameters that have changed or are being formatted for printing, which is consistent with the described issue. 

Please note, these patches are speculative and based on the assumption of where the issue might be occurring. Further investigation and testing would be required to confirm the exact location and nature of the bug, and to validate the effectiveness of these patches.
