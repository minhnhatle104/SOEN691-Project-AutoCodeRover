Given the information in the issue, it seems pertinent to look into the `LogisticRegressionCV` class, the `set_config` function, and possibly how numpy arrays are handled within the `LogisticRegressionCV` class or related functions. Here are the API calls I would make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LogisticRegressionCV\")` - This will help understand the structure of the `LogisticRegressionCV` class and any relevant methods that might interact with the `Cs` parameter.\n2. `search_method(\"set_config\")` - Since the issue arises after calling `sklearn.set_config(print_changed_only=True)`, it's important to understand what this function does and how it might affect the printing or handling of numpy arrays.\n3. `search_code(\"print_changed_only=True\")` - This will help find other places in the code where `print_changed_only` is used or modified, which could provide clues on how it's supposed to work with numpy arrays."
