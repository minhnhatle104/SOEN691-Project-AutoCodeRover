Here's a breakdown of the information gathered:\n\n1. **LogisticRegressionCV Class**:\n   - Located in `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`.\n   - Inherits from `LogisticRegression`, `BaseEstimator`, and `LinearClassifierMixin`.\n   - The constructor (`__init__`) accepts a parameter `Cs` which can be a number or an array. This is relevant because the issue arises when passing a numpy array to `Cs`.\n   - Contains methods like `fit` and `score`, but the issue doesn't seem directly related to these methods based on the description.\n\n2. **set_config Function**:\n   - Located in `sklearn/_config.py`.\n   - Allows setting global scikit-learn configuration, including the `print_changed_only` parameter.\n   - When `print_changed_only` is set to `True`, only parameters that were set to non-default values will be printed. This is directly related to the issue, as the error occurs when trying to print the `LogisticRegressionCV` instance with a numpy array passed to `Cs` after `print_changed_only` has been set to `True`.\n\n3. **Usage of print_changed_only=True**:\n   - Found in `examples/plot_changed_only_pprint_parameter.py` and `sklearn/utils/tests/test_pprint.py`.\n   - These examples and tests demonstrate the intended functionality of `print_changed_only=True`, which is to simplify the output of object representations by only showing parameters that have been changed from their default values.\n   - The test case in `test_pprint.py` specifically tests that the `__repr__` method of `LogisticRegression` behaves as expected when `print_changed_only=True` is set and a parameter (`C`) is changed from its default.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how the `__repr__` method of `LogisticRegressionCV` (or possibly a method it inherits from) handles the `Cs` parameter when it's a numpy array and `print_changed_only=True` is set. The error message suggests that there's an attempt to evaluate the truth value of the numpy array, which is ambiguous and not allowed by numpy.\n\nThe next steps should involve examining how the `__repr__` method is implemented for `LogisticRegressionCV` and related classes, and how the `print_changed_only` configuration is used to alter its behavior. Specifically, we need to understand how parameters like `Cs` are being evaluated or printed in this method, and why passing a numpy array leads to the error. This will likely involve looking into the implementation details of the `__repr__` method and any utility functions it uses to handle the `print_changed_only` logic."

This implies that `LogisticRegressionCV` inherits its `__repr__` method from one of its parent classes.\n\n2. **`__repr__` Method in `BaseEstimator`**:\n   - The `__repr__` method is indeed found in the `BaseEstimator` class, located in `sklearn/base.py`. This method is likely used by `LogisticRegressionCV` for its representation.\n   - The method utilizes `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter` from `sklearn.utils._pprint` for formatting. It has logic to handle long representations by inserting ellipses and limits the number of elements to show in sequences.\n   - Given the issue involves handling numpy arrays and the `print_changed_only=True` setting, the interaction between `__repr__`, `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter`, and how sequences (like numpy arrays) are handled is crucial.\n\n3. **Multiple `__repr__` Implementations**:\n   - The search for `def __repr__(self):` across the codebase returned 36 snippets, indicating that many classes have their custom `__repr__` implementations. However, since `LogisticRegressionCV` does not have its own, it relies on the one from `BaseEstimator`.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The bug likely resides in how the `__repr__` method in `BaseEstimator` (or the utilities it uses, such as `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter`) handles the `Cs` parameter when it's a numpy array, especially under the `print_changed_only=True` configuration.\n- Since `LogisticRegressionCV` does not override `__repr__`, it inherits the behavior from `BaseEstimator`. The issue arises when trying to represent the `Cs` parameter, which is a numpy array. The error message suggests a problem with evaluating the truth value of an array, which might be related to how sequences are handled or represented.\n- The interaction between the `print_changed_only` setting and the representation of parameters that are numpy arrays or sequences needs to be carefully reviewed. Specifically, the logic within `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter` and how it decides which parameters to include in the representation and how to format them could be where the problem lies.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Investigate the implementation of `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter` in `sklearn.utils._pprint`, focusing on how it formats sequences and interacts with the `print_changed_only` configuration.\n- Review how `BaseEstimator`'s `__repr__` method and `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter` handle parameters like `Cs` that are numpy arrays, to identify where the ambiguity in truth value evaluation occurs.\n- Propose a patch that ensures numpy arrays are correctly handled when `print_changed_only=True` is set, possibly by adjusting how sequences are represented or evaluated in the context of `__repr__`."
