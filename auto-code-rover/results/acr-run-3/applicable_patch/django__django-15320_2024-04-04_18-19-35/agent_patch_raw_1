```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>        template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql[1:-1]</original>
<patched>        if subquery_sql.startswith('(') and subquery_sql.endswith(')'):
            template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql[1:-1]
        else:
            template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by adding a conditional check to ensure that the first and last characters of the `subquery_sql` string are parentheses before attempting to remove them. If the string does not start and end with parentheses, it leaves the string unaltered. This approach prevents the generation of invalid SQL by preserving the original `subquery_sql` when the assumptions about its format do not hold.
