Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n### `skip` Function Implementation\n- **Location**: `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`\n- **Functionality**: The `skip` function allows tests to be skipped during execution with a specified message. It has an optional parameter `allow_module_level` which, when set to `True`, enables the function to be called at the module level, effectively skipping the rest of the module.\n- **Usage Note**: The documentation within the code advises that it's generally better to use the `pytest.mark.skipif` marker for conditionally skipping tests based on certain conditions (e.g., platform or dependency mismatches). It also mentions the use of `# doctest: +SKIP` for statically skipping doctests.\n\n### Usage of `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip`\n- **Occurrences**: Found in 4 snippets across 2 files (`testing/test_mark.py` and `testing/test_skipping.py`).\n- **Context**: This usage pattern is recommended for skipping entire modules but, as reported in the issue, fails to prevent the processing of the file which leads to syntax errors when encountering Python 3.8 specific syntax in environments with Python versions older than 3.8.\n\n### Analysis\nThe issue at hand is twofold:\n1. **Documentation and Guidance**: The error message encountered when trying to use `skip` outside of a test suggests using `pytest.mark.skip` or `pytest.mark.skipif` at the module level. However, this advice does not account for scenarios where Python syntax incompatibilities prevent the file from being processed correctly in the first place. The documentation and error messages could be improved to address this specific use case more clearly.\n2. **Functionality Gap**: There seems to be a functionality gap for cleanly skipping modules that contain syntax or features not supported by the runtime Python version. While `allow_module_level=True` in the `skip` function provides a workaround, it's not prominently featured in guidance, and there might be a need for a more intuitive API or mechanism for this purpose.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the analysis, the next steps could involve:\n- Proposing enhancements to the documentation to include guidance on using `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` for scenarios involving syntax incompatibilities.\n- Considering the development of a new API or enhancing existing mechanisms to more gracefully handle module-level skipping in cases of Python version incompatibilities, possibly through a `skip_module` function or similar.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for drafting solutions to address the reported issue effectively.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

             '- **Location**: `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`\n'
             '- **Functionality**: The `skip` function allows tests to be skipped during execution with a specified message. It has an optional parameter '
             '`allow_module_level` which, when set to `True`, enables the function to be called at the module level, effectively skipping the rest of the '
             'module.\n'
             "- **Usage Note**: The documentation within the code advises that it's generally better to use the `pytest.mark.skipif` marker for conditionally "

             'the file from being processed correctly in the first place. The documentation and error messages could be improved to address this specific use '
             'case more clearly.\n'

             '\n'
             '### `skip` Function Implementation\n'
             '- **Location**: `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`\n'
             '- **Functionality**: The `skip` function allows tests to be skipped during execution with a specified message. It has an optional parameter '
             '`allow_module_level` which, when set to `True`, enables the function to be called at the module level, effectively skipping the rest of the '
             'module.\n'
             "- **Usage Note**: The documentation within the code advises that it's generally better to use the `pytest.mark.skipif` marker for conditionally "
             'skipping tests based on certain conditions (e.g., platform or dependency mismatches). It also mentions the use of `# doctest: +SKIP` for '
             'statically skipping doctests.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Usage of `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip`\n'
             '- **Occurrences**: Found in 4 snippets across 2 files (`testing/test_mark.py` and `testing/test_skipping.py`).\n'
             '- **Context**: This usage pattern is recommended for skipping entire modules but, as reported in the issue, fails to prevent the processing of '
             'the file which leads to syntax errors when encountering Python 3.8 specific syntax in environments with Python versions older than 3.8.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Analysis\n'
             'The issue at hand is twofold:\n'
             '1. **Documentation and Guidance**: The error message encountered when trying to use `skip` outside of a test suggests using `pytest.mark.skip` '
             'or `pytest.mark.skipif` at the module level. However, this advice does not account for scenarios where Python syntax incompatibilities prevent '
             'the file from being processed correctly in the first place. The documentation and error messages could be improved to address this specific use '
             'case more clearly.\n'
             '2. **Functionality Gap**: There seems to be a functionality gap for cleanly skipping modules that contain syntax or features not supported by '
             "the runtime Python version. While `allow_module_level=True` in the `skip` function provides a workaround, it's not prominently featured in "
             'guidance, and there might be a need for a more intuitive API or mechanism for this purpose.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Next Steps\n'
             'Given the analysis, the next steps could involve:\n'
             '- Proposing enhancements to the documentation to include guidance on using `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` for scenarios involving syntax '
             'incompatibilities.\n'

             '\n'
             '### `skip` Function Implementation\n'
             '- **Location**: `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`\n'
             '- **Functionality**: The `skip` function allows tests to be skipped during execution with a specified message. It has an optional parameter '
             '`allow_module_level` which, when set to `True`, enables the function to be called at the module level, effectively skipping the rest of the '
             'module.\n'
             "- **Usage Note**: The documentation within the code advises that it's generally better to use the `pytest.mark.skipif` marker for conditionally "
             'skipping tests based on certain conditions (e.g., platform or dependency mismatches). It also mentions the use of `# doctest: +SKIP` for '
             'statically skipping doctests.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Usage of `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip`\n'
             '- **Occurrences**: Found in 4 snippets across 2 files (`testing/test_mark.py` and `testing/test_skipping.py`).\n'
             '- **Context**: This usage pattern is recommended for skipping entire modules but, as reported in the issue, fails to prevent the processing of '
             'the file which leads to syntax errors when encountering Python 3.8 specific syntax in environments with Python versions older than 3.8.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Analysis\n'
             'The issue at hand is twofold:\n'
             '1. **Documentation and Guidance**: The error message encountered when trying to use `skip` outside of a test suggests using `pytest.mark.skip` '
             'or `pytest.mark.skipif` at the module level. However, this advice does not account for scenarios where Python syntax incompatibilities prevent '
             'the file from being processed correctly in the first place. The documentation and error messages could be improved to address this specific use '
             'case more clearly.\n'
             '2. **Functionality Gap**: There seems to be a functionality gap for cleanly skipping modules that contain syntax or features not supported by '
             "the runtime Python version. While `allow_module_level=True` in the `skip` function provides a workaround, it's not prominently featured in "
             'guidance, and there might be a need for a more intuitive API or mechanism for this purpose.\n'
             '\n'
             '### Next Steps\n'
             'Given the analysis, the next steps could involve:\n'
             '- Proposing enhancements to the documentation to include guidance on using `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` for scenarios involving syntax '
             'incompatibilities.\n'
             '- Considering the development of a new API or enhancing existing mechanisms to more gracefully handle module-level skipping in cases of Python '
