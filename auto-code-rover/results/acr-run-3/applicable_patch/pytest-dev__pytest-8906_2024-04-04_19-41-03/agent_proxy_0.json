Given the details in the issue, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"skip\")`: This will help in understanding how the `skip` function is currently implemented across the project, which is crucial for proposing a new API or improving the existing one.\n\n2. `search_code(\"pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip\")`: Since the issue mentions that the proposed solution using `pytestmark` does not work as expected, searching for its usage will provide insights into how module-level skipping is currently being handled and why it might be failing in this specific scenario.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the current state of test skipping functionality and how it can be improved."
