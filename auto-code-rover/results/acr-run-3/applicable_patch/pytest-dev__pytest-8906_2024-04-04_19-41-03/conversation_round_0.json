        "content": "<issue>Improve handling of skip for module level\nThis is potentially about updating docs, updating error messages or introducing a new API.\nConsider the following scenario:\n`pos_only.py` is using Python 3,8 syntax:\n```python\ndef foo(a, /, b):\nreturn a + b\n```\nIt should not be tested under Python 3.6 and 3.7.\nThis is a proper way to skip the test in Python older than 3.8:\n```python\nfrom pytest import raises, skip\nimport sys\nif sys.version_info < (3, 8):\nskip(msg=\"Requires Python >= 3.8\", allow_module_level=True)\n# import must be after the module level skip:\nfrom pos_only import *\ndef test_foo():\nassert foo(10, 20) == 30\nassert foo(10, b=20) == 30\nwith raises(TypeError):\nassert foo(a=10, b=20)\n```\nMy actual test involves parameterize and a 3.8 only class, so skipping the test itself is not sufficient because the 3.8 class was used in the parameterization.\nA naive user will try to initially skip the module like:\n```python\nif sys.version_info < (3, 8):\nskip(msg=\"Requires Python >= 3.8\")\n```\nThis issues this error:\n>Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.\nThe proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).\nThe correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.\nThis area feels a bit unpolished.\nA few ideas to improve:\n1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.\n2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module(\"reason\")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.\n</issue>"
