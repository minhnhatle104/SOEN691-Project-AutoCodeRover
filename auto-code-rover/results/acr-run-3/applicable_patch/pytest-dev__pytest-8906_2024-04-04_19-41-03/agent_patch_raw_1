<original>"""Skip an executing test with the given message.

    This function should be called only during testing (setup, call or teardown) or
    during collection by using the ``allow_module_level`` flag.  This function can
    be called in doctests as well.

    :param bool allow_module_level:
        Allows this function to be called at module level, skipping the rest
        of the module. Defaults to False.

    .. note::
        It is better to use the :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref` marker when
        possible to declare a test to be skipped under certain conditions
        like mismatching platforms or dependencies.
        Similarly, use the ``# doctest: +SKIP`` directive (see `doctest.SKIP
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/how-to/doctest.html#doctest.SKIP>`_)
        to skip a doctest statically.

    .. warning::
        If you encounter an error suggesting the use of `pytest.mark.skip` or `pytest.mark.skipif` for module-level skipping and your module contains syntax or features not supported by the current Python version, consider using `skip` with `allow_module_level=True`. This allows you to skip the entire module execution before encountering syntax errors. Example:
        
        ```python
        from _pytest.outcomes import skip
        import sys
        
        if sys.version_info < (3, 8):
            skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)
        ```
        
        This approach is particularly useful for modules that use newer Python syntax or features not available in earlier Python versions.
