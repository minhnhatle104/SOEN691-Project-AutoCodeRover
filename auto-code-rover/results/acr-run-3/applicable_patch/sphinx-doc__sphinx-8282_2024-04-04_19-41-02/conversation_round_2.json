Specifically, we are interested in how the setting `autodoc_typehints = 'none'` is supposed to suppress type hints in the documentation but fails to do so for overloaded functions. The relevant code snippets provided in the issue are from `conf.py`, `index.rst`, and `example.py`, with a focus on the handling of overloaded functions using the `typing.overload` decorator.\n\nGiven this context, we should look into the implementation of the `autodoc` extension, particularly how it processes the `autodoc_typehints` setting and overloaded functions. Here are the API calls that could provide valuable insights:\n\n1. **Search for the `autodoc` extension implementation**: This will help us understand how `autodoc_typehints` is processed.\n   - `search_code(\"autodoc_typehints\")`: This will help identify where and how the `autodoc_typehints` setting is read and applied within the Sphinx `autodoc` extension.\n\n2. **Search for how overloaded functions are handled**: Since the issue specifically mentions that overloaded callables do not respect the `autodoc_typehints` setting, we need to understand how these are processed.\n   - `search_code(\"@overload\")`: This will help identify how Sphinx or the `autodoc` extension processes overloaded functions.\n\n3. **Search for the documentation generation process**: Understanding how Sphinx generates documentation for functions might reveal why overloaded functions are treated differently.\n   - `search_method(\"generate_documentation\")`: This is a hypothetical search to find methods that might be responsible for generating documentation, which could reveal how type hints are included or excluded.\n\nThese searches aim to gather enough context about how the `autodoc_typehints` setting is supposed to work, how overloaded functions are documented by Sphinx, and potentially why there's a discrepancy in the expected behavior."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered some context about how `autodoc_typehints` is handled within the Sphinx codebase and how overloaded functions are tested. Here's an analysis of the findings:\n\n1. **`autodoc_typehints` in the codebase**:\n   - The setting `autodoc_typehints` appears in multiple files, notably in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. This suggests that the handling of type hints, including the processing of the `autodoc_typehints` setting, is primarily managed within these files. The presence in `__init__.py` indicates that it might be part of the core logic for the `autodoc` extension, while `typehints.py` likely contains the specific logic for parsing and applying type hint settings.\n\n2. **Handling of `@overload`**:\n   - The search results for `@overload` are limited to tests, specifically within `tests/test_pycode_parser.py`. This indicates that the Sphinx project includes tests for parsing overloaded functions, but it doesn't directly point us to the implementation logic for how overloaded functions are documented. However, the presence of these tests suggests that Sphinx is aware of and has some handling for overloaded functions, at least at the parsing level.\n\n3. **Lack of `generate_documentation` method**:\n   - The search for a method named `generate_documentation` did not yield results, which suggests that the documentation generation process is either named differently or is spread across multiple methods and components within the Sphinx codebase. This means we might need to look into the documentation generation process using different search terms or by analyzing the files identified in the first two search results.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve diving deeper into the files identified (`sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`) to understand how `autodoc_typehints` is applied and to see if there's a specific reason why overloaded functions are not respecting this setting. Additionally, understanding the general architecture of how Sphinx generates documentation from the source code could also provide insights into where the issue might be arising.\n\nTo proceed, we should consider examining the relevant sections of the identified files to understand how type hints are processed and how overloaded functions are documented. This could involve looking at the implementation details within `typehints.py` and `__init__.py` to find clues about the discrepancy reported in the issue."

        "content": "The search results provide specific insights into how `autodoc_typehints` is handled within the Sphinx `autodoc` extension, particularly within `typehints.py` and `__init__.py`. However, there is no direct evidence of how overloaded functions are specifically handled in relation to `autodoc_typehints`. Here's a detailed analysis of the findings:\n\n1. **Handling of `autodoc_typehints` in `typehints.py`**:\n   - The function `merge_typehints` in `typehints.py` checks the `autodoc_typehints` setting but only in the context of whether it's set to `'description'`. This function seems to be part of the logic that merges or processes type hints, but it specifically returns early if `autodoc_typehints` is not set to `'description'`, indicating that its primary concern is not with the `'none'` setting, which is the focus of the reported issue.\n\n2. **Handling of `autodoc_typehints` in `__init__.py`**:\n   - In `__init__.py`, the `autodoc_typehints` setting is referenced in multiple places, particularly within the `format_args` method and during the `setup` process. This suggests that `__init__.py` contains core logic for how type hints are formatted and potentially how the `autodoc_typehints` setting is globally applied. However, without specific references to handling overloaded functions, it's unclear how or if this process differs for overloaded callables.\n\n3. **Lack of direct references to `@overload`**:\n   - The absence of direct references to handling the `@overload` decorator in both `typehints.py` and `__init__.py` suggests that the specific issue with overloaded functions not respecting the `autodoc_typehints = 'none'` setting might not be directly addressed in the code. This could imply that the handling of overloaded functions is either assumed to be covered by the general type hint processing logic or is overlooked.\n\nGiven this analysis, the bug likely lies in the general handling of type hints for overloaded functions, which seems not to differentiate or specifically address the nuances of overloaded callables when applying the `autodoc_typehints` setting. The absence of explicit handling for overloaded functions in relation to `autodoc_typehints` suggests a potential oversight or gap in the implementation.\n\n**Potential Bug Locations**:\n- The `merge_typehints` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` and the `format_args` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` are key areas related to type hint processing. While they may not directly reference overloaded functions, the logic within these areas could be missing necessary conditions or checks to properly apply the `autodoc_typehints = 'none'` setting to overloaded callables.\n- Since there's no direct handling of `@overload` found in the search results, the bug might not be in a specific \"buggy method\" but rather in the lack of specific handling or consideration for overloaded functions within the existing logic.\n\nTo address the issue, a patch might need to introduce explicit checks or logic to handle overloaded functions in accordance with the `autodoc_typehints` setting, ensuring that the documentation generation process respects this setting for all types of functions, including overloaded ones."
