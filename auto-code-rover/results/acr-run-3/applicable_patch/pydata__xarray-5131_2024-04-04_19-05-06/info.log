However, neither a `__str__` nor a `__repr__` method was found directly within the `DatasetGroupBy` class. This suggests a few possibilities for the source of the trailing whitespace issue in the text representation of `DatasetGroupBy` objects:\n\n1. **Inheritance**: Since `DatasetGroupBy` does not have its own `__str__` or `__repr__` methods, it might be inheriting the method responsible for its string representation from a parent class. The class definition indicates that `DatasetGroupBy` inherits from `GroupBy` and `ImplementsDatasetReduce`. The string representation could be defined in one of these parent classes or further up the inheritance chain.\n\n2. **Dynamically Generated Representation**: The text representation could be generated dynamically in a method other than `__str__` or `__repr__`, possibly through a method that is called within these or as part of a more complex string formatting or output mechanism.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the next steps in the investigation should focus on exploring the parent classes for potential sources of the string representation method and looking for any dynamic generation mechanisms that might involve the text representation of `DatasetGroupBy` objects.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n1. Search for the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in the `GroupBy` class, as it is directly mentioned as a parent class of `DatasetGroupBy`.\n2. If the above step does not yield results, consider searching for any methods in `DatasetGroupBy` and its parent classes that might be responsible for generating the text representation dynamically.\n\nLet\'s start with the first step:\n- `search_method_in_class("__str__", "GroupBy")`\n- `search_method_in_class("__repr__", "GroupBy")`\n\nThis will help us determine if the parent class `GroupBy` is where the string representation is defined.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
