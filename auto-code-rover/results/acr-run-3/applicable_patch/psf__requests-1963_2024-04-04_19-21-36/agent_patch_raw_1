# modification 2
```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>            method = req.method</original>
<patched>            # Use the method from the prepared_request which might have been updated
            # due to a 303 redirect in a previous iteration
            method = prepared_request.method</patched>
```

Explanation:
- **Modification 1**: This patch addresses the issue where the original request object is copied for each redirect, causing the method to revert to POST after a 303 See Other response has changed it to GET. By checking if the previous response was a 303 See Other and using the method from the last response's request if so, we ensure that the method change is preserved across subsequent redirects.
  
- **Modification 2**: Ensures that the method used for preparing the next request in the redirection chain is taken from the `prepared_request`, which might have been updated in the previous iteration of the loop. This change is necessary to ensure that the method change made in modification 1 is correctly applied to the next request in the chain.
