This patch modifies the `_delete_composed_index` method in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` to allow for the deletion of multiple constraints that match the criteria, rather than raising a `ValueError` when more than one constraint is found. This approach specifically addresses the issue where `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints overlap on the same fields, by iterating over all found constraint names and deleting each one, instead of expecting only a single constraint to match. This change should resolve the migration crash when attempting to delete an `index_together` that overlaps with a `unique_together` constraint.
