Given the information and the context provided, it's clear that the issue lies in how the `sqf_list` functions handle and represent the multiplicities of factors. However, without a specific error in the logic being pointed out or a clear indication of what part of the code is causing the inconsistency as described in the issue, it's challenging to provide an exact patch.

Nonetheless, based on the general nature of the issue described, a hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that the multiplicities of factors are correctly aggregated and represented in the output of both `sqf_list` functions. Since the exact cause of the inconsistency isn't pinpointed, I'll provide a conceptual patch that might address potential issues in handling multiplicities.

Please note, the following patches are speculative and intended to illustrate how one might begin to address the issue based on the information provided. Actual debugging and testing would be necessary to confirm the root cause and effectiveness of these changes.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/polys/polytools.py</file>
<original>return _generic_factor_list(f, gens, args, method='sqf')</original>
<patched># Ensure multiplicities are correctly aggregated
def aggregate_multiplicities(factors):
    aggregated = {}
    for base, exp in factors:
        if base in aggregated:
            aggregated[base] += exp
        else:
            aggregated[base] = exp
    return list(aggregated.items())

result = _generic_factor_list(f, gens, args, method='sqf')
# Assuming result is in the format (constant, [(factor, multiplicity), ...])
constant, factors = result
aggregated_factors = aggregate_multiplicities(factors)
return constant, aggregated_factors</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/polys/polytools.py</file>
<original>return f.rep.dom.to_sympy(coeff), [(f.per(g), k) for g, k in factors]</original>
<patched># Ensure multiplicities are correctly aggregated
def aggregate_multiplicities(factors):
    aggregated = {}
    for base, exp in factors:
        if base in aggregated:
            aggregated[base] += exp
        else:
            aggregated[base] = exp
    return [(f.per(g), k) for g, k in aggregated.items()]

coeff, factors = f.rep.dom.to_sympy(coeff), [(f.per(g), k) for g, k in factors]
aggregated_factors = aggregate_multiplicities(factors)
return coeff, aggregated_factors</patched>
```

These modifications introduce a hypothetical `aggregate_multiplicities` function designed to ensure that factors with the same base are not listed separately with their multiplicities but instead have their multiplicities summed up. This approach assumes that the issue lies in the representation of the output rather than the factorization logic itself. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific data structures and types used in the `sqf_list` functions and the `_generic_factor_list` method.
