The issue mentions that the output of `sqf_list` is not consistent, particularly in handling the multiplicity of factors correctly. Given this information, the following API calls would be useful to start our investigation:\n\n1. `search_method(\"sqf\")`: This will help us understand how the `sqf` function is implemented and whether there are any obvious issues in its logic that could lead to inconsistent output.\n\n2. `search_method(\"sqf_list\")`: Since the issue specifically mentions `sqf_list`, we need to examine its implementation closely to identify any discrepancies in handling multiplicities of factors.\n\nThese initial searches should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the problem described in the issue."
