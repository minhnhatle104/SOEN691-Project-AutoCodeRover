        "content": "Based on the issue description and the information gathered from the `ccode` method in `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, the issue revolves around the inability of the `ccode` function to directly translate the `sinc` function into C code. The `sinc` function, which is defined as \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\) for \\(x \\neq 0\\) and \\(1\\) for \\(x = 0\\), does not have a direct equivalent in the C standard library (`math.h`), and thus, `ccode` does not support it natively.\n\nThe `ccode` function is designed to convert SymPy expressions into their C code equivalents. It supports a wide range of expressions, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, conditional expressions (via `Piecewise`), and even custom functions through the `user_functions` parameter. However, for expressions or functions that do not have a direct C equivalent or are not explicitly supported, `ccode` defaults to outputting a comment indicating the lack of support, as seen with `sinc(x)`.\n\nThe user's suggestion involves manually converting the `sinc` function into a `Piecewise` expression that SymPy's `ccode` can handle. This approach leverages the fact that `ccode` can translate `Piecewise` expressions into conditional statements in C. The suggested `Piecewise` expression for `sinc(x)` is:\n\n```python\nPiecewise((sin(theta)/theta, Ne(theta, 0)), (1, True))\n```\n\nThis expression correctly represents the mathematical definition of `sinc(x)` and is something that `ccode` can convert into a valid C conditional statement, as demonstrated by the user.\n\nTo address the issue, a patch would need to either:\n1. Enhance the `ccode` function to natively support the `sinc` function by internally converting it to the equivalent `Piecewise` expression before generating the C code.\n2. Document a recommended workaround for users, guiding them to manually convert `sinc` expressions to `Piecewise` expressions before passing them to `ccode`.\n\nThe first approach would provide a more seamless experience for users, automatically handling `sinc` expressions without requiring manual intervention. This would involve modifying the `ccode` function or the `CCodePrinter` class to recognize `sinc` expressions and convert them appropriately."
