This patch introduces a check before the `ccode` function returns its output. If the expression is identified as a `sinc` function, it is converted into a `Piecewise` expression that represents the mathematical definition of `sinc(x)`. This `Piecewise` expression is then passed to the `CCodePrinter` for conversion into C code. This approach allows `ccode` to support the `sinc` function indirectly by leveraging its existing capability to handle `Piecewise` expressions.
