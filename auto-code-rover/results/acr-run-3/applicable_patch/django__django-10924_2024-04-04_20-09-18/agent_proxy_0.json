Since the issue revolves around making the `path` attribute of `FilePathField` accept a callable, we should start by looking into the `FilePathField` class and any relevant methods that deal with the `path` attribute. \n\nGiven the context, the following API calls would be beneficial to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"FilePathField\")`: This will help us understand the implementation details of `FilePathField`, including how the `path` attribute is currently handled.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"deconstruct\", \"FilePathField\")`: Since the issue mentions manual changes in migrations, it's important to see how `FilePathField` is deconstructed for migrations. The `deconstruct` method is responsible for providing the necessary information to generate migration files.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"FilePathField\")`: The constructor of `FilePathField` might contain logic for handling the `path` parameter, which could be crucial for implementing the ability to accept a callable.\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the current implementation and identifying where modifications are needed to support a callable for the `path` attribute."
