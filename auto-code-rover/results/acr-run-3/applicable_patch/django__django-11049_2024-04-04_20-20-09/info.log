The issue described pertains to the error message format and possibly adding help text, which is more likely to be relevant to the `DurationField` class found in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, as it directly deals with database model fields and their validation.\n\n2. **Error Message**:\n   - The incorrect error message is defined in the `DurationField` class within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The current message suggests a format of `[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]`, which, according to the issue description, inaccurately represents the required format. The correct format should emphasize that seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided.\n\n3. **Validation Methods**:\n   - The search for methods named `clean` and `validate` within the `DurationField` class did not yield any results. This suggests that the validation and error messaging might be handled through other mechanisms or inherited methods within the `DurationField` class or its parent classes. The `to_python` method, which is present in both `DurationField` class definitions, is likely involved in the validation and conversion process.\n\n4. **Current Error Message Location**:\n   - The specific error message is located in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. This is the exact location where the incorrect format is specified, and thus, where the correction needs to be made.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve:\n- Correcting the error message in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` to accurately reflect the required format.\n- Considering the addition of default `help_text` to the `DurationField` to make the syntax more self-explanatory for users.
