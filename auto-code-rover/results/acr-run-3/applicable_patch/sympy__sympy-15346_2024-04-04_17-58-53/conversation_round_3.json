This indicates that the `simplify` method is widely used across different contexts in the codebase, suggesting it has a generic implementation in `sympy/core/expr.py` that might be overridden or extended in specific contexts.\n\n2. **Matrix Class**: The search did not find a class named `Matrix` directly. This could mean that the class is either dynamically defined, aliased under a different name, or part of a module that wasn't directly searchable with the provided API call. Given that matrices are a fundamental part of SymPy, it's likely that the functionality exists but might require a more specific approach to locate.\n\n3. **Dot Method in Matrix Class**: Since the `Matrix` class was not found, the search for the `dot` method within it also yielded no results. This suggests a need to refine the search strategy, possibly by looking into how matrix operations are generally implemented in SymPy or by searching for alternative names or modules that handle matrix operations.\n\nGiven these points, the issue at hand seems to revolve around the `simplify` method's behavior when applied to expressions involving trigonometric functions of rational numbers, particularly within the context of matrix operations. The absence of direct information on the `Matrix` class and its `dot` method suggests that further investigation is needed, possibly by examining the files related to matrices (`sympy/matrices/common.py` and `sympy/matrices/dense.py`) and the core simplification logic (`sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`).\n\nTo proceed, we might need to:\n- Look into the implementation of the `simplify` method in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` to understand how it works with trigonometric and rational expressions.\n- Investigate how matrices are handled in SymPy, given the absence of direct information from the search results.

If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n\n    If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n    x belongs to the set where this relation is true.

        "content": "The collected context from the search results provides valuable insights into how the `simplify` method is implemented and where potential issues might arise in the context of the reported bug. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n### `simplify` Method in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`\n- The `simplify` function is quite comprehensive and attempts to apply a variety of simplification strategies to the given expression. It's designed to handle a wide range of cases, including trigonometric functions, rational expressions, and more.\n- The method accepts several parameters that influence its behavior, such as `ratio`, `measure`, `rational`, and `inverse`. These parameters allow for customization of the simplification process, potentially affecting the outcome for expressions involving trigonometric functions of rational numbers.\n- The function attempts to rationalize floats if `rational` is not set to `False`, applies various simplification strategies (e.g., `trigsimp`, `powsimp`, `cancel`, `factor_terms`), and even has specific handling for expressions involving logarithms, gamma functions, sums, and products.\n- Notably, the function uses a measure function (default: `count_ops`) to decide whether the simplified expression is \"simpler\" than the original. This decision-making process could be where the issue lies, especially if the simplification of trigonometric functions involving rational numbers doesn't meet the expected \"simpler\" criteria.\n\n### `simplify` Method in `sympy/core/expr.py`\n- This method is essentially a wrapper that calls the `simplify` function from `sympy.simplify.simplify.py`. It confirms that the `simplify` method is accessible from any expression object, which is consistent with the user's attempt to simplify expressions involving trigonometric functions of rational numbers.\n\n### Analysis and Potential Bug Locations\nGiven the complexity of the `simplify` function and its reliance on a variety of strategies and heuristics, the issue could stem from several areas:\n- **Rationalization of Floats**: If the expressions involving `sin` and `cos` of rational numbers are not being simplified as expected, it could be related to how these rational numbers are handled. The `rational` parameter's behavior might need to be examined in the context of trigonometric functions.\n- **Simplification Strategies**: The specific strategies applied to trigonometric functions (e.g., `trigsimp`) might not be effectively simplifying expressions involving rational numbers, or the heuristic measure (e.g., `count_ops`) might not recognize the simplified form as being \"simpler.\"\n- **Heuristic Measure**: The decision-making process based on the `measure` function could be another area where the expected simplification does not occur because the simplified expression is not deemed \"simpler\" according to the heuristic used.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the exact location of the bug is not explicitly clear from the context, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is a prime candidate for further investigation. Specifically, examining how trigonometric expressions involving rational numbers are simplified and how the \"simpler\" criterion is evaluated could provide insights into the reported issue."

For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n\n    If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n    x belongs to the set where this relation is true. The default is\n    False.\n    \"\"\"\n    expr = sympify(expr)\n\n    try:\n        return expr._eval_simplify(ratio=ratio, measure=measure, rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n    except AttributeError:\n        pass\n\n    original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n\n    from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n    from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n    from sympy import Sum, Product\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n        return expr\n\n    if inverse and expr.has(Function):\n        expr = inversecombine(expr)\n        if not expr.args:  # simplified to atomic\n            return expr\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n        return expr.func(*[simplify(x, ratio=ratio, measure=measure, rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n                         for x in expr.args])\n\n    if not expr.is_commutative:\n        expr = nc_simplify(expr)\n\n    # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n    # is it a purely rational function?
