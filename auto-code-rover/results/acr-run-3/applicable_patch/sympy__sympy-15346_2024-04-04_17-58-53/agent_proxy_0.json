Search for the `Matrix` class to understand how matrices are implemented and how operations like dot products are handled, especially when the matrix elements are trigonometric functions of rational numbers.\n3. Search for the `dot` method within the `Matrix` class to understand its implementation details, which could reveal why the simplification isn't occurring as expected.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"simplify\")\nsearch_class(\"Matrix\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"dot\", \"Matrix\")\n```"
