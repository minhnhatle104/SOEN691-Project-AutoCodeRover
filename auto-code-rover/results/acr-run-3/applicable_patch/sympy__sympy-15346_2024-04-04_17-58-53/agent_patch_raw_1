Given the complexity of the `simplify` function and without a clear indication of a specific bug from the provided context, a precise patch cannot be provided. However, I can suggest a general enhancement to the `simplify` function that might improve its handling of trigonometric expressions involving rational numbers. This enhancement involves ensuring that trigonometric functions with rational arguments are more aggressively simplified, possibly by enhancing the `trigsimp` call within the `simplify` function.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>if expr.has(TrigonometricFunction, HyperbolicFunction):
    expr = trigsimp(expr, deep=True)</original>
<patched>if expr.has(TrigonometricFunction, HyperbolicFunction):
    # Enhanced trigonometric simplification with method='fu' for better handling of rational numbers
    expr = trigsimp(expr, method='fu', deep=True)</patched>
```

This modification suggests using a specific method (`'fu'`) within the `trigsimp` call. The `'fu'` method applies a set of trigonometric identities that can simplify expressions more aggressively, which might be beneficial for expressions involving rational numbers. Note that this is a heuristic improvement and might not address all underlying issues related to the simplification of trigonometric expressions with rational arguments. Further analysis and testing would be required to ensure that this change does not introduce regressions or adversely affect the simplification of other types of expressions.
