We also need to understand how `__radd__` is currently being handled or if it's indeed missing. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SimpleLazyObject\")`: This will help us understand the current implementation of the `SimpleLazyObject` class, including any magic methods it currently implements.\n\n2. `search_method(\"new_method_proxy\")`: Since the issue description mentions an attempt to use `new_method_proxy` for implementing `__radd__`, understanding this method's current implementation and usage is crucial.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__radd__\", \"SimpleLazyObject\")`: This will help us confirm whether `__radd__` is indeed not implemented in `SimpleLazyObject` and provide context on how other magic methods are implemented within this class."
