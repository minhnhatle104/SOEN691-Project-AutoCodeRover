Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Poly3DCollection\")`: This will help me understand the structure of the `Poly3DCollection` class, including its inheritance and any relevant attributes or methods that might be related to the issue.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get_facecolors\", \"Poly3DCollection\")`: Since the error occurs when calling `get_facecolors`, I need to see the implementation of this method within the `Poly3DCollection` class to understand why it's trying to access an attribute `_facecolors2d` that doesn't exist.\n\n3. `search_code(\"_facecolors2d\")`: This will help me find any part of the code where `_facecolors2d` is being set or used, which might give me clues on why it's missing or how it's supposed to be initialized."
