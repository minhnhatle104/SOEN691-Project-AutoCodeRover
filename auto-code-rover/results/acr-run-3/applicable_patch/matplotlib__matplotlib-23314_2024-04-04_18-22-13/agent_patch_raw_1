This modification adds a check at the beginning of the `draw` method in the `Axes3D` class to immediately return if the `Axes3D` object is not visible (`self.get_visible()` returns `False`). This change ensures that the entire rendering process is skipped for `Axes3D` objects that have been set to invisible, aligning with the expected behavior of the `set_visible` method.
