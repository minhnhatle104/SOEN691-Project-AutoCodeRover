        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how Django processes the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting and how it checks against the `LANGUAGES` setting to raise the `translation.E004` error. The description suggests that the error occurs during system checks, specifically when a sublanguage code is used in `LANGUAGE_CODE` without its base language explicitly listed in the `LANGUAGES` setting, even though Django documentation states that it should fall back to the base language if available.\n\nGiven this, we should look into the Django system checks related to translations and settings to see how `LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES` are validated. We need to find the implementation of the system check that raises `translation.E004` and see if there's a mechanism to validate sublanguages against their base languages.\n\nLet's perform the following searches to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for the system check that raises `translation.E004`. This might be part of Django's system checks framework, possibly related to settings or translations.\n2. Search for how Django handles `LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES` settings, especially in relation to sublanguages and base languages.\n\nBased on the above, here are the API calls we will make:\n\n- `search_code(\"translation.E004\")`: This will help us find where the `translation.E004` error is defined and possibly the check that raises this error.\n- `search_method(\"check_language_code\")`: Assuming there might be a method responsible for validating the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting, this search will help us find such a method. The name `check_language_code` is hypothetical and represents the type of method we're looking for.\n- `search_code(\"LANGUAGE_CODE\")`: This will help us find references to the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting in the codebase, which might lead us to the relevant validation logic.\n- `search_code(\"LANGUAGES\")`: Similarly, this will help us find references to the `LANGUAGES` setting, which is likely involved in the validation process for `LANGUAGE_CODE`."

        "content": "Analyzing the information gathered from the search results, we can draw several insights relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Location of `translation.E004` Error Definition and Usage**:\n   - The error `translation.E004` is defined in `django/core/checks/translation.py`. The error message explicitly states the issue is about the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting not being in the `LANGUAGES` setting.\n   - The test case in `tests/check_framework/test_translation.py` under `TranslationCheckTests` class, specifically in the `test_inconsistent_language_settings` function, tests the scenario where `translation.E004` is expected to be raised. This indicates that the system check framework is indeed responsible for raising this error during Django's startup checks.\n\n2. **`LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES` Settings**:\n   - The `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting is referenced extensively across the codebase, including in middleware, template context processors, and various tests. This suggests that `LANGUAGE_CODE` plays a significant role in Django's internationalization (i18n) framework.\n   - The `LANGUAGES` setting also has widespread references, notably in the same `django/core/checks/translation.py` file where `translation.E004` is defined. This implies that the validation logic for `LANGUAGE_CODE` against `LANGUAGES` is likely contained within this area.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n\n1. **Reviewing the Validation Logic**:\n   - Examine the validation logic in `django/core/checks/translation.py` to understand how Django checks if the `LANGUAGE_CODE` is present in the `LANGUAGES` setting. This will help identify why sublanguages are not being correctly validated against their base languages.\n\n2. **Understanding Sublanguage Handling**:\n   - Since Django documentation states that it should fall back to the base language if a sublanguage is not available, it's crucial to understand how Django currently handles sublanguages. This involves looking into how `LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES` are processed in the internationalization framework, possibly in files like `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py`.\n\n3. **Identifying the Gap**:\n   - The core of the issue seems to be a gap in the validation logic where sublanguages are not recognized as valid when their base language is present. Identifying where this gap occurs in the codebase is essential for developing a patch.\n\n4. **Developing a Patch**:\n   - The solution likely involves modifying the system check that raises `translation.E004` to allow sublanguages when their base language is available in the `LANGUAGES` setting. This might include adding logic to parse the `LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES` settings to properly handle sublanguages.\n\nTo proceed, we would need to closely examine the code in `django/core/checks/translation.py` and potentially `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py` to understand the current handling of languages and sublanguages and to develop a suitable patch."

        "content": "Based on the additional context provided by the search results, we can further refine our understanding of where and how the issue with `translation.E004` is being handled within Django's codebase. Here's a breakdown of the relevant findings:\n\n1. **`translation.E004` Error Definition**:\n   - The error message for `translation.E004` is exactly as described in the initial issue report, confirming its role in flagging inconsistencies between the `LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES` settings.\n\n2. **References to `LANGUAGE_CODE` in `django/core/checks/translation.py`**:\n   - The `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting is specifically checked in two methods: `check_setting_language_code` and `check_language_settings_consistent`. This indicates that these methods are directly involved in validating the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting and potentially where the issue might be located.\n\n3. **References to `LANGUAGES` in `django/core/checks/translation.py`**:\n   - The `LANGUAGES` setting is referenced in multiple methods: `check_setting_languages`, `check_setting_languages_bidi`, and `check_language_settings_consistent`. The presence of `LANGUAGES` in these checks suggests they are part of the validation process that ensures the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting is consistent with the available languages defined in `LANGUAGES`.\n\n4. **Bug Location and Potential Fix**:\n   - The method `check_language_settings_consistent` is the most likely location of the bug, as it is the common method that references both `LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES`. This method is responsible for ensuring consistency between these settings, which is directly related to the issue at hand.\n   - Given that `check_setting_language_code` also references `LANGUAGE_CODE`, it might play a role in the initial validation of the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting. However, the inconsistency issue described seems more closely related to how both `LANGUAGE_CODE` and `LANGUAGES` are compared, pointing towards `check_language_settings_consistent` as the primary location for the bug.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nThe issue likely stems from how the `check_language_settings_consistent` method validates the `LANGUAGE_CODE` against the `LANGUAGES` setting. The current logic might not account for the scenario where a sublanguage is specified in `LANGUAGE_CODE` but only its base language is available in `LANGUAGES`. To resolve the issue, the validation logic in `check_language_settings_consistent` needs to be enhanced to recognize and allow sublanguages when their base language is present in `LANGUAGES`.\n\n**Next Steps**:\nA detailed review of the `check_language_settings_consistent` method's implementation is necessary to understand its current logic for validating `LANGUAGE_CODE` against `LANGUAGES`. The goal would be to identify the exact point where the logic fails to account for sublanguages and to develop a patch that allows for the fallback behavior described in Django's documentation. This would involve modifying the validation to parse and compare the base language of the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting against the languages listed in `LANGUAGES` to correctly handle sublanguages."
