Given the context and the issue described, the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the documentation generated by Sphinx's autodoc seems to stem from how these special parameters are handled during the documentation generation process. Unfortunately, without a clear indication of a specific bug in the provided code snippets, it's challenging to propose a precise patch. However, I can suggest a general approach that might be taken to address issues like this, focusing on ensuring `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled uniquely and not duplicated.

Since the issue describes a problem with the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the generated documentation, and the provided code snippets do not directly show where this duplication occurs, the patch would need to focus on ensuring that these parameters are documented correctly without duplication. This might involve checking for existing documentation of these parameters before adding them again or ensuring that the logic that adds these parameters to the documentation is only triggered once.

As a hypothetical example, if the duplication were happening because `*args` and `**kwargs` were being added to the documentation in both `record_typehints` and `merge_typehints` methods without checking if they were already documented, a patch might look like this:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py</file>
<original>annotation[param.name] = typing.stringify(param.annotation, mode)</original>
<patched>if param.name not in annotation:
    annotation[param.name] = typing.stringify(param.annotation, mode)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py</file>
<original>annotation['return'] = typing.stringify(sig.return_annotation, mode)</original>
<patched>if 'return' not in annotation:
    annotation['return'] = typing.stringify(sig.return_annotation, mode)</patched>
```

Please note, these modifications are speculative and based on a hypothetical understanding of the issue. The actual issue might be more complex and require a deeper understanding of the Sphinx autodoc extension's internals. A real fix would likely require a detailed review of how `*args` and `**kwargs` are processed and added to the documentation across the entire autodoc extension, ensuring that they are handled correctly at each step of the documentation generation process.
