The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    \"\"\"\n    is_sympy = getattr(a, '__sympy__', None)\n    if is_sympy is not None:\n        return a\n\n    if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n    cls = getattr(a, \"__class__\", None)\n    if cls is None:\n        cls = type(a)  # Probably an old-style class\n    conv = converter.get(cls, None)\n    if conv is not None:\n        return conv(a)\n\n    for superclass in getmro(cls):\n        try:\n            return converter[superclass](a)\n        except KeyError:\n            continue\n\n    if cls is type(None):\n        if strict:\n            raise SympifyError(a)\n        else:\n            return a\n\n    if evaluate is None:\n        if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n            evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n        else:\n            evaluate = True\n\n    # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n    # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n    if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n        import numpy as np\n        if np.isscalar(a):\n            return _convert_numpy_types(a, locals=locals,\n                convert_xor=convert_xor, strict=strict, rational=rational,\n                evaluate=evaluate)\n\n    _sympy_ = getattr(a, \"_sympy_\", None)\n    if _sympy_ is not None:\n        try:\n            return a._sympy_()\n        # XXX: Catches AttributeError: 'SympyConverter' object has no\n        # attribute 'tuple'\n        # This is probably a bug somewhere but for now we catch it here.\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n\n    if not strict:\n        # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n        # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n        flat = getattr(a, \"flat\", None)\n        if flat is not None:\n            shape = getattr(a, \"shape\", None)\n            if shape is not None:\n                from ..tensor.array import Array\n                return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n\n    if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n        for coerce in (float, int):\n            try:\n                coerced = coerce(a)\n            except (TypeError, ValueError):\n                continue\n            # XXX: AttributeError only needed here for Py2\n            except AttributeError:\n                continue\n            try:\n                return sympify(coerced)\n            except SympifyError:\n                continue\n\n    if strict:\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    if iterable(a):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n    if isinstance(a, dict):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n\n    # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n    # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n    # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n    # anything to SymPy expression).\n    #\n    # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n    # and try to parse it.

        "content": "Based on the information collected from the `Point` class, its `__add__` method, and the `sympify` function, let's analyze the context to understand the root cause of the issue and how we might address it.\n\n### Analysis of the `Point` Class and `__add__` Method\n\nThe `Point` class in `sympy/geometry/point.py` is designed to represent points in a geometric space. The `__add__` method of the `Point` class allows for the addition of two `Point` objects or a `Point` object with a sequence of coordinates. The method attempts to normalize the dimensions of the operands and then perform coordinate-wise addition. If the operands cannot be normalized due to a type mismatch, a `TypeError` is raised, which is then caught, and a `GeometryError` is raised with a message indicating that the operation is not supported.\n\n### Analysis of the `sympify` Function\n\nThe `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is designed to convert an arbitrary expression into a type that can be used inside SymPy. It supports converting Python numeric types, strings, booleans, and collections of these into SymPy types. When `sympify` is applied to a numeric value, it converts it into an instance of `sympy.Integer` or `sympy.Float`, depending on whether the input is an integer or a floating-point number, respectively.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\nThe issue arises when attempting to multiply a `Point` object by a number that has been processed by `sympify`, and then adding it to another `Point` object. The first operation, `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`, works fine because the multiplication `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` is performed first, resulting in a `Point` object that can be added to `point1`. However, in the second operation, `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`, the attempt to add `point1` and `sympy.sympify(2.0)` together fails because the `__add__` method does not support adding a `Point` object to the result of `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` directly, due to the way operands are processed and type-checked.\n\n### Potential Solutions\n\nTo resolve this issue, we might consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Enhance the `__add__` Method**: Modify the `__add__` method of the `Point` class to better handle cases where one of the operands is the result of a multiplication involving a `Point` object and a `sympy` number. This could involve adding logic to detect and correctly handle such cases.\n\n2. **Improve Operand Handling**: Investigate if there's a way to ensure that operations involving `Point` objects and numbers processed by `sympify` are always performed in a manner that produces a compatible type for addition with another `Point` object.\n\n3. **Documentation and Best Practices**: If the issue cannot be resolved in a manner that allows for intuitive operation ordering, consider updating the documentation to highlight the correct way to perform operations involving `Point` objects and `sympify`-processed numbers, as well as explaining the reason behind it.\n\nThe next step would be to decide on the most appropriate solution and implement the necessary changes in the codebase."
