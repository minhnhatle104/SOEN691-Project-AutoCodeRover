Given the complexity of the issue and the need for a careful approach to avoid unintended consequences in Django's ORM behavior, a direct patch is challenging to propose without a deeper dive into the framework's internals. However, I'll provide a hypothetical approach to illustrate how one might begin to address the issue described, focusing on ensuring that the `GROUP BY` clause is correctly preserved through queryset operations.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and may not be directly applicable without further testing and validation within the Django framework.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>if clone._fields is None:
    clone.query.group_by = True
else:
    clone.query.set_group_by()</original>
<patched># Hypothetical patch to ensure GROUP BY fields are preserved after filtering
# This is a conceptual approach and needs thorough testing.
if clone._fields is None:
    clone.query.group_by = True
else:
    clone.query.set_group_by()
# Ensure GROUP BY fields from the initial values() call are preserved
if hasattr(clone, '_initial_group_by'):
    clone.query.group_by += clone._initial_group_by</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>clone = self._chain()</original>
<patched>clone = self._chain()
# Conceptually preserving initial GROUP BY fields for later use
if self.query.group_by:
    clone._initial_group_by = self.query.group_by</patched>
```

This conceptual patch introduces the idea of preserving the initial `GROUP BY` fields through the queryset's lifecycle, particularly after operations that could potentially alter its state, such as `filter()` and `values()`. The first modification attempts to ensure that any initial `GROUP BY` fields are re-applied to the query if they were somehow lost or overridden in subsequent operations. The second modification suggests capturing and preserving these initial `GROUP BY` fields when cloning the queryset.

It's important to emphasize that changes to Django's ORM, especially those related to query construction and execution, require extensive testing to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions. This hypothetical patch is intended to illustrate a potential direction for further investigation and development by those familiar with Django's internals and its query processing mechanisms.
