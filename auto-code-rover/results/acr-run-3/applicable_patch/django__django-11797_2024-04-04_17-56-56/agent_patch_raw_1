Given the issue description and the code snippets provided, the problem seems to be related to how the `GROUP BY` clause is determined and applied in the context of filtering on the result of an annotated queryset. The issue arises when the final query does not preserve the intended `GROUP BY` behavior, specifically when filtering on the result of an annotated queryset that uses `values()` before and after the `annotate()` call.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause is correctly applied based on the fields specified in the initial `values()` call, even after subsequent queryset operations like `filter()`. However, without a clear indication of a specific bug in the provided code snippets and without modifying Django's core behavior in a way that could affect other parts of the framework or existing applications, proposing a precise patch is challenging.

A general approach to solving this issue could involve ensuring that the queryset's `group_by` attribute is correctly set and preserved through queryset operations. This might involve adjustments in how `annotate()` and subsequent methods like `filter()` and `values()` handle the `group_by` state. However, without a deeper dive into the internal mechanics of Django's queryset operations and how they interact with each other, it's difficult to provide a specific code patch.

Given these constraints, I recommend further investigation into the queryset's lifecycle, specifically how `group_by` is managed across chained operations. This would likely involve a closer look at the internal implementation of `_chain()`, `add_annotation()`, and how these methods affect the queryset's SQL compilation process.

For users facing this issue, a potential workaround could involve explicitly specifying the `GROUP BY` fields in their queries or restructuring their query logic to avoid this specific sequence of operations that leads to the issue.

Since providing a direct patch without a deeper understanding of the internal queryset mechanics and without potentially introducing regressions is not feasible, I encourage collaboration with the Django development team or community for a thorough review and testing of any proposed changes.

This response outlines the complexity of the issue and the need for careful consideration in modifying Django's ORM behavior. It also highlights the importance of community and developer collaboration in addressing framework-level issues.
