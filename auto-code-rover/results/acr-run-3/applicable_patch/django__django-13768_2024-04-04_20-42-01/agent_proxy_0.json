Given the description of the issue, the following API calls would be necessary to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the `Signal` class to understand its structure and find the file it's located in:\n   - `search_class(\"Signal\")`\n\n2. Once we have the file path for the `Signal` class, we can search for the `send_robust` method within that class to understand its current implementation:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"send_robust\", \"Signal\")`\n\nThese calls should provide enough information to start formulating a patch for logging exceptions in `Signal.send_robust()`."
