In general, SymPy functions do not work with objects from\n    other libraries, such as NumPy arrays, and functions from numeric\n    libraries like NumPy or mpmath do not work on SymPy expressions.\n    ``lambdify`` bridges the two by converting a SymPy expression to an\n    equivalent numeric function.\n\n    The basic workflow with ``lambdify`` is to first create a SymPy expression\n    representing whatever mathematical function you wish to evaluate. This\n    should be done using only SymPy functions and expressions. Then, use\n    ``lambdify`` to convert this to an equivalent function for numerical\n    evaluation. For instance, above we created ``expr`` using the SymPy symbol\n    ``x`` and SymPy functions ``sin`` and ``cos``, then converted it to an\n    equivalent NumPy function ``f``, and called it on a NumPy array ``a``.\n\n    .. warning::\n       This function uses ``exec``, and thus shouldn't be used on unsanitized\n       input.\n\n    Arguments\n    =========\n\n    The first argument of ``lambdify`` is a variable or list of variables in\n    the expression. Variable lists may be nested. Variables can be Symbols,\n    undefined functions, or matrix symbols. The order and nesting of the\n    variables corresponds to the order and nesting of the parameters passed to\n    the lambdified function. For instance,\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n    >>> f = lambdify([x, (y, z)], x + y + z)\n    >>> f(1, (2, 3))\n    6\n\n    The second argument of ``lambdify`` is the expression, list of\n    expressions, or matrix to be evaluated. Lists may be nested. If the\n    expression is a list, the output will also be a list.\n\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, [x, [x + 1, x + 2]])\n    >>> f(1)\n    [1, [2, 3]]\n\n    If it is a matrix, an array will be returned (for the NumPy module).\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, Matrix([x, x + 1]))\n    >>> f(1)\n    [[1]\n     [2]]\n\n    Note that the argument order here, variables then expression, is used to\n    emulate the Python ``lambda`` keyword. ``lambdify(x, expr)`` works\n    (roughly) like ``lambda x: expr`` (see :ref:`lambdify-how-it-works` below).\n\n    The third argument, ``modules`` is optional. If not specified, ``modules``\n    defaults to ``[\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]`` if SciPy is installed, ``[\"numpy\"]`` if\n    only NumPy is installed, and ``[\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]`` if neither is\n    installed. That is, SymPy functions are replaced as far as possible by\n    either ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` functions if available, and Python's\n    standard library ``math``, or ``mpmath`` functions otherwise.\n\n    ``modules`` can be one of the following types\n\n     - the strings ``\"math\"``, ``\"mpmath\"``, ``\"numpy\"``, ``\"numexpr\"``,\n       ``\"scipy\"``, ``\"sympy\"``, or ``\"tensorflow\"``. This uses the\n       corresponding printer and namespace mapping for that module.\n     - a module (e.g., ``math``). This uses the global namespace of the\n       module. If the module is one of the above known modules, it will also\n       use the corresponding printer and namespace mapping (i.e.,\n       ``modules=numpy`` is equivalent to ``modules=\"numpy\"``).\n     - a dictionary that maps names of SymPy functions to arbitrary functions\n       (e.g., ``{'sin': custom_sin}``).\n     - a list that contains a mix of the arguments above, with higher priority\n       given to entries appearing first (e.g., to use the NumPy module but\n       override the ``sin`` function with a custom version, you can use\n       ``[{'sin': custom_sin}, 'numpy']``).\n\n    The ``dummify`` keyword argument controls whether or not the variables in\n    the provided expression that are not valid Python identifiers are\n    substituted with dummy symbols. This allows for undefined functions like\n    ``Function('f')(t)`` to be supplied as arguments. By default, the\n    variables are only dummified if they are not valid Python identifiers. Set\n    ``dummify=True`` to replace all arguments with dummy symbols (if ``args``\n    is not a string) - for example, to ensure that the arguments do not\n    redefine any built-in names.\n\n    .. _lambdify-how-it-works:\n\n    How it works\n    ============\n\n    When using this function, it helps a great deal to have an idea of what it\n    is doing. At its core, lambdify is nothing more than a namespace\n    translation, on top of a special printer that makes some corner cases work\n    properly.\n\n    To understand lambdify, first we must properly understand how Python\n    namespaces work. Say we had two files. One called ``sin_cos_sympy.py``,\n    with\n\n    .. code:: python\n\n        # sin_cos_sympy.py\n\n        from sympy import sin, cos\n\n        def sin_cos(x):\n            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n\n\n    and one called ``sin_cos_numpy.py`` with\n\n    .. code:: python\n\n        # sin_cos_numpy.py\n\n        from numpy import sin, cos\n\n        def sin_cos(x):\n            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n\n    The two files define an identical function ``sin_cos``. However, in the\n    first file, ``sin`` and ``cos`` are defined as the SymPy ``sin`` and\n    ``cos``. In the second, they are defined as the NumPy versions.\n\n    If we were to import the first file and use the ``sin_cos`` function, we\n    would get something like\n\n    >>> from sin_cos_sympy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n    cos(1) + sin(1)\n\n    On the other hand, if we imported ``sin_cos`` from the second file, we\n    would get\n\n    >>> from sin_cos_numpy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n    1.38177329068\n\n    In the first case we got a symbolic output, because it used the symbolic\n    ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions from SymPy. In the second, we got a numeric\n    result, because ``sin_cos`` used the numeric ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions\n    from NumPy. But notice that the versions of ``sin`` and ``cos`` that were\n    used was not inherent to the ``sin_cos`` function definition. Both\n    ``sin_cos`` definitions are exactly the same. Rather, it was based on the\n    names defined at the module where the ``sin_cos`` function was defined.\n\n    The key point here is that when function in Python references a name that\n    is not defined in the function, that name is looked up in the \"global\"\n    namespace of the module where that function is defined.\n\n    Now, in Python, we can emulate this behavior without actually writing a\n    file to disk using the ``exec`` function. ``exec`` takes a string\n    containing a block of Python code, and a dictionary that should contain\n    the global variables of the module. It then executes the code \"in\" that\n    dictionary, as if it were the module globals. The following is equivalent\n    to the ``sin_cos`` defined in ``sin_cos_sympy.py``:\n\n    >>> import sympy\n    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': sympy.sin, 'cos': sympy.cos}\n    >>> exec('''\n    ... def sin_cos(x):\n    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n    ... ''', module_dictionary)\n    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n    >>> sin_cos(1)\n    cos(1) + sin(1)\n\n    and similarly with ``sin_cos_numpy``:\n\n    >>> import numpy\n    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': numpy.sin, 'cos': numpy.cos}\n    >>> exec('''\n    ... def sin_cos(x):\n    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n    ... ''', module_dictionary)\n    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n    >>> sin_cos(1)\n    1.38177329068\n\n    So now we can get an idea of how ``lambdify`` works. The name \"lambdify\"\n    comes from the fact that we can think of something like ``lambdify(x,\n    sin(x) + cos(x), 'numpy')`` as ``lambda x: sin(x) + cos(x)``, where\n    ``sin`` and ``cos`` come from the ``numpy`` namespace. This is also why\n    the symbols argument is first in ``lambdify``, as opposed to most SymPy\n    functions where it comes after the expression: to better mimic the\n    ``lambda`` keyword.\n\n    ``lambdify`` takes the input expression (like ``sin(x) + cos(x)``) and\n\n    1. Converts it to a string\n    2. Creates a module globals dictionary based on the modules that are\n       passed in (by default, it uses the NumPy module)\n    3. Creates the string ``\"def func({vars}): return {expr}\"``, where ``{vars}`` is the\n       list of variables separated by commas, and ``{expr}`` is the string\n       created in step 1., then ``exec``s that string with the module globals\n       namespace and returns ``func``.\n\n    In fact, functions returned by ``lambdify`` support inspection. So you can\n    see exactly how they are defined by using ``inspect.getsource``, or ``??`` if you\n    are using IPython or the Jupyter notebook.\n\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x) + cos(x))\n    >>> import inspect\n    >>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\n    def _lambdifygenerated(x):\n        return (sin(x) + cos(x))\n\n    This shows us the source code of the function, but not the namespace it\n    was defined in. We can inspect that by looking at the ``__globals__``\n    attribute of ``f``:\n\n    >>> f.__globals__['sin']\n    <ufunc 'sin'>\n    >>> f.__globals__['cos']\n    <ufunc 'cos'>\n    >>> f.__globals__['sin'] is numpy.sin\n    True\n\n    This shows us that ``sin`` and ``cos`` in the namespace of ``f`` will be\n    ``numpy.sin`` and ``numpy.cos``.\n\n    Note that there are some convenience layers in each of these steps, but at\n    the core, this is how ``lambdify`` works. Step 1 is done using the\n    ``LambdaPrinter`` printers defined in the printing module (see\n    :mod:`sympy.printing.lambdarepr`). This allows different SymPy expressions\n    to define how they should be converted to a string for different modules.\n    You can change which printer ``lambdify`` uses by passing a custom printer\n    in to the ``printer`` argument.\n\n    Step 2 is augmented by certain translations. There are default\n    translations for each module, but you can provide your own by passing a\n    list to the ``modules`` argument. For instance,\n\n    >>> def mysin(x):\n    ...     print('taking the sin of', x)\n    ...     return numpy.sin(x)\n    ...\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), [{'sin': mysin}, 'numpy'])\n    >>> f(1)\n    taking the sin of 1\n    0.8414709848078965\n\n    The globals dictionary is generated from the list by merging the\n    dictionary ``{'sin': mysin}`` and the module dictionary for NumPy. The\n    merging is done so that earlier items take precedence, which is why\n    ``mysin`` is used above instead of ``numpy.sin``.\n\n    If you want to modify the way ``lambdify`` works for a given function, it\n    is usually easiest to do so by modifying the globals dictionary as such.\n    In more complicated cases, it may be necessary to create and pass in a\n    custom printer.\n\n    Finally, step 3 is augmented with certain convenience operations, such as\n    the addition of a docstring.\n\n    Understanding how ``lambdify`` works can make it easier to avoid certain\n    gotchas when using it. For instance, a common mistake is to create a\n    lambdified function for one module (say, NumPy), and pass it objects from\n    another (say, a SymPy expression).\n\n    For instance, say we create\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, x + 1, 'numpy')\n\n    Now if we pass in a NumPy array, we get that array plus 1\n\n    >>> import numpy\n    >>> a = numpy.array([1, 2])\n    >>> f(a)\n    [2 3]\n\n    But what happens if you make the mistake of passing in a SymPy expression\n    instead of a NumPy array:\n\n    >>> f(x + 1)\n    x + 2\n\n    This worked, but it was only by accident. Now take a different lambdified\n    function:\n\n    >>> from sympy import sin\n    >>> g = lambdify(x, x + sin(x), 'numpy')\n\n    This works as expected on NumPy arrays:\n\n    >>> g(a)\n    [1.84147098 2.90929743]\n\n    But if we try to pass in a SymPy expression, it fails\n\n    >>> g(x + 1)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    AttributeError: 'Add' object has no attribute 'sin'\n\n    Now, let's look at what happened. The reason this fails is that ``g``\n    calls ``numpy.sin`` on the input expression, and ``numpy.sin`` does not\n    know how to operate on a SymPy object. **As a general rule, NumPy\n    functions do not know how to operate on SymPy expressions, and SymPy\n    functions do not know how to operate on NumPy arrays. This is why lambdify\n    exists: to provide a bridge between SymPy and NumPy.**\n\n    However, why is it that ``f`` did work? That's because ``f`` doesn't call\n    any functions, it only adds 1. So the resulting function that is created,\n    ``def _lambdifygenerated(x): return x + 1`` does not depend on the globals\n    namespace it is defined in. Thus it works, but only by accident. A future\n    version of ``lambdify`` may remove this behavior.\n\n    Be aware that certain implementation details described here may change in\n    future versions of SymPy. The API of passing in custom modules and\n    printers will not change, but the details of how a lambda function is\n    created may change. However, the basic idea will remain the same, and\n    understanding it will be helpful to understanding the behavior of\n    lambdify.\n\n    **In general: you should create lambdified functions for one module (say,\n    NumPy), and only pass it input types that are compatible with that module\n    (say, NumPy arrays).** Remember that by default, if the ``module``\n    argument is not provided, ``lambdify`` creates functions using the NumPy\n    and SciPy namespaces.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n    >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, Matrix\n    >>> from sympy import Function\n    >>> from sympy.abc import w, x, y, z\n\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, x**2)\n    >>> f(2)\n    4\n    >>> f = lambdify((x, y, z), [z, y, x])\n    >>> f(1,2,3)\n    [3, 2, 1]\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sqrt(x))\n    >>> f(4)\n    2.0\n    >>> f = lambdify((x, y), sin(x*y)**2)\n    >>> f(0, 5)\n    0.0\n    >>> row = lambdify((x, y), Matrix((x, x + y)).T, modules='sympy')\n    >>> row(1, 2)\n    Matrix([[1, 3]])\n\n    ``lambdify`` can be used to translate SymPy expressions into mpmath\n    functions. This may be preferable to using ``evalf`` (which uses mpmath on\n    the backend) in some cases.\n\n    >>> import mpmath\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), 'mpmath')\n    >>> f(1)\n    0.8414709848078965\n\n    Tuple arguments are handled and the lambdified function should\n    be called with the same type of arguments as were used to create\n    the function:\n\n    >>> f = lambdify((x, (y, z)), x + y)\n    >>> f(1, (2, 4))\n    3\n\n    The ``flatten`` function can be used to always work with flattened\n    arguments:\n\n    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import flatten\n    >>> args = w, (x, (y, z))\n    >>> vals = 1, (2, (3, 4))\n    >>> f = lambdify(flatten(args), w + x + y + z)\n    >>> f(*flatten(vals))\n    10\n\n    Functions present in ``expr`` can also carry their own numerical\n    implementations, in a callable attached to the ``_imp_`` attribute. This\n    can be used with undefined functions using the ``implemented_function``\n    factory:\n\n    >>> f = implemented_function(Function('f'), lambda x: x+1)\n    >>> func = lambdify(x, f(x))\n    >>> func(4)\n    5\n\n    ``lambdify`` always prefers ``_imp_`` implementations to implementations\n    in other namespaces, unless the ``use_imps`` input parameter is False.\n\n    Usage with Tensorflow:\n\n    >>> import tensorflow as tf\n    >>> from sympy import Max, sin\n    >>> f = Max(x, sin(x))\n    >>> func = lambdify(x, f, 'tensorflow')\n    >>> result = func(tf.constant(1.0))\n    >>> print(result) # a tf.Tensor representing the result of the calculation\n    Tensor(\"Maximum:0\", shape=(), dtype=float32)\n    >>> sess = tf.Session()\n    >>> sess.run(result) # compute result\n    1.0\n    >>> var = tf.Variable(1.0)\n    >>> sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n    >>> sess.run(func(var)) # also works for tf.Variable and tf.Placeholder\n    1.0\n    >>> tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]) # works with any shape tensor\n    >>> sess.run(func(tensor))\n    [[1. 2.]\n     [3. 4.]]\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    - For functions involving large array calculations, numexpr can provide a\n      significant speedup over numpy. Please note that the available functions\n      for numexpr are more limited than numpy but can be expanded with\n      ``implemented_function`` and user defined subclasses of Function. If\n      specified, numexpr may be the only option in modules. The official list\n      of numexpr functions can be found at:\n      https://numexpr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#supported-functions\n\n    - In previous versions of SymPy, ``lambdify`` replaced ``Matrix`` with\n      ``numpy.matrix`` by default. As of SymPy 1.0 ``numpy.array`` is the\n      default. To get the old default behavior you must pass in\n      ``[{'ImmutableDenseMatrix':  numpy.matrix}, 'numpy']`` to the\n      ``modules`` kwarg.\n\n      >>> from sympy import lambdify, Matrix\n      >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n      >>> import numpy\n      >>> array2mat = [{'ImmutableDenseMatrix': numpy.matrix}, 'numpy']\n      >>> f = lambdify((x, y), Matrix([x, y]), modules=array2mat)\n      >>> f(1, 2)\n      [[1]\n       [2]]\n\n    - In the above examples, the generated functions can accept scalar\n      values or numpy arrays as arguments.

It primarily serves as a bridge between SymPy expressions and numerical libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and others.\n   - It uses `exec` to dynamically create functions based on the expression passed to it. The namespaces (or modules) specified in the `modules` argument determine which numerical library's functions are used in the generated function.\n   - The `lambdify` function supports a wide range of inputs, including symbols, undefined functions, and matrix symbols. It also allows for customization of the output through the `modules` and `printer` arguments.\n\n2. **MatrixSymbol and Identity Classes**:\n   - Both `MatrixSymbol` and `Identity` classes are defined in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. `MatrixSymbol` represents a symbolic matrix, and `Identity` represents the identity matrix.\n   - These classes are part of SymPy's matrix expressions system, which allows for symbolic manipulation of matrices.\n\n3. **Code Printer**:\n   - The search for \"code printer\" yielded multiple results across different files, indicating that SymPy has a variety of printers for different programming languages (e.g., C, Python, JavaScript) and purposes (e.g., generating code for numerical computation libraries like NumPy).\n   - The mention of `code printer` in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` suggests that `lambdify` uses these printers to convert SymPy expressions into strings of code that are then executed to create the numeric functions.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how the `lambdify` function, through its use of code printers, translates the `Identity` matrix into code. Specifically, the problem arises because the symbol `I`, which is intended to represent the identity matrix in the symbolic expression, is being interpreted as the complex number `1j` in the generated Python code. This misinterpretation likely occurs during the code generation process, where the symbol `I` is not correctly mapped to an identity matrix representation in the target numerical library (e.g., NumPy).\n\nTo address this issue, we may need to:\n- Investigate how the `lambdify` function and the relevant code printer handle symbols like `I` and ensure they correctly interpret `I` as an identity matrix rather than a complex number when dealing with matrix expressions.\n- Explore the possibility of enhancing the code printer(s) used by `lambdify` to support explicit printing of identity matrices in a way that is compatible with the target numerical libraries.\n\nNext steps could involve looking into the specific code printers that `lambdify` uses for generating NumPy code and determining how they can be modified or extended to correctly handle the `Identity` matrix."

The exact file and method would be clearer after further investigation into how printers are implemented and used within `lambdify`.\n\nThe resolution of the issue would involve ensuring that the `Identity` matrix is correctly interpreted and translated into an appropriate NumPy representation, rather than being confused with the complex number `I`. This might require modifications to both `lambdify` and the involved printer(s) to handle matrix symbols and identity matrices accurately."

In general, SymPy functions do not work with objects from\n    other libraries, such as NumPy arrays, and functions from numeric\n    libraries like NumPy or mpmath do not work on SymPy expressions.\n    ``lambdify`` bridges the two by converting a SymPy expression to an\n    equivalent numeric function.\n\n    The basic workflow with ``lambdify`` is to first create a SymPy expression\n    representing whatever mathematical function you wish to evaluate. This\n    should be done using only SymPy functions and expressions. Then, use\n    ``lambdify`` to convert this to an equivalent function for numerical\n    evaluation. For instance, above we created ``expr`` using the SymPy symbol\n    ``x`` and SymPy functions ``sin`` and ``cos``, then converted it to an\n    equivalent NumPy function ``f``, and called it on a NumPy array ``a``.\n\n    .. warning::\n       This function uses ``exec``, and thus shouldn't be used on unsanitized\n       input.\n\n    Arguments\n    =========\n\n    The first argument of ``lambdify`` is a variable or list of variables in\n    the expression. Variable lists may be nested. Variables can be Symbols,\n    undefined functions, or matrix symbols. The order and nesting of the\n    variables corresponds to the order and nesting of the parameters passed to\n    the lambdified function. For instance,\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n    >>> f = lambdify([x, (y, z)], x + y + z)\n    >>> f(1, (2, 3))\n    6\n\n    The second argument of ``lambdify`` is the expression, list of\n    expressions, or matrix to be evaluated. Lists may be nested. If the\n    expression is a list, the output will also be a list.\n\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, [x, [x + 1, x + 2]])\n    >>> f(1)\n    [1, [2, 3]]\n\n    If it is a matrix, an array will be returned (for the NumPy module).\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, Matrix([x, x + 1]))\n    >>> f(1)\n    [[1]\n     [2]]\n\n    Note that the argument order here, variables then expression, is used to\n    emulate the Python ``lambda`` keyword. ``lambdify(x, expr)`` works\n    (roughly) like ``lambda x: expr`` (see :ref:`lambdify-how-it-works` below).\n\n    The third argument, ``modules`` is optional. If not specified, ``modules``\n    defaults to ``[\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]`` if SciPy is installed, ``[\"numpy\"]`` if\n    only NumPy is installed, and ``[\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]`` if neither is\n    installed. That is, SymPy functions are replaced as far as possible by\n    either ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` functions if available, and Python's\n    standard library ``math``, or ``mpmath`` functions otherwise.\n\n    ``modules`` can be one of the following types\n\n     - the strings ``\"math\"``, ``\"mpmath\"``, ``\"numpy\"``, ``\"numexpr\"``,\n       ``\"scipy\"``, ``\"sympy\"``, or ``\"tensorflow\"``. This uses the\n       corresponding printer and namespace mapping for that module.\n     - a module (e.g., ``math``). This uses the global namespace of the\n       module. If the module is one of the above known modules, it will also\n       use the corresponding printer and namespace mapping (i.e.,\n       ``modules=numpy`` is equivalent to ``modules=\"numpy\"``).\n     - a dictionary that maps names of SymPy functions to arbitrary functions\n       (e.g., ``{'sin': custom_sin}``).\n     - a list that contains a mix of the arguments above, with higher priority\n       given to entries appearing first (e.g., to use the NumPy module but\n       override the ``sin`` function with a custom version, you can use\n       ``[{'sin': custom_sin}, 'numpy']``).\n\n    The ``dummify`` keyword argument controls whether or not the variables in\n    the provided expression that are not valid Python identifiers are\n    substituted with dummy symbols. This allows for undefined functions like\n    ``Function('f')(t)`` to be supplied as arguments. By default, the\n    variables are only dummified if they are not valid Python identifiers. Set\n    ``dummify=True`` to replace all arguments with dummy symbols (if ``args``\n    is not a string) - for example, to ensure that the arguments do not\n    redefine any built-in names.\n\n    .. _lambdify-how-it-works:\n\n    How it works\n    ============\n\n    When using this function, it helps a great deal to have an idea of what it\n    is doing. At its core, lambdify is nothing more than a namespace\n    translation, on top of a special printer that makes some corner cases work\n    properly.\n\n    To understand lambdify, first we must properly understand how Python\n    namespaces work. Say we had two files. One called ``sin_cos_sympy.py``,\n    with\n\n    .. code:: python\n\n        # sin_cos_sympy.py\n\n        from sympy import sin, cos\n\n        def sin_cos(x):\n            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n\n\n    and one called ``sin_cos_numpy.py`` with\n\n    .. code:: python\n\n        # sin_cos_numpy.py\n\n        from numpy import sin, cos\n\n        def sin_cos(x):\n            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n\n    The two files define an identical function ``sin_cos``. However, in the\n    first file, ``sin`` and ``cos`` are defined as the SymPy ``sin`` and\n    ``cos``. In the second, they are defined as the NumPy versions.\n\n    If we were to import the first file and use the ``sin_cos`` function, we\n    would get something like\n\n    >>> from sin_cos_sympy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n    cos(1) + sin(1)\n\n    On the other hand, if we imported ``sin_cos`` from the second file, we\n    would get\n\n    >>> from sin_cos_numpy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n    1.38177329068\n\n    In the first case we got a symbolic output, because it used the symbolic\n    ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions from SymPy. In the second, we got a numeric\n    result, because ``sin_cos`` used the numeric ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions\n    from NumPy. But notice that the versions of ``sin`` and ``cos`` that were\n    used was not inherent to the ``sin_cos`` function definition. Both\n    ``sin_cos`` definitions are exactly the same. Rather, it was based on the\n    names defined at the module where the ``sin_cos`` function was defined.\n\n    The key point here is that when function in Python references a name that\n    is not defined in the function, that name is looked up in the \"global\"\n    namespace of the module where that function is defined.\n\n    Now, in Python, we can emulate this behavior without actually writing a\n    file to disk using the ``exec`` function. ``exec`` takes a string\n    containing a block of Python code, and a dictionary that should contain\n    the global variables of the module. It then executes the code \"in\" that\n    dictionary, as if it were the module globals. The following is equivalent\n    to the ``sin_cos`` defined in ``sin_cos_sympy.py``:\n\n    >>> import sympy\n    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': sympy.sin, 'cos': sympy.cos}\n    >>> exec('''\n    ... def sin_cos(x):\n    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n    ... ''', module_dictionary)\n    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n    >>> sin_cos(1)\n    cos(1) + sin(1)\n\n    and similarly with ``sin_cos_numpy``:\n\n    >>> import numpy\n    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': numpy.sin, 'cos': numpy.cos}\n    >>> exec('''\n    ... def sin_cos(x):\n    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n    ... ''', module_dictionary)\n    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n    >>> sin_cos(1)\n    1.38177329068\n\n    So now we can get an idea of how ``lambdify`` works. The name \"lambdify\"\n    comes from the fact that we can think of something like ``lambdify(x,\n    sin(x) + cos(x), 'numpy')`` as ``lambda x: sin(x) + cos(x)``, where\n    ``sin`` and ``cos`` come from the ``numpy`` namespace. This is also why\n    the symbols argument is first in ``lambdify``, as opposed to most SymPy\n    functions where it comes after the expression: to better mimic the\n    ``lambda`` keyword.\n\n    ``lambdify`` takes the input expression (like ``sin(x) + cos(x)``) and\n\n    1. Converts it to a string\n    2. Creates a module globals dictionary based on the modules that are\n       passed in (by default, it uses the NumPy module)\n    3. Creates the string ``\"def func({vars}): return {expr}\"``, where ``{vars}`` is the\n       list of variables separated by commas, and ``{expr}`` is the string\n       created in step 1., then ``exec``s that string with the module globals\n       namespace and returns ``func``.\n\n    In fact, functions returned by ``lambdify`` support inspection. So you can\n    see exactly how they are defined by using ``inspect.getsource``, or ``??`` if you\n    are using IPython or the Jupyter notebook.\n\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x) + cos(x))\n    >>> import inspect\n    >>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\n    def _lambdifygenerated(x):\n        return (sin(x) + cos(x))\n\n    This shows us the source code of the function, but not the namespace it\n    was defined in. We can inspect that by looking at the ``__globals__``\n    attribute of ``f``:\n\n    >>> f.__globals__['sin']\n    <ufunc 'sin'>\n    >>> f.__globals__['cos']\n    <ufunc 'cos'>\n    >>> f.__globals__['sin'] is numpy.sin\n    True\n\n    This shows us that ``sin`` and ``cos`` in the namespace of ``f`` will be\n    ``numpy.sin`` and ``numpy.cos``.\n\n    Note that there are some convenience layers in each of these steps, but at\n    the core, this is how ``lambdify`` works. Step 1 is done using the\n    ``LambdaPrinter`` printers defined in the printing module (see\n    :mod:`sympy.printing.lambdarepr`). This allows different SymPy expressions\n    to define how they should be converted to a string for different modules.\n    You can change which printer ``lambdify`` uses by passing a custom printer\n    in to the ``printer`` argument.\n\n    Step 2 is augmented by certain translations. There are default\n    translations for each module, but you can provide your own by passing a\n    list to the ``modules`` argument. For instance,\n\n    >>> def mysin(x):\n    ...     print('taking the sin of', x)\n    ...     return numpy.sin(x)\n    ...\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), [{'sin': mysin}, 'numpy'])\n    >>> f(1)\n    taking the sin of 1\n    0.8414709848078965\n\n    The globals dictionary is generated from the list by merging the\n    dictionary ``{'sin': mysin}`` and the module dictionary for NumPy. The\n    merging is done so that earlier items take precedence, which is why\n    ``mysin`` is used above instead of ``numpy.sin``.\n\n    If you want to modify the way ``lambdify`` works for a given function, it\n    is usually easiest to do so by modifying the globals dictionary as such.\n    In more complicated cases, it may be necessary to create and pass in a\n    custom printer.\n\n    Finally, step 3 is augmented with certain convenience operations, such as\n    the addition of a docstring.\n\n    Understanding how ``lambdify`` works can make it easier to avoid certain\n    gotchas when using it. For instance, a common mistake is to create a\n    lambdified function for one module (say, NumPy), and pass it objects from\n    another (say, a SymPy expression).\n\n    For instance, say we create\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, x + 1, 'numpy')\n\n    Now if we pass in a NumPy array, we get that array plus 1\n\n    >>> import numpy\n    >>> a = numpy.array([1, 2])\n    >>> f(a)\n    [2 3]\n\n    But what happens if you make the mistake of passing in a SymPy expression\n    instead of a NumPy array:\n\n    >>> f(x + 1)\n    x + 2\n\n    This worked, but it was only by accident. Now take a different lambdified\n    function:\n\n    >>> from sympy import sin\n    >>> g = lambdify(x, x + sin(x), 'numpy')\n\n    This works as expected on NumPy arrays:\n\n    >>> g(a)\n    [1.84147098 2.90929743]\n\n    But if we try to pass in a SymPy expression, it fails\n\n    >>> g(x + 1)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    AttributeError: 'Add' object has no attribute 'sin'\n\n    Now, let's look at what happened. The reason this fails is that ``g``\n    calls ``numpy.sin`` on the input expression, and ``numpy.sin`` does not\n    know how to operate on a SymPy object. **As a general rule, NumPy\n    functions do not know how to operate on SymPy expressions, and SymPy\n    functions do not know how to operate on NumPy arrays. This is why lambdify\n    exists: to provide a bridge between SymPy and NumPy.**\n\n    However, why is it that ``f`` did work? That's because ``f`` doesn't call\n    any functions, it only adds 1. So the resulting function that is created,\n    ``def _lambdifygenerated(x): return x + 1`` does not depend on the globals\n    namespace it is defined in. Thus it works, but only by accident. A future\n    version of ``lambdify`` may remove this behavior.\n\n    Be aware that certain implementation details described here may change in\n    future versions of SymPy. The API of passing in custom modules and\n    printers will not change, but the details of how a lambda function is\n    created may change. However, the basic idea will remain the same, and\n    understanding it will be helpful to understanding the behavior of\n    lambdify.\n\n    **In general: you should create lambdified functions for one module (say,\n    NumPy), and only pass it input types that are compatible with that module\n    (say, NumPy arrays).** Remember that by default, if the ``module``\n    argument is not provided, ``lambdify`` creates functions using the NumPy\n    and SciPy namespaces.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n    >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, Matrix\n    >>> from sympy import Function\n    >>> from sympy.abc import w, x, y, z\n\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, x**2)\n    >>> f(2)\n    4\n    >>> f = lambdify((x, y, z), [z, y, x])\n    >>> f(1,2,3)\n    [3, 2, 1]\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sqrt(x))\n    >>> f(4)\n    2.0\n    >>> f = lambdify((x, y), sin(x*y)**2)\n    >>> f(0, 5)\n    0.0\n    >>> row = lambdify((x, y), Matrix((x, x + y)).T, modules='sympy')\n    >>> row(1, 2)\n    Matrix([[1, 3]])\n\n    ``lambdify`` can be used to translate SymPy expressions into mpmath\n    functions. This may be preferable to using ``evalf`` (which uses mpmath on\n    the backend) in some cases.\n\n    >>> import mpmath\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), 'mpmath')\n    >>> f(1)\n    0.8414709848078965\n\n    Tuple arguments are handled and the lambdified function should\n    be called with the same type of arguments as were used to create\n    the function:\n\n    >>> f = lambdify((x, (y, z)), x + y)\n    >>> f(1, (2, 4))\n    3\n\n    The ``flatten`` function can be used to always work with flattened\n    arguments:\n\n    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import flatten\n    >>> args = w, (x, (y, z))\n    >>> vals = 1, (2, (3, 4))\n    >>> f = lambdify(flatten(args), w + x + y + z)\n    >>> f(*flatten(vals))\n    10\n\n    Functions present in ``expr`` can also carry their own numerical\n    implementations, in a callable attached to the ``_imp_`` attribute. This\n    can be used with undefined functions using the ``implemented_function``\n    factory:\n\n    >>> f = implemented_function(Function('f'), lambda x: x+1)\n    >>> func = lambdify(x, f(x))\n    >>> func(4)\n    5\n\n    ``lambdify`` always prefers ``_imp_`` implementations to implementations\n    in other namespaces, unless the ``use_imps`` input parameter is False.\n\n    Usage with Tensorflow:\n\n    >>> import tensorflow as tf\n    >>> from sympy import Max, sin\n    >>> f = Max(x, sin(x))\n    >>> func = lambdify(x, f, 'tensorflow')\n    >>> result = func(tf.constant(1.0))\n    >>> print(result) # a tf.Tensor representing the result of the calculation\n    Tensor(\"Maximum:0\", shape=(), dtype=float32)\n    >>> sess = tf.Session()\n    >>> sess.run(result) # compute result\n    1.0\n    >>> var = tf.Variable(1.0)\n    >>> sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n    >>> sess.run(func(var)) # also works for tf.Variable and tf.Placeholder\n    1.0\n    >>> tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]) # works with any shape tensor\n    >>> sess.run(func(tensor))\n    [[1. 2.]\n     [3. 4.]]\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    - For functions involving large array calculations, numexpr can provide a\n      significant speedup over numpy. Please note that the available functions\n      for numexpr are more limited than numpy but can be expanded with\n      ``implemented_function`` and user defined subclasses of Function. If\n      specified, numexpr may be the only option in modules. The official list\n      of numexpr functions can be found at:\n      https://numexpr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#supported-functions\n\n    - In previous versions of SymPy, ``lambdify`` replaced ``Matrix`` with\n      ``numpy.matrix`` by default. As of SymPy 1.0 ``numpy.array`` is the\n      default. To get the old default behavior you must pass in\n      ``[{'ImmutableDenseMatrix':  numpy.matrix}, 'numpy']`` to the\n      ``modules`` kwarg.\n\n      >>> from sympy import lambdify, Matrix\n      >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n      >>> import numpy\n      >>> array2mat = [{'ImmutableDenseMatrix': numpy.matrix}, 'numpy']\n      >>> f = lambdify((x, y), Matrix([x, y]), modules=array2mat)\n      >>> f(1, 2)\n      [[1]\n       [2]]\n\n    - In the above examples, the generated functions can accept scalar\n      values or numpy arrays as arguments.  However, in some cases\n      the generated function relies on the input being a numpy array:\n\n      >>> from sympy import Piecewise\n      >>> from sympy.utilities.pytest import ignore_warnings\n      >>> f = lambdify(x, Piecewise((x, x <= 1), (1/x, x > 1)), \"numpy\")\n\n      >>> with ignore_warnings(RuntimeWarning):\n      ...     f(numpy.array([-1, 0, 1, 2]))\n      [-1.   0.   1.   0.5]\n\n      >>> f(0)\n      Traceback (most recent call last):\n          ...\n      ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n      In such cases, the input should be wrapped in a numpy array:\n\n      >>> with ignore_warnings(RuntimeWarning):\n      ...     float(f(numpy.array([0])))\n      0.0\n\n      Or if numpy functionality is not required another module can be used:\n\n      >>> f = lambdify(x, Piecewise((x, x <= 1), (1/x, x > 1)), \"math\")\n      >>> f(0)\n      0\n\n    \"\"\"\n    from sympy.core.symbol import Symbol\n\n    # If the user hasn't specified any modules, use what is available.\n    if modules is None:\n        try:\n            _import(\"scipy\")\n        except ImportError:\n            try:\n                _import(\"numpy\")\n            except ImportError:\n                # Use either numpy (if available) or python.math where possible.\n                # XXX: This leads to different behaviour on different systems and\n                #      might be the reason for irreproducible errors.\n                modules = [\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]\n            else:\n                modules = [\"numpy\"]\n        else:\n            modules = [\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]\n\n    # Get the needed namespaces.\n    namespaces = []\n    # First find any function implementations\n    if use_imps:\n        namespaces.append(_imp_namespace(expr))\n    # Check for dict before iterating\n    if isinstance(modules, (dict, string_types)) or not hasattr(modules, '__iter__'):\n        namespaces.append(modules)\n    else:\n        # consistency check\n        if _module_present('numexpr', modules) and len(modules) > 1:\n            raise TypeError(\"numexpr must be the only item in 'modules'\")\n        namespaces += list(modules)\n    # fill namespace with first having highest priority\n    namespace = {}\n    for m in namespaces[::-1]:\n        buf = _get_namespace(m)\n        namespace.update(buf)\n\n    if hasattr(expr, \"atoms\"):\n        #Try if you can extract symbols from the expression.\n        #Move on if expr.atoms in not implemented.\n        syms = expr.atoms(Symbol)\n        for term in syms:\n            namespace.update({str(term): term})\n\n    if printer is None:\n        if _module_present('mpmath', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.pycode import MpmathPrinter as Printer\n        elif _module_present('scipy', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.pycode import SciPyPrinter as Printer\n        elif _module_present('numpy', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.pycode import NumPyPrinter as Printer\n        elif _module_present('numexpr', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.lambdarepr import NumExprPrinter as Printer\n        elif _module_present('tensorflow', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.tensorflow import TensorflowPrinter as Printer\n        elif _module_present('sympy', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.pycode import SymPyPrinter as Printer\n        else:\n            from sympy.printing.pycode import PythonCodePrinter as Printer\n        user_functions = {}\n        for m in namespaces[::-1]:\n            if isinstance(m, dict):\n                for k in m:\n                    user_functions[k] = k\n        printer = Printer({'fully_qualified_modules': False, 'inline': True,\n                           'allow_unknown_functions': True,\n                           'user_functions': user_functions})\n\n    # Get the names of the args, for creating a docstring\n    if not iterable(args):\n        args = (args,)\n    names = []\n    # Grab the callers frame, for getting the names by inspection (if needed)\n    callers_local_vars = inspect.currentframe().f_back.f_locals.items()\n    for n, var in enumerate(args):\n        if hasattr(var, 'name'):\n            names.append(var.name)\n        else:\n            # It's an iterable.

It extends the `PythonCodePrinter` and customizes it for NumPy-specific code generation.\n   - It has a method `_print_MatrixBase` which likely handles the printing of matrix expressions. However, there's no explicit mention of a method dedicated to handling the identity matrix (`Identity`) directly. This could be a potential area where the handling of the identity matrix needs to be improved or explicitly defined.\n\n2. **Lambdify Function Details**:\n   - The `lambdify` function, as detailed in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`, translates SymPy expressions into equivalent numeric functions, with a significant focus on bridging SymPy with numerical libraries like NumPy.\n   - It uses the concept of namespaces and printers to convert expressions. The `modules` argument plays a crucial role in determining which numerical library's functions are used in the generated function. The `printer` argument allows for customization of how expressions are converted to strings of code.\n   - The process involves creating a module globals dictionary based on the modules passed in, converting the expression to a string, and then executing this string with the module globals namespace to return the numeric function.\n\n3. **Printer Selection and Customization**:\n   - The selection of a specific printer (e.g., `NumPyPrinter`) is based on the `modules` and `printer` arguments provided to `lambdify`. If no printer is explicitly specified, `lambdify` chooses one based on the modules available and the target numerical library specified.\n   - The `printer` customization allows for modifications in how expressions are translated to code, which could be leveraged to address the issue with the identity matrix.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nThe issue with `lambdify` misinterpreting some matrix expressions, specifically the identity matrix, seems to be related to how the `NumPyPrinter` (or the printer being used) translates the `Identity` matrix into NumPy code. Since there's no explicit handling mentioned for the `Identity` matrix in the `NumPyPrinter`, the solution might involve enhancing this printer to correctly interpret and translate the `Identity` matrix into an appropriate NumPy representation (e.g., `numpy.eye(n)`).\n\n**Potential Bug Locations**:\n- **Buggy File**: `sympy/printing/pycode.py`\n  - **Potential Enhancement**: Implement or modify a method in the `NumPyPrinter` class to correctly handle the `Identity` matrix.\n- **Related Function**: `lambdify` in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`\n  - **Insight**: Understanding how `lambdify` selects and uses printers based on the `modules` and `printer` arguments is crucial. Any enhancements made to the `NumPyPrinter` (or relevant printer) should be compatible with how `lambdify` utilizes these printers.\n\nTo address the issue, the next steps would involve modifying the `NumPyPrinter` to ensure that the `Identity` matrix is correctly translated into NumPy code, preventing it from being misinterpreted as a complex number. This might require adding a new printing method or modifying existing ones to handle the `Identity` matrix explicitly."
