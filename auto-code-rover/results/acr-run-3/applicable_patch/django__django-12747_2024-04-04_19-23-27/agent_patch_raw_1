To address the inconsistency in the result when zero objects are deleted by the `Collector.delete` method, we need to ensure that the `deleted_counter` dictionary is initialized with all models set to zero deletions. This way, whether or not objects of a certain model are deleted, the model will still appear in the result with a deletion count of zero if no objects were deleted. This approach ensures consistency in the result format.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/deletion.py</file>
<original># number of objects deleted for each model label
deleted_counter = Counter()</original>
<patched># number of objects deleted for each model label
# Initialize deleted_counter with all models set to zero deletions
deleted_counter = Counter({model._meta.label: 0 for model in self.data})</patched>
```

This modification ensures that before any deletion operations are performed, the `deleted_counter` dictionary contains an entry for every model involved in the deletion process, initialized to zero. This change addresses the inconsistency by ensuring that the result format is the same regardless of whether models have foreign keys or not, and regardless of whether any objects are actually deleted.
