<patched># Correctly handle the permutation of solutions when custom symbols order is provided
if syms and set(syms) != set(var):
    dict_sym_index = dict(zip(var, range(len(var))))
    original_solutions = diophantine(eq, param, permute=permute)
    permuted_solutions = set()
    for sol in original_solutions:
        # Reorder each solution tuple according to the custom symbols order
        permuted_solution = tuple(sol[dict_sym_index[sym]] for sym in syms)
        permuted_solutions.add(permuted_solution)
    return permuted_solutions</patched>
```

Explanation:
The original code block attempts to reorder the solutions based on the custom symbols order (`syms`) provided by the user. However, it incorrectly returns from the function immediately after reordering, without considering the `permute` flag or applying any necessary permutations to the solutions. The patched code corrects this behavior by first generating all solutions with the `diophantine` function, considering the `permute` flag as intended. Then, it reorders each solution tuple according to the custom symbols order before returning the final set of permuted and correctly ordered solutions. This ensures that the function's behavior is consistent regardless of the symbols' order and respects the `permute` flag.
