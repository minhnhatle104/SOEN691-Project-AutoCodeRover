# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/backends/base/creation.py</file>
<original>if serialize:
    self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()</original>
<patched>if serialize and self.connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('MIGRATE', True):
    # Only serialize database contents if migrations are not skipped.
    # This avoids serialization errors when certain tables are missing due to skipped migrations.
    self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that when `MIGRATE` is set to `False`, the system still performs a minimal set of migrations necessary for Django's core functionality. This is crucial for tests that rely on models from `auth`, `contenttypes`, and `sessions`. Additionally, it conditionally skips the serialization step when migrations are skipped, preventing errors related to missing tables. This approach maintains the performance benefits of skipping migrations while ensuring the database is in a usable state for tests.
