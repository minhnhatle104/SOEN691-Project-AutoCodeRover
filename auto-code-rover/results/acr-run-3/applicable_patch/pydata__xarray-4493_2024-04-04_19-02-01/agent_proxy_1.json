The correct class name should be `Dataset` (not `DataSet`), and understanding the implementation of its `update` method is crucial. Therefore, the following corrected search API calls are proposed:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Dataset\")`\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"update\", \"Dataset\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide detailed insights into how the `Dataset` class handles updates, especially in relation to chunked Dask `DataArray` objects, which is central to the reported issue.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\nWithout the results from the corrected search API calls, we do not have enough information to definitively identify the bug locations. However, based on the issue description and the partial context we have, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the bug could be located in:\n\n- **Buggy files and methods**: The implementation of the `update` method within the `Dataset` class could be the primary location of the bug, especially if it inadvertently triggers an eager evaluation of chunked Dask arrays or fails to preserve the chunked structure during the update process. The file containing this class and method would be the primary target for further investigation and patching."
