Based on the provided context and the issue described, the problem seems to be that the `viewcode` extension is still generating pages for ePub even when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. The provided `doctree_read` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` correctly checks the condition but the issue might be elsewhere in how the viewcode pages are being generated or linked. However, without explicit evidence of a bug in the provided method or other parts of the code, the best approach is to ensure the conditional logic around `viewcode_enable_epub` is correctly implemented and respected throughout the extension.

Given the information, it seems the implementation in `doctree_read` is correct for the purpose of the setting `viewcode_enable_epub`. Therefore, without further evidence of where the actual bug lies (e.g., in the page generation process, in how links to viewcode pages are inserted, or in the ePub generation process itself), suggesting a specific patch is challenging.

However, I can provide a hypothetical patch that ensures the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting is respected in the `doctree_read` method, even though the provided code already does this. This serves as an example of how to structure a patch if a specific area needing adjustment was identified.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/viewcode.py</file>
<original>if app.builder.name.startswith("epub") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
    return</original>
<patched># Assuming the issue was that this condition was not correctly skipping the viewcode page generation
# for ePub when viewcode_enable_epub is False, but the original code seems correct.
# Hypothetical patch without a specific bug identified in the provided method:
if app.builder.name.startswith("epub"):
    if not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
        app.info('Skipping viewcode page generation for ePub as viewcode_enable_epub is False')
        return</patched>
```

This modification doesn't change the logic but adds a logging statement for clarity. It's important to note that without identifying a specific bug in the logic or elsewhere in the code that contradicts the intended behavior of respecting the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting, creating a meaningful patch is speculative. The original implementation already appears to correctly handle the setting by returning early from the `doctree_read` function if generating ePub and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.
