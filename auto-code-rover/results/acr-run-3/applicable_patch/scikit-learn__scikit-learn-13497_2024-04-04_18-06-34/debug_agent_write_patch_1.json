        "content": "The issue describes a problem within the `_estimate_mi` function, which is part of the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file in the codebase. The function is designed to estimate mutual information between the features and the target. The parameters of interest in this context are `X`, `y`, and `discrete_features`, with a particular focus on how `discrete_features` is handled.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet, we can see that `discrete_features` can be specified in three different ways:\n1. As a string `'auto'`, which is the default value. In this case, `discrete_features` is determined based on whether `X` is sparse or not. If `X` is sparse, `discrete_features` is set to `True`, otherwise it is set to `False`.\n2. As a boolean value, which explicitly specifies whether all features should be considered discrete (`True`) or continuous (`False`).\n3. As an array-like object, which can either be a boolean mask with shape `(n_features,)` indicating which features are discrete, or an array of indices specifying the discrete features.\n\nThe issue points out that comparing `discrete_features` directly to the string `'auto'` could lead to errors in future versions of numpy, especially since `discrete_features` can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask. This comparison is indeed found in the line:\n```python\nif discrete_features == 'auto':\n    discrete_features = issparse(X)\n```\n\nAdditionally, the issue suggests that the function might not have been thoroughly tested with `discrete_features` values other than `'auto'`, which could potentially overlook bugs or unexpected behavior when `discrete_features` is an array or a boolean mask.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to:\n1. Refactor the comparison of `discrete_features` to `'auto'` to ensure future compatibility with numpy and to handle different types of inputs correctly.\n2. Ensure that there are test cases covering scenarios where `discrete_features` is not `'auto'`, including when it's a boolean value and when it's an array-like object specifying discrete features either by indices or by a boolean mask."
