```python
<file>sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py</file>
<original>if discrete_features == 'auto':
    discrete_features = issparse(X)</original>
<patched>if isinstance(discrete_features, str) and discrete_features == 'auto':
    discrete_features = issparse(X)</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the comparison of `discrete_features` to the string `'auto'` is only performed if `discrete_features` is indeed a string. This prevents potential future errors with numpy versions where comparing strings with arrays could lead to unexpected results. This change maintains the original functionality while improving the robustness of the type checking.
