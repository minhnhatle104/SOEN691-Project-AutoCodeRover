<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>        method = builtin_str(method)</original>
<patched>        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('utf-8')
        else:
            method = str(method)</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by first checking if the `method` variable is an instance of `bytes`. If it is, it decodes the `method` to a UTF-8 string, ensuring compatibility with Python 3's string handling. If `method` is not a byte string, it simply converts it to a string using Python's built-in `str()` function. This approach avoids the problem of converting a byte string like `b'GET'` into the incorrect literal string `"b'GET'"` and ensures that the `method` variable is always a properly formatted string.
