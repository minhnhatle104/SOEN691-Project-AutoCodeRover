              + r", ".join(self._print(el) for el in printset)

<patched>        return (r"\left["
              + r", ".join(self._print(el) for el in printset)
              + r"\right]")</patched>
```

Explanation:
The issue was with the LaTeX rendering of sequences where the square brackets were being escaped (`\left\[` and `\right\]`), which is not necessary and causes rendering issues in Jupyter notebooks. The patch corrects this by removing the backslashes, thus ensuring that the square brackets are not escaped in the LaTeX output. This change should allow the sequence to be rendered correctly in Jupyter markdown cells.
