Given the context and the nature of the issue, the patch would aim to ensure that the path resolution for test failure reporting accurately reflects the original test context, including the original working directory, regardless of any temporary changes made during test execution. Since the specific mechanism for test failure reporting and path resolution was not directly identified, this patch will focus on enhancing the `MonkeyPatch` class to track directory changes and provide a way to resolve paths relative to the original working directory.

This patch introduces a `_new_cwd` attribute to track the new working directory after a change. This attribute could be used by other parts of pytest (especially those involved in test failure reporting) to resolve paths relative to the original working directory. However, without specific insights into those mechanisms
