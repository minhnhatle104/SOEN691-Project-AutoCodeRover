This patch ensures that the `xy` array can accommodate an additional element before attempting to assign a value to `xy[4]`. It checks the length of `xy` and appends a placeholder element if necessary. This approach prevents the `IndexError` while preserving the intended functionality of setting the slider's value and updating its graphical representation.
