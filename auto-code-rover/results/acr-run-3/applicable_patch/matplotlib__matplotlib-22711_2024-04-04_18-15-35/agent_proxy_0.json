Given the information provided in the issue, the following API calls would be relevant:\n\n1. **Search for the `RangeSlider` class**: This will help us understand the overall structure of the class, its inheritance, and other methods that might interact with `set_val`.\n   - `search_class(\"RangeSlider\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `set_val` method within the `RangeSlider` class**: Since the issue is directly related to this method, getting more context on how it's implemented and any related comments or documentation within the class will be helpful.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_val\", \"RangeSlider\")`\n\n3. **Search for the specific code snippet that is causing the issue**: This will help us understand if the problematic line of code is used elsewhere or if there are similar patterns that might also need attention.\n   - `search_code(\"xy[4] = val[0], .25\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem and how the `set_val` method is supposed to work within the `RangeSlider` widget, allowing for a more informed approach to patching the bug."
