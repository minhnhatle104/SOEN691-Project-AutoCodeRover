These modifications address the race condition by handling the `FileNotFoundError` exception gracefully. In the `has_key` method, the exception is caught and handled, ensuring that the method returns `False` if the file does not exist at the time of opening. This change removes the need for a separate existence check before opening the file, thus closing the race condition window.

In the `_is_expired` method, a similar approach is taken to handle the case where the file is deleted by another process or thread right before the `_delete` call. This ensures that the cache backend does not crash due to an unhandled `FileNotFoundError`.
