We also need to understand the `_is_expired` method since it's mentioned as part of the race condition problem. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"FileBasedCache\")`: This will help us understand the overall structure of the `FileBasedCache` class and its methods, which is crucial for addressing the issue.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"has_key\", \"FileBasedCache\")`: This will give us detailed information about the `has_key` method implementation, which is directly involved in the race condition issue.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_is_expired\", \"FileBasedCache\")`: Since the issue description mentions that `_is_expired` can delete the file, leading to the race condition, understanding its implementation is crucial for devising a solution."
