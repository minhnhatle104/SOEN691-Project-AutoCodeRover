Specifically, we need to look into the classes and methods responsible for generating LaTeX code for matrix symbols and their indexed elements. Given the information in the issue, it seems relevant to explore the `MatrixSymbol` class and how the LaTeX representation for matrix multiplication, especially when indexed, is created. \n\nLet's start by searching for the `MatrixSymbol` class and the method responsible for generating the LaTeX representation, which could likely be part of a more general LaTeX printing functionality.\n\n1. `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`: This will help us understand the `MatrixSymbol` class structure and any relevant methods it might have for LaTeX generation.\n2. `search_method(\"latex\")`: Since the issue involves the generation of a LaTeX string, we need to find where and how the `latex` method is implemented across the project. This method is likely responsible for converting symbolic expressions to LaTeX code.\n\nThese searches will provide a starting point for understanding how the LaTeX representation is generated and where the issue might be arising from."
