            "content": "- **Do we need more context**: Yes, to precisely identify the cause of the issue and propose a solution, we need to investigate how matrix multiplication is printed in LaTeX, focusing on the generation and naming of temporary indices in the summation representation. The following search API calls are necessary:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"_print_MatMul\", \"LatexPrinter\")`: This will help us understand how the LaTeX code for matrix multiplication is generated, which is crucial for identifying the source of the double subscript issue.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: Based on the current analysis, the bug is likely related to how matrix multiplication involving indexed expressions is printed in LaTeX. While the exact location is not yet identified, it is suspected to be within the method responsible for printing matrix multiplication expressions (`_print_MatMul`) in the `LatexPrinter` class, located in `sympy/printing/latex.py`."
