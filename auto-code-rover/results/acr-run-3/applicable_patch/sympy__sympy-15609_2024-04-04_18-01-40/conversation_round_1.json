This class includes methods that are likely relevant to the issue, such as `__new__` for object creation, `_entry` which might be involved in accessing matrix elements, and properties like `shape` and `name` which provide matrix dimensions and name respectively. However, there's no direct indication of LaTeX printing functionality within this class itself.\n\n2. **LaTeX Printing Functionality (sympy/printing/latex.py)**:\n   - The `latex` function is responsible for converting various expressions, including matrices, into their LaTeX string representations. This function is highly configurable with a wide range of parameters that control the formatting of the output string. The actual conversion process delegates to the `LatexPrinter` class, which uses the provided settings and the expression to generate the LaTeX code.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to arise from the way matrix multiplication and indexing are translated into LaTeX by the `LatexPrinter` class, which is invoked by the `latex` function. The problematic LaTeX code (`\\sum_{i_{1}=0}^{k - 1} M_{i, _i_1} N_{_i_1, j}`) suggests that there's a specific handling of indexed matrix multiplication that results in an incorrect subscript notation (`_i_1`).\n\nTo address the issue, we need to look into how the `LatexPrinter` class handles the printing of indexed matrix expressions, particularly focusing on the generation of subscripts in the case of matrix multiplication. Since the `latex` function delegates the printing to `LatexPrinter`, the next logical step would be to examine the implementation of matrix-related printing within the `LatexPrinter` class to identify and correct the handling of subscripts for indexed matrix multiplication.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Investigate the `LatexPrinter` class, specifically methods that are responsible for printing matrix expressions and handling subscripts during matrix multiplication.\n- Identify the logic that leads to the generation of incorrect subscript notation (`_i_1`) and devise a patch to ensure that valid LaTeX code is produced for indexed matrix expressions."
