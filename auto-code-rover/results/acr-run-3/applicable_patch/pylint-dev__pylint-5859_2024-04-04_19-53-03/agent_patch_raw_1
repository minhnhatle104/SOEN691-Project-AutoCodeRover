To address the issue where pylint's `--notes` option ignores note tags that are entirely punctuation, we need to ensure that the regular expression pattern used to match note tags in comments is capable of recognizing these punctuation-based tags. The provided code snippet does not show the construction of `_fixme_pattern`, which is crucial for understanding how note tags are matched. However, based on the description of the issue, the problem likely lies in how this pattern is defined or used.

Assuming `_fixme_pattern` is constructed elsewhere to include the note tags specified in the `--notes` option, a potential fix would involve ensuring that punctuation characters in note tags are properly escaped or handled so they are recognized by the regular expression search. Since the specific construction of `_fixme_pattern` is not shown, I will provide a hypothetical patch that ensures punctuation in note tags is considered when constructing the regular expression pattern for matching note tags in comments.

# modification 1
```python
<file>pylint/checkers/misc.py</file>
<original>match = self._fixme_pattern.search("#" + comment_text.lower())</original>
<patched># Assuming _fixme_pattern is constructed based on self.config.notes
# Ensure punctuation in note tags is properly escaped when constructing the regex pattern.
# This is a conceptual patch and might need adjustments based on actual _fixme_pattern construction logic.

import re

# Example function to escape punctuation in note tags for regex pattern
def escape_punctuation_for_regex(note_tags):
    escaped_tags = [re.escape(tag) for tag in note_tags]
    pattern = "|".join(escaped_tags)
    return re.compile(pattern, re.IGNORECASE)

# Hypothetical place where _fixme_pattern is constructed or updated based on self.config.notes
self._fixme_pattern = escape_punctuation_for_regex(self.config.notes)

# No change in the line of code that uses _fixme_pattern, but it's now constructed to handle punctuation
match = self._fixme_pattern.search("#" + comment_text.lower())</patched>
```

This modification assumes that `_fixme_pattern` is dynamically constructed based on `self.config.notes` and suggests introducing a method to escape punctuation in note tags before constructing the regex pattern. The actual implementation may vary depending on how `_fixme_pattern` is initially defined and used within the `pylint` codebase. The key is to ensure that punctuation characters in note tags are not treated as special regex characters but as literal characters to be matched in comments.
