        "content": "Based on the search result, the issue is located within the `LatexPrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, specifically in the `_print_Function` method. The code snippet provided shows the initialization of the `inv_trig_table` array, which currently includes `\"asin\"`, `\"acos\"`, `\"atan\"`, and `\"acot\"` as its elements. This array is used to determine if a function is an inverse trigonometric function and, if so, how it should be printed based on the `inv_trig_style` setting.\n\nThe issue reported is that the full names for the inverse trigonometric functions `acsc` and `asec` are not supported when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is used. The suggested fix is to add `\"acsc\"` and `\"asec\"` to the `inv_trig_table` array to ensure they are recognized as inverse trigonometric functions and handled appropriately.\n\nTo proceed with a fix, we should:\n1. Update the `inv_trig_table` array to include `\"acsc\"` and `\"asec\"`.\n2. Ensure that the logic following this array's initialization correctly handles these additional functions when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is specified.\n3. Review any related code to ensure that adding these functions does not introduce any side effects or require additional changes elsewhere in the `LatexPrinter` class or its methods.\n\nGiven the context and the suggested fix, it seems straightforward to proceed with updating the code. However, it would be prudent to also search for any references to `inv_trig_style` or the handling of inverse trigonometric functions elsewhere in the codebase to ensure comprehensive coverage and to verify that no additional updates are needed."
