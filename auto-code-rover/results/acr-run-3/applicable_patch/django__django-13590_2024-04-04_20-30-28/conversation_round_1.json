This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the Django project's codebase, we can analyze the issue and the relevant code to understand the problem and formulate a solution.\n\n### Issue Summary\nThe issue arises when upgrading a Django project from version 2.2 to 3.0. Specifically, the problem occurs when named tuples are used as arguments to `__range` queryset filters. In Django 3.0, this results in a `TypeError` because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements but fails when dealing with named tuples. The error message mentioned is: `TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'`.\n\n### Analyzing the `resolve_lookup_value` Method\nThe `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class has the following relevant code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef resolve_lookup_value(self, value, can_reuse, allow_joins):\n    if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):\n        value = value.resolve_expression(\n            self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,\n        )\n    elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n        # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need\n        # to be resolved independently.\n        return type(value)(\n            self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n            for sub_value in value\n        )\n    return value\n```\n\n### Problem Identification\nThe issue occurs in the `elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):` block. When `value` is a named tuple, the method attempts to create a new instance of the named tuple by passing an iterator (generator expression) to its constructor. However, named tuples expect individual arguments for each field, not a single iterator, leading to the `TypeError`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nTo resolve this issue, we need to modify the way named tuples are reconstructed in the `resolve_lookup_value` method. Specifically, we should expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor when dealing with named tuples. This can be achieved by checking if `value` is an instance of a named tuple and, if so, using the `*` operator to unpack the iterator into the constructor.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Confirm whether there's a straightforward way to detect named tuples in this context, considering Python's standard library provides the `collections.namedtuple` function and `typing.NamedTuple` class for creating named tuples.\n- Modify the `resolve_lookup_value` method to handle named tuples correctly by unpacking the iterator.\n- Test the changes to ensure that named tuples are now handled correctly without causing a `TypeError` and that the functionality remains consistent for other iterable types.\n\nThis analysis provides a clear direction for addressing the issue. The next step would involve implementing the proposed solution in the codebase."
