            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about where and how the error occurs within the Django project's codebase. The issue specifically mentions a problem with named tuples used as arguments to `__range` queryset filters after upgrading from version 2.2 to 3.0. The error is traced back to the `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` method, which attempts to reconstitute a tuple but fails with named tuples due to the way it handles iterators.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls will be useful to gather the necessary context to understand and eventually patch the issue:\n\n1. Search for the `Query` class to find its location in the codebase:\n   - `search_class(\"Query\")`\n\n2. Search for the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class to understand its implementation and how it handles tuples:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"resolve_lookup_value\", \"Query\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to locate the relevant sections of the codebase where the issue originates, providing a foundation for proposing a fix."
