            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `ModelChoiceField` and `ModelMultipleChoiceField` classes handle validation and error messages, especially in scenarios where an invalid choice is provided. Given the information in the issue, it seems pertinent to look into the validation method(s) that these classes use to raise `ValidationError` with the error messages. Since the issue specifically mentions the handling of invalid choices and the need to show the value of the invalid choice in the error message, we should start by looking into methods related to validation and error handling in these classes.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be useful to gather more context:\n\n1. **Search for the `ModelChoiceField` class**: This will help us understand the structure of the class and identify any validation methods or error handling mechanisms it employs.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelChoiceField\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` class**: Similar to the `ModelChoiceField`, this will give us insights into how this class is structured and how it might differ in handling validation and errors.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelMultipleChoiceField\")`\n\n3. **Search for validation methods in `ModelChoiceField`**: Since the issue mentions that `ModelChoiceField` does not show the value of the invalid choice when raising a validation error, it's crucial to look into how validation is performed in this class.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"validate\", \"ModelChoiceField\")`\n\n4. **Search for validation methods in `ModelMultipleChoiceField`**: To understand how this class handles validation and whether it shares the same issue or has a different mechanism.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"validate\", \"ModelMultipleChoiceField\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how these classes handle validation and manage error messages, especially in relation to invalid choices. This information will be crucial for devising a patch to address the issue."
