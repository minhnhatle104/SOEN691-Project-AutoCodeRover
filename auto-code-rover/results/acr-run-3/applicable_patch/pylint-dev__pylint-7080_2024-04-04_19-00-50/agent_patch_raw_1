This modification ensures that the `ignore-paths` setting is correctly applied relative to the root directory being recursively searched. By joining the base directory (`something`) with each `ignored_path` from `self.config.ignore_paths`, the path comparison in `_is_ignored_file` function will correctly recognize and ignore the specified paths. This adjustment addresses the issue where `ignore-paths` were not being respected during recursive file discovery.
