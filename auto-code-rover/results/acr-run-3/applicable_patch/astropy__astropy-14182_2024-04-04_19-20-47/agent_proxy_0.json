            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the classes and methods involved in the traceback and the feature request. Specifically, we should look into the `RST` class since the error message indicates that it does not accept `header_rows` as a keyword argument. Additionally, understanding how `header_rows` is handled in other formats like `ascii.fixed_width` could provide insights into how to implement similar functionality for the `ascii.rst` format. \n\nLet's start by investigating the following:\n\n1. The `RST` class to understand its current capabilities and constructor signature.\n2. The method or class responsible for handling the `header_rows` argument in the `ascii.fixed_width` format to see how it's implemented there.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"RST\")`: To get more information about the `RST` class and its constructor.\n- `search_code(\"header_rows\"): To find how and where `header_rows` is being used across the codebase, especially in relation to table formatting."
