Therefore, no additional search API calls are necessary at this moment.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: \n\nThe buggy file and method identified from the analysis are:\n\n1. **File**: `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n   - **Method**: `handle`\n     - This method currently sets `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`. According to the issue, it needs to be updated to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to determine whether to wrap the output in `BEGIN/COMMIT` based on the database's support for transactional DDL.\n\nThe analysis also suggests that a new test should be added to verify this behavior, but the existing test structure in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` provides a clear guideline for implementing this."
