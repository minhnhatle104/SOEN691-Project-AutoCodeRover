This is confirmed by the search result from `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, indicating that `sqlmigrate` is a command.\n\n2. **Use of `self.output_transaction`**: The search results revealed two snippets where `self.output_transaction` is used.

The second snippet from `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` shows that `output_transaction` is set based on whether the migration is atomic. This aligns with the issue description, which suggests that the current logic only considers `migration.atomic` and needs to be updated to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\n3. **Usage of `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`**: The search for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` returned 8 matches across various files, indicating that this feature check is used in different parts of the codebase, including schema operations and other management commands.

This test ensures that transaction wrappers aren't shown for non-atomic migrations, which is relevant to the issue at hand.
