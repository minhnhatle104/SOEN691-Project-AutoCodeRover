        "content": "The provided code snippet from the `uniq` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file shows that `uniq` is designed to yield unique elements from a given sequence (`seq`) as an iterator. The function works by maintaining a set of seen elements and yields elements that have not been seen before. If a `TypeError` is encountered (which can happen if the elements of the sequence are unhashable and cannot be added to a set), it falls back to using a list (`result`) to keep track of seen elements and recursively calls itself to handle the rest of the sequence.\n\nThe issue reported is related to the behavior of `uniq` when the input sequence (`seq`) is modified during iteration. Specifically, the problem arises when `uniq` is used in a loop that modifies the input list, leading to unexpected behavior because the size of the list changes during iteration. The user suggests that a similar error to what Python raises when a dictionary or set is modified during iteration (i.e., `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`) should be raised by `uniq` to prevent silent failures or incorrect results.\n\nTo address this issue, a potential solution involves modifying the `uniq` function to check if the size of the input sequence changes during iteration and, if so, raise a `RuntimeError`. This would involve tracking the size of the input sequence at the start of the function and comparing it to the size after iteration is complete. If the sizes differ, it indicates that the sequence was modified during iteration, and an error should be raised to alert the user to this issue.\n\nGiven the current implementation of `uniq`, modifications will need to be careful to maintain the function's ability to handle both hashable and unhashable elements, as well as its recursive handling of sequences that cause a `TypeError` when elements are added to a set. The solution should also consider performance implications, as adding additional checks could potentially impact the performance of the function, especially for large sequences."
