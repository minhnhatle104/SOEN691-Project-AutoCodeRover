This change aims to improve the logging output by providing more context about the source of each log message.\n\n```python\n<file>src/_pytest/logging.py</file>\n<original>DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s"</original>\n<patched>DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s"</patched>\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` string to include the module name (`%(name)s`) before the filename and line number, separated by colons, which aligns with the suggested format in the issue. This change will make the log messages more informative by providing the module name, which can be especially useful in larger projects where the same filename might exist in multiple modules.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
