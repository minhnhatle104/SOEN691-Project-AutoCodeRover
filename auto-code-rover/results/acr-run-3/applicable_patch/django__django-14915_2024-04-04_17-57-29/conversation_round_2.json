If it's part of Django, we might find relevant changes in the Django 3.1 release notes. If it's custom, we need to look at how it's implemented.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ModelChoiceIteratorValue\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `create_option` method in the entire codebase**: Since the issue occurs within this method, we need to see all its occurrences to understand if it's overridden or used in multiple places, which could affect how we approach the patch.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"create_option\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for usage of `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` in relation to `create_option`**: This will help us understand how `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` is being used within the context of `create_option` and might give us clues on why it's not hashable.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"ModelChoiceIteratorValue\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive overview of the issue at hand, allowing us to devise a suitable patch."

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have gathered some crucial context regarding the issue with `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` not being hashable after upgrading to Django 3.1. Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n1. **`ModelChoiceIteratorValue` Class**: The class is defined in `django/forms/models.py` and includes an `__init__` method, a `__str__` method, and an `__eq__` method. Notably, there's no `__hash__` method defined, which is crucial for an object to be hashable. The absence of a `__hash__` method means instances of `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` cannot be used as keys in a dictionary or elements in a set, which seems to be the root cause of the issue.\n\n2. **`create_option` Method**: This method is found in `django/forms/widgets.py` and also appears in tests within `tests/model_forms/test_modelchoicefield.py`. The issue occurs within this method, specifically when attempting to use `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances in a context that requires them to be hashable (e.g., checking if a value is in a dictionary).\n\n3. **Usage of `ModelChoiceIteratorValue`**: The class and its instances are referenced in both `django/forms/models.py` and `tests/model_forms/test_modelchoicefield.py`. This indicates that `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` is used within Django's form handling, particularly in model choice fields, which aligns with the issue's context involving select widget options.\n\nGiven this context, the problem seems to stem from the fact that `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances are not hashable due to the lack of a `__hash__` method. This becomes an issue when such instances are used as dictionary keys or checked against a dictionary's keys, as seen in the `create_option` method where the error occurs.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to ensure that `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances are hashable. This can be achieved by implementing a `__hash__` method in the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class. The `__hash__` method should return a hash value that uniquely identifies the instance, typically based on attributes that are also considered in the `__eq__` method to maintain consistency between equality and hashability.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting a patch to add a `__hash__` method to the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class, ensuring it aligns with the existing `__eq__` method to maintain the hash-equality invariant."
