            "content": "To address the issue effectively, it's crucial to understand the current implementation of the `Request` class, specifically the `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method. Given the issue description, it seems that the handling of the `hooks` argument in the `Request.__init__` method and possibly the implementation of `register_hook` are the primary areas of concern. Let's proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Request\")`: This will help us locate the `Request` class within the codebase, which is central to the issue.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"register_hook\", \"Request\")`: Since the issue mentions that the current workaround involves calling `.register_hook()` multiple times, understanding its implementation will be crucial.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Request\")`: This will provide insight into how the `hooks` argument is currently processed during object initialization, which is directly related to the problem described."
