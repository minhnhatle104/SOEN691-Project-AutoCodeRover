            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)</original>
<patched>        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            if isinstance(v, list):
                for hook in v:
                    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)
            else:
                self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)</patched>
```

This modification checks if the value associated with each key in the `hooks` dictionary is a list. If it is, it iterates over the list, registering each hook function individually. If not, it registers the hook as before. This allows for both single functions and lists of functions to be passed as values in the `hooks` dictionary.
