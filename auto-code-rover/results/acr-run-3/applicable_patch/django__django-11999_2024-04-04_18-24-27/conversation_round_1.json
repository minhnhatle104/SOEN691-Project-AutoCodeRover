One is found in `tests/migrations/test_state.py` and seems to be a simple inheritance test case, not directly related to the issue at hand.\n   - The other `FooBar` class is located in `tests/model_fields/tests.py` and is a Django model that defines a field `foo_bar` with choices and a custom method `get_foo_bar_display`. This class is directly relevant to the issue described.\n\n2. **`get_foo_bar_display` Method**:\n   - The method `get_foo_bar_display` is overridden in the `FooBar` class within `tests/model_fields/tests.py`, returning a hardcoded string `'something'`. This matches the issue description where the expectation is to override the default behavior of `get_FOO_display()` to return a custom string.\n   - Another occurrence of the `get_foo_bar_display` method is found in the `GetFieldDisplayTests` class within the same file (`tests/model_fields/tests.py`), which suggests that there might be a test case specifically designed to test the behavior of this method.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to be related to the inability to override the `get_FOO_display()` method in Django models starting from version 2.2, which works differently than in version 2.1 as per the user's report. The user expects to override this method to return a custom string instead of the default behavior, which is to return the display value corresponding to the model's field choices.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The issue might be related to changes in Django's handling of model methods or the choices field in version 2.2+. It could be a change in the method resolution order, or a change in how Django models introspect methods for fields with choices.\n- Since the method seems to be correctly overridden in the codebase, the problem might not be with the method definition itself but with how Django versions 2.2+ interact with overridden methods of this nature.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Review Django 2.2 release notes or documentation related to model fields and method overriding to identify any changes that could affect this behavior.\n- Verify if there are any tests specifically addressing the `get_foo_bar_display` method's behavior in newer Django versions, as indicated by the presence of a method with the same name in the `GetFieldDisplayTests` class.\n- Consider testing the overridden method in a minimal Django 2.2+ setup to isolate the issue and ensure it's not influenced by other project-specific configurations or customizations.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for understanding the issue and outlines potential next steps for resolving it."
