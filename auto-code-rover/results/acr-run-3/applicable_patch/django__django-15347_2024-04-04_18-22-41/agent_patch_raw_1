```python
<file>django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py</file>
<original>            if obj.extra_tags:
                message.append(obj.extra_tags)</original>
<patched>            # Ensure extra_tags is included in the serialized output, even if it's an empty string
            message.append(obj.extra_tags if obj.extra_tags is not None else '')</patched>
```

This modification ensures that `extra_tags` is always included in the serialized message, even when it's an empty string, by explicitly checking if `extra_tags` is not `None` before appending it to the message list. This change addresses the issue where an empty string for `extra_tags` was not being serialized, leading to it being interpreted as `None` upon deserialization.
