            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` classes handle the serialization and deserialization of the `extra_tags` attribute of a `Message` object. Specifically, we need to examine the implementation of the encoding and decoding process to identify where the conversion of an empty string to `None` occurs and how to correctly handle this case.\n\nGiven the information in the issue, the following API calls would be necessary to gather more context and identify potential areas for the patch:\n\n1. **Search for the `Message` class**: This will help us understand the structure of a `Message` object, particularly how the `extra_tags` attribute is defined and used.\n   - `search_class(\"Message\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `MessageEncoder` class**: Since the issue mentions that the problem occurs during serialization, examining the `MessageEncoder` class will allow us to see how it serializes `Message` objects, especially the `extra_tags` attribute.\n   - `search_class(\"MessageEncoder\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `MessageDecoder` class**: Similarly, since the issue occurs during deserialization as well, we need to look at how the `MessageDecoder` class handles the deserialization of `Message` objects and how it treats the `extra_tags` attribute.\n   - `search_class(\"MessageDecoder\")`\n\n4. **Search for the encoding method in the `MessageEncoder` class**: This will provide insight into the specific method responsible for encoding `Message` objects, which is where the issue might be originating.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"encode\", \"MessageEncoder\")`\n\n5. **Search for the decoding method in the `MessageDecoder` class**: This will help us understand how `Message` objects are decoded and how the `extra_tags` attribute is being handled during this process.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"decode\", \"MessageDecoder\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive view of how `Message` objects are serialized and deserialized, and where the conversion of `extra_tags` from an empty string to `None` might be happening. With this information, we can then proceed to develop a patch to fix the issue."
