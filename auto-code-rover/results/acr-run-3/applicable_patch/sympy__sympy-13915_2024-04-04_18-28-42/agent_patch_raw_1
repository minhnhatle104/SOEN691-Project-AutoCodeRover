    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Handle cases where limit evaluation raises ZeroDivisionError
        return Undefined
# Added try-except block to catch ZeroDivisionError and return Undefined for cases
# where the limit evaluation directly leads to a division by zero.</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the issue by adding checks and handling for cases that could lead to undefined expressions during substitution and limit calculations. The first modification ensures that substitutions that do not change the expression are skipped, potentially avoiding undefined results. The second modification adds error handling for limit calculations that result in division by zero, returning an `Undefined` symbol instead of raising an unhandled exception.
