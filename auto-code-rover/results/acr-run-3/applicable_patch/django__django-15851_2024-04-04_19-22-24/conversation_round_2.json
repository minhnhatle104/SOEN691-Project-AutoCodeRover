The issue suggests that the order of arguments passed to `psql` is incorrect, with the database name not being placed at the end of the argument list as expected by `psql`.\n\nGiven this, we should start by locating the implementation of the `dbshell` command. Since the issue mentions `./manage.py dbshell`, it's likely part of a Django or Django-like framework where management commands are defined in a specific structure.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. **Search for the `dbshell` command implementation**: Since `dbshell` is likely a method or a function that handles the database shell command, we can start by searching for it in the entire codebase.\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"dbshell\")`\n\n2. **Search for code related to argument construction**: The issue description points to a problem with how arguments are passed to `psql`, specifically that the database name should come last. It's useful to search for any code snippets that might be constructing this command line.\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"psql\")`\n\nThese searches should help us locate the relevant parts of the codebase where the issue resides and provide a starting point for developing a patch."

However, the search for `\"psql\"` yielded more fruitful results, indicating where PostgreSQL-related command-line interactions are likely handled within the project. \n\nThe files of interest are:\n\n1. **django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py**: This file contains 2 matches for `psql` and is likely where the PostgreSQL database client configuration and command-line interaction are implemented. Given the context of the issue, this file is a prime candidate for containing the code that constructs the command line for the `dbshell` command.\n\n2. **django/db/backends/base/client.py**: With 1 match for `psql`, this file might contain base functionality for database clients across different database backends. It's possible that this file defines a generic structure or method that is overridden or extended by the PostgreSQL-specific client implementation in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`.\n\n3. **tests/dbshell/test_postgresql.py**: Containing 10 matches, this file is clearly focused on testing the PostgreSQL `dbshell` functionality. While it might not contain the implementation of the issue, it could provide insights into how the `dbshell` command is expected to work and how arguments are supposed to be passed to `psql`, which could be useful for validating any patches made to fix the issue.\n\nGiven this context, the next step should involve a closer examination of the `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` file to understand how it constructs the command line for `psql` and to identify where the ordering of arguments might need to be corrected. Additionally, reviewing the `django/db/backends/base/client.py` could provide insights into the base implementation that the PostgreSQL client extends or modifies.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n\n1. **Review the PostgreSQL client implementation**:\n   - `search_code_in_file(code_str=\"psql\", file_path=\"django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py\")`\n\n2. **Understand the base client implementation** (if necessary based on findings from the PostgreSQL client review):\n   - `search_code_in_file(code_str=\"psql\", file_path=\"django/db/backends/base/client.py\")`\n\nThese steps will help us pinpoint the exact location and manner in which the `dbshell` command line is constructed, and how we can modify it to ensure the database name is placed at the end of the argument list as required by `psql`."

        "content": "The search results from `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` provide valuable insights into how the PostgreSQL `dbshell` functionality is implemented within the project. Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n1. **DatabaseClient Class**: This class extends `BaseDatabaseClient` and specifies `psql` as the `executable_name`. This indicates that the class is designed to interface with PostgreSQL's command-line tool (`psql`) for database interactions.\n\n2. **settings_to_cmd_args_env Method**: This method likely plays a crucial role in constructing the command-line arguments for invoking `psql`. However, the snippet provided does not include the body of the method, which is where the logic for arranging the command-line arguments (including the database name and additional parameters) would reside. This method is a potential location for the bug, as it is responsible for preparing the command-line arguments based on the provided settings and parameters.\n\n3. **runshell Method**: The snippet shows that this method is responsible for handling the invocation of `psql`, including setting up a signal handler to allow SIGINT (interrupt signal) to be passed to `psql` to abort queries. The call to `super().runshell(parameters)` suggests that it delegates part of its functionality to the parent class's `runshell` method, passing along any parameters it receives. The method itself does not directly construct or manipulate the command-line arguments but is involved in the execution flow.\n\nBased on this analysis, the bug is likely related to how the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method constructs the command-line arguments for `psql`. Specifically, the issue described indicates that the database name is not being placed at the end of the argument list, which is a requirement for `psql` to correctly interpret additional command-line options.\n\n**Bug Locations**:\n- **Buggy File**: `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`\n- **Buggy Methods**:\n  - `settings_to_cmd_args_env`: This method is a likely candidate for where the command-line arguments are incorrectly ordered. A patch would need to ensure that the database name is appended to the end of the argument list after any additional parameters.\n  - While `runshell` is involved in the execution, the description and snippets do not indicate that the bug is within this method. However, understanding its implementation is crucial for context.\n\nTo proceed with a patch, we would need to see the implementation details of `settings_to_cmd_args_env` to understand how it currently constructs the command-line arguments and to modify it accordingly. The goal would be to adjust the logic so that any additional parameters are placed before the database name in the argument list."
