        "content": "<issue>autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\nexpr = 1.0\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\n```python\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\n```\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\n```C\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\ndouble autofunc_result;\nautofunc_result = 1.0;\nreturn autofunc_result;\n}\n```\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\n# now output depends on x\nexpr = x[0,0]\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n</issue>"

It supports different backends (`f2py`, `cython`, etc.) and languages (`C`, `F95`), and it can handle additional compilation and linking arguments.\n    - The function allows specifying arguments (`args`) for the generated function, which is crucial for our issue since the problem arises when array arguments are not used in the expression.\n    - The `autowrap` function dynamically selects a code wrapper class based on the specified backend. For the `cython` backend, it uses `CythonCodeWrapper`.\n\n2. **Cython Backend Handling**:\n    - The handling of the `cython` backend is determined by the `CythonCodeWrapper` class, which is selected based on the `backend` parameter. This class is likely responsible for generating the C function signature and thus is a critical area to investigate for the issue at hand.\n    - The example in the issue description and the test case found in `sympy/external/tests/test_autowrap.py` both explicitly specify `backend='cython'`. This confirms that specifying the backend as `cython` is a common use case and is supported by the `autowrap` function.\n\n3. **Potential Areas for Investigation**:\n    - The generation of the C function signature, especially how array arguments are handled when they are not used in the expression. This likely involves the `CythonCodeWrapper` class or the code generation process that it triggers.\n    - How the `args` parameter is processed and passed to the code generation backend. Since the issue arises when an array argument is not used in the expression, there might be a mismatch or oversight in how unused arguments are handled.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n    - Investigate the `CythonCodeWrapper` class to understand how it generates C function signatures and how it processes the `args` parameter, especially for array arguments.\n    - Review the code generation process for the `cython` backend to identify where the logic might fail to correctly handle array arguments that are not used in the expression.\n\nGiven the information we have, the next logical step would be to look into the `CythonCodeWrapper` class and any related code generation logic that handles the `args` parameter and the generation of C function signatures for the `cython` backend."

        "content": "With the details of the `CythonCodeWrapper` class now available, we can delve deeper into how the `autowrap` function with the `cython` backend handles the generation of C code, particularly focusing on function signatures and array arguments. The `CythonCodeWrapper` class is a key component in this process, as it is responsible for wrapping the generated C code into a Cython module that can be called from Python.\n\n### Key Components of `CythonCodeWrapper`:\n\n1. **Setup Template**:\n    - The setup template is used for compiling the Cython module. It includes configurations for including directories, library directories, libraries, and extra compile/link arguments. This is a standard setup for compiling Cython modules but doesn't directly impact the generation of function signatures.\n\n2. **Pyx Imports and Headers**:\n    - The class defines imports and headers for the `.pyx` file, including NumPy imports, which are crucial for handling array arguments. This indicates that the wrapper is designed to work with NumPy arrays, aligning with the issue description.\n\n3. **Function Generation**:\n    - The `pyx_func` template outlines how the Cython function is defined. It includes placeholders for the function name, argument string, declarations, and the body. This is a critical area for our issue, as the correct handling of array arguments in the argument string and declarations is essential for generating the correct C function signature.\n\n4. **Argument Handling**:\n    - Methods like `_partition_args`, `_prototype_arg`, `_declare_arg`, and `_call_arg` suggest that the class has a detailed mechanism for handling different types of arguments, including potentially distinguishing between scalar and array arguments.\n    - These methods are likely involved in generating the correct C function signature by determining how each argument should be declared and used within the Cython function.\n\n### Analysis and Next Steps:\n\nGiven the issue's description and the role of `CythonCodeWrapper`, the bug likely resides in how array arguments are handled when they do not appear in the final expression. Specifically, the methods responsible for generating the argument string and declarations (`_declare_arg`, `_prototype_arg`, etc.) may not be correctly identifying or handling array arguments that are unused in the expression. This could lead to generating a scalar (`double`) argument in the C function signature instead of an array pointer (`double*`), as reported.\n\nTo address the issue, a closer examination of the following areas within `CythonCodeWrapper` is needed:\n\n- **Argument Declaration and Prototype Generation**: How array arguments are identified and declared in the generated Cython code. This involves the `_declare_arg` and `_prototype_arg` methods.\n- **Function Signature Generation**: How the overall function signature, including argument types and return type, is generated, particularly for functions with array arguments that are not used in the expression.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can identify the mismatch or oversight leading to the incorrect handling of array arguments in the function signature. This will be the key to developing a patch that ensures array arguments are correctly handled by the `CythonCodeWrapper`, regardless of their usage in the final expression."
