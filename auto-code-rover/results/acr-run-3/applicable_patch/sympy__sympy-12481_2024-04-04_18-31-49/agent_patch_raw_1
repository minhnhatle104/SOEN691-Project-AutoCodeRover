This patch addresses the issue by removing the check for duplicate elements in cycles, allowing non-disjoint cycles to be passed to the constructor. It then modifies the handling of cyclic input to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order, converting the resulting permutation into array form. This approach ensures that the constructor can handle non-disjoint cycles as expected, creating the correct permutation without raising a `ValueError`.
