        "content": "Based on the information provided from the search result, the `Permutation` class is located in the file `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. This class contains a variety of methods related to permutation operations, including constructors, properties, and operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion.\n\nThe issue at hand concerns the constructor of the `Permutation` class, specifically when it is called with non-disjoint cycles, such as `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])`. The expected behavior, as described in the issue, is for the constructor to apply the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. However, the current implementation raises a `ValueError` in this scenario.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to look more closely at the constructor method (`__new__`) and any other methods it relies on to handle the input cycles. Since the issue specifically mentions the constructor's handling of non-disjoint cycles, our focus should be on understanding how these cycles are processed and identifying where the logic needs to be adjusted to accommodate the expected behavior.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve examining the implementation of the `__new__` method and any helper methods it uses to process the input cycles. This will help us identify the exact point in the code where the `ValueError` is raised and devise a strategy to modify the behavior to align with the expectations outlined in the issue."
