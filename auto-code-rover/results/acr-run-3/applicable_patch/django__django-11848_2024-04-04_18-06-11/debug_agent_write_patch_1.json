        "content": "Based on the collected context from the `parse_http_date` method in `django/utils/http.py`, the issue revolves around the handling of two-digit years in HTTP date formats. The method attempts to parse dates according to the formats specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1, which includes support for RFC850 dates that use two-digit years.\n\nThe relevant portion of the code that deals with two-digit years is as follows:\n\n```python\nif year < 100:\n    if year < 70:\n        year += 2000\n    else:\n        year += 1900\n```\n\nThis logic hard-codes the interpretation of two-digit years: years less than 70 are considered to be in the 2000s (2000-2069), and years from 70 to 99 are considered to be in the 1900s (1970-1999). This approach does not comply with the guidance from RFC 7231 (and similarly in RFC 2822), which states that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\n\nTo address the issue, the logic for interpreting two-digit years needs to be updated to compare the two-digit year against the current year, rather than using a fixed range. This will ensure compliance with RFC 7231 and correct interpretation of two-digit years in HTTP date formats."
