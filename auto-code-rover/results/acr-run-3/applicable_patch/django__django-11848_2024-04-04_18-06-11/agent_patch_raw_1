This patch updates the logic for handling two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` method to comply with RFC 7231's guidance. It dynamically calculates the correct century for a two-digit year based on the current year, ensuring that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future is interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.
