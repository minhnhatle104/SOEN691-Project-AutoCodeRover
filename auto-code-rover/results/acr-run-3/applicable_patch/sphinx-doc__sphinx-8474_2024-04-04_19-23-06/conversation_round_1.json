Given the nature of the issue, it seems related to the processing of tables in documentation and their numbering, possibly linked to a method or class that deals with references or table numbering. \n\nLet's start by searching for methods or classes that could be directly involved with `numref` handling or table numbering. Since the issue doesn't provide specific class or method names, we'll start with a broad search related to `numref` and tables in Sphinx's codebase.\n\n1. `search_code(\"numref\")`: This will help us find code snippets that mention `numref`, which is directly related to the issue.\n2. `search_code(\"no number is assigned for table\")`: This will help us find the exact place in the code where the warning is generated, which could lead us to the logic that's causing the issue.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to understand the context of the problem and potentially identify the buggy components."

This could mean that the warning message is either dynamically generated or part of a dependency not directly searchable through the code snippets.\n\nGiven these findings, the most relevant files for further investigation seem to be `sphinx/domains/std.py` due to the highest number of matches for `numref`, and `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py` since the issue mentions the warning appears when building `latex`. The `application.py` file might also be relevant as it could contain initialization or configuration logic related to `numref`.\n\nTo proceed, we should look into how `numref` is handled within these files, especially focusing on any changes that might have been introduced in version 3.3 of Sphinx. Since the warning message itself wasn't found, it's possible that the issue arises from how tables are processed or numbered in relation to `numref` references, rather than a direct issue with the warning message generation.\n\nNext steps for a more detailed analysis could involve:\n- Reviewing the mentioned files for changes related to table numbering or `numref` handling between the previous version and 3.3.\n- Checking the Sphinx 3.3 changelog again with a focus on changes related to the mentioned files or `numref` handling in general.\n- Exploring how tables are processed in the `latex` and `singlehtml` build processes, as these are the contexts in which the warning appears.\n\nThis approach should help narrow down the source of the warning and guide towards a potential solution."
