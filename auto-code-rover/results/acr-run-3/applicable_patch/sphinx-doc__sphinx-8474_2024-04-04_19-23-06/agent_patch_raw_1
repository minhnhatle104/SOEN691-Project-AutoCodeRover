Based on the provided code snippets and the issue description, it seems the warning "no number is assigned for table" is generated when a figure, table, or any enumerable does not have a number assigned to it in the context of `numref`. This can happen if the document or section containing the table is not numbered or if numbering is disabled (`numfig` is False). The warning is a helpful indicator, but it might be too verbose or not actionable in some cases, especially if numbering is intentionally disabled.

To address the issue, we could enhance the warning message to provide more context about why a number is not assigned, making it clearer to the user how to resolve the warning. Additionally, we could add a configuration option to suppress these specific warnings if the user is aware and accepting of unnumbered tables or figures.

Here's a proposed patch to improve the warning message and introduce a configuration option to suppress these warnings:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/domains/std.py</file>
<original>logger.warning(__("no number is assigned for %s: %s"), figtype, labelid,
                           location=node)</original>
<patched>logger.warning(__("no number is assigned for %s: %s. This can occur if numbering is disabled or if the figure/table is in an unnumbered section."), figtype, labelid,
                           location=node)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/config.py</file>
<original># Add near other configuration options
</original>
<patched># Add near other configuration options
suppress_numref_warnings = False
# Explanation comment for the new option
# suppress_numref_warnings: Suppress warnings when no number is assigned for figures or tables referenced with :numref:. Useful when numbering is intentionally disabled.</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>sphinx/domains/std.py</file>
<original>logger.warning(__("no number is assigned for %s: %s"), figtype, labelid,
                           location=node)</original>
<patched>if not env.config.suppress_numref_warnings:
    logger.warning(__("no number is assigned for %s: %s. This can occur if numbering is disabled or if the figure/table is in an unnumbered section."), figtype, labelid,
                               location=node)</patched>
```

These modifications aim to make the warning more informative and give users the option to suppress it if they are already aware of the situation causing it. This approach maintains the utility of the warning for users who might be unintentionally encountering this issue while providing flexibility for those who have a different use case.
