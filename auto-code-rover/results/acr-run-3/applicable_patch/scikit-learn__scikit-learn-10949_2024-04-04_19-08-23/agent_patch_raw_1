Explanation:
The patch addresses the issue where `warn_on_dtype` does not trigger a warning when a pandas DataFrame's dtype is converted. The original code only checked if the overall dtype of the input array changed after conversion. However, this approach does not work well with pandas DataFrames, where each column can have its own dtype. The patched code first checks if the original input (`array_orig`) is a pandas DataFrame by checking for the `dtypes` attribute. If it is a DataFrame, it then checks if all column dtypes in the original DataFrame match the converted array's dtype. If there's a mismatch, it triggers a `DataConversionWarning` with a message that includes the original dtypes and the converted dtype. For inputs that are not pandas DataFrames, the original behavior is preserved. This ensures that the warning mechanism works as expected for both pandas DataFrames and other array-like inputs.
