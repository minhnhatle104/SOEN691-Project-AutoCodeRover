Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"check_array\")`: This will help me understand where the `check_array` method is defined in the codebase and its implementation details, which is crucial for addressing the issue related to the `warn_on_dtype` parameter not functioning as expected.\n\n2. `search_code(\"warn_on_dtype\")`: Since the issue is specifically about the `warn_on_dtype` parameter having no effect, searching for this parameter in the codebase could provide insights into where and how it's supposed to be used, and why it might not be working with pandas `DataFrame` objects."
