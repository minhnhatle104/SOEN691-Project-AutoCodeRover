        "content": "Based on the information collected from the `mutual_info_score` method in the `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` file, we can deduce several key points relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Functionality of `mutual_info_score`:** This function calculates the Mutual Information between two clusterings, which is a measure of similarity between two labels of the same data. It is independent of the absolute values of the labels, meaning a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the score value.\n\n2. **Parameters:** The method accepts `labels_true` and `labels_pred` as input parameters, which are expected to be integer arrays of shape `[n_samples]`. There's also an optional `contingency` parameter that can be provided directly to avoid recomputation.\n\n3. **Contingency Matrix Handling:** If the `contingency` parameter is not provided, it is computed using the `contingency_matrix` function based on `labels_true` and `labels_pred`. The contingency matrix can be either a dense numpy array or a sparse matrix.\n\n4. **Data Type Handling:** The method performs checks and conversions on the input data. For instance, if the contingency matrix is provided, it is checked with `check_array` to ensure it's of an acceptable sparse format and data type (`int`, `np.int32`, `np.int64`).\n\n5. **Computation Logic:** The method computes mutual information using the contingency matrix, involving operations like non-zero value extraction, summing, and logarithmic calculations. It supports both dense and sparse representations of the contingency matrix.\n\n6. **Issue Context:** The reported issue mentions a regression in input validation, where passing an array of objects (after using `.astype(object)`) to `mutual_info_score` results in a `ValueError` due to inability to convert string to float, whereas previously (in version 0.21.1) it worked without a warning.\n\nGiven these insights, the problem seems to revolve around how input data types are handled and validated within the `mutual_info_score` function or possibly in the functions it relies on, such as `check_clusterings` or `contingency_matrix`. The regression might be due to changes in these validation or conversion processes that now reject or mishandle object-type arrays, which were previously accepted.\n\nTo further investigate and address the issue, we might need to:\n- Examine changes made to the `mutual_info_score` function or its dependencies (`check_clusterings`, `contingency_matrix`, `check_array`) since version 0.21.1.\n- Understand how object-type arrays were handled previously and identify the change that led to the current behavior.\n- Propose a patch that restores the previous behavior without reintroducing any potential issues that the changes might have aimed to fix."
