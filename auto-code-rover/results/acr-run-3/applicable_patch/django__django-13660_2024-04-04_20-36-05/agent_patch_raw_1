```

**Explanation**: The patch modifies the `exec` call within the `handle` method of the `Command` class in `django/core/management/commands/shell.py`. It adds a second argument to `exec`, which is a dictionary providing a minimal set of globals needed for the execution of the command. This dictionary includes `__builtins__` to ensure that built-in functions are available, and it explicitly adds the `django` module to the execution context. This should resolve the issue where the `django` module was not recognized within the executed code.

**Note**: This patch assumes that the `django` module is already imported in the scope of this file. If it's not, you would need to add an import statement at the top of the file: `import django`.
