The constructor (`__new__` method) of `Point2D` can accept arguments for the coordinates of the point. The error message \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted\" originates from this class, indicating that the issue likely arises when trying to instantiate a `Point2D` object with certain arguments under the `evaluate(False)` context.\n\n2. **evaluate Context Manager**: The `evaluate` function from `sympy/core/parameters.py` is a context manager that controls whether SymPy functions evaluate by default. When used with `evaluate(False)`, it prevents automatic evaluation of expressions. This feature is experimental and may not work as intended for all expressions. The issue occurs within this context, suggesting that the instantiation of `Point2D` with `evaluate(False)` somehow leads to an unexpected evaluation or lack thereof, causing the error.\n\n3. **sympify Function**: Although the specific search for the `sympify` function in the file `sympy/core/sympify.py` did not yield results due to the file not being found in the codebase, the error trace involves this function. `sympify` is crucial for converting Python objects into SymPy objects, respecting the `evaluate` parameter. The issue might be related to how `sympify` handles the `evaluate` parameter when converting the input to a `Point2D` object.\n\n4. **Usage of `with evaluate(False):`**: The search for code snippets containing `with evaluate(False):` found several matches across different test files and the `parameters.py` file itself. These examples could provide insight into the intended use of the `evaluate(False)` context and any nuances in its behavior.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around how the `Point2D` constructor interacts with the `evaluate(False)` context, potentially related to how arguments are evaluated or not evaluated in this context. The next step in resolving the issue would involve examining the implementation details of `Point2D.__new__`, how `sympify` processes arguments with `evaluate=False`, and how these components are supposed to work within the `evaluate(False)` context. A patch would likely involve ensuring that `Point2D` instantiation respects the `evaluate` context appropriately, possibly by adjusting how arguments are processed or evaluated in this specific case."

This suggests that the `Point2D` constructor delegates some of its initialization logic to the `Point` class, specifically for argument checking and instantiation.\n   - The error \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted\" likely originates from deeper within the `Point` class or its parent classes, where the actual check for imaginary coordinates is performed.\n   - The issue does not seem to be directly within the `Point2D.__new__` method itself but rather in how the arguments are processed and passed down to the `Point` class, especially under the influence of the `evaluate(False)` context.\n\n2. **global_parameters.evaluate in evaluate Context Manager**:\n   - The `evaluate` context manager in `sympy/core/parameters.py` modifies the `global_parameters.evaluate` state to control automatic evaluation. The context manager ensures that the original state is restored after its block is executed.\n   - The issue might be related to how this global evaluation state affects the processing and evaluation of arguments passed to `Point2D` and, by extension, to `Point`.\n\n3. **sympify Method**:\n   - The search for the `sympify` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` did not yield results, suggesting that the relevant implementation details might be located elsewhere or that the initial assumption about the file location was incorrect. However, the `sympify` function is crucial for understanding the issue since it's involved in converting Python objects into SymPy objects, respecting the `evaluate` parameter.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\n- The bug seems to be related to how the `evaluate(False)` context affects the instantiation of `Point2D` objects. Specifically, the interaction between the global evaluation state controlled by `evaluate` and the argument processing in `Point2D` (and `Point`) might not be handling the evaluation state as expected.\n- The direct cause of the \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted\" error is likely not in the `Point2D.__new__` method itself but rather in how arguments are evaluated and passed to the `Point` class under the `evaluate(False)` context.\n- Further investigation into how `Point` processes arguments and how the `sympify` function operates under different evaluation states would be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause and develop a patch. Unfortunately, the search for `sympify` in `sympy/core/basic.py` did not provide the needed insights, indicating that a more thorough review of the codebase or additional searches might be required to locate the relevant implementation details."
