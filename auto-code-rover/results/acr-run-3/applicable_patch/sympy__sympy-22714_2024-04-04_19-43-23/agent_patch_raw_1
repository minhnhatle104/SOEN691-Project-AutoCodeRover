    # Ensure evaluate=False is respected when creating Point instances
    with evaluate(False):
        args = Point(*args, **kwargs)
return GeometryEntity.__new__(cls, *args)</patched>
```

Explanation:
The modification ensures that when a `Point2D` instance is created with `_nocheck=False`, the instantiation of the `Point` superclass respects the `evaluate=False` context if it is active. This is achieved by wrapping the `Point` instantiation in a `with evaluate(False):` block, ensuring that the global evaluation state is correctly applied during this process. This change addresses the issue where creating a `Point2D` instance within an `evaluate(False)` context could lead to unexpected evaluation of arguments, by explicitly enforcing the evaluation context during the creation of `Point` instances.
