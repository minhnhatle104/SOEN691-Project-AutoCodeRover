            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `Point2D` class and the `evaluate` context manager are implemented and interact with each other in the SymPy codebase. Specifically, we need to look into the implementation of the `Point2D` class, how the `evaluate` context manager affects the evaluation of expressions, and the `sympify` function since the error trace involves these components. Here are the API calls I would make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Point2D\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of the `Point2D` class, especially the constructor (`__new__` method) where the error occurs.\n2. `search_method(\"evaluate\")`: Since `evaluate` is likely not a method of a specific class but rather a context manager or a function that affects the global state, this search will help us understand how it is implemented and how it affects the evaluation of expressions.\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"sympify\", \"/home/avinash/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sympy/core/sympify.py\")`: This will give us insight into the `sympify` function, which is directly involved in the error, to see how it handles the `evaluate` parameter and how it interacts with the parsing and evaluation of expressions.\n4. `search_code(\"with evaluate(False):\")`: This search will help us find examples or other uses of the `evaluate(False)` context manager in the codebase, which might give us clues on its intended use and any related issues or patterns.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue and how they are supposed to work together."
