This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n</issue>"

It can handle both cases where the degrees are specified as integers or as lists for each variable.\n\n2. **Handling of `max_degrees` and `min_degrees`**: The function checks if these parameters are sequences (lists) and validates their lengths against the number of variables. It also checks for negative values in `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.\n\n3. **Generation of Monomials**:\n   - When `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are integers (total degree mode), the function generates combinations of variables up to `max_degree` and filters them based on `min_degree`. It differentiates between commutative and non-commutative variables.\n   - When `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are lists (individual degree mode), it generates monomials by creating power lists for each variable within the specified min and max degrees and then produces the Cartesian product of these lists.\n\n4. **Potential Issue**: The reported issue suggests that when using the total degree mode (both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are integers), the function fails to include all valid monomials that meet the criteria of having a total degree equal to the specified `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` when they are equal. Specifically, it seems to miss monomials that are combinations of different variables with total degrees equal to 3.\n\n5. **Inspection Point**: The logic that filters generated combinations based on `min_degree` in the total degree mode (integer case) needs closer inspection. The condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` seems to only consider monomials where at least one variable has a degree >= `min_degree`, which is not the correct criterion for filtering monomials based on their total degree.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to adjust the filtering logic in the total degree mode to ensure that it correctly includes all monomials whose total degree equals the specified `min_degree` (when `min_degree` equals `max_degree`). This involves correcting the logic that checks if a generated combination of variables meets the minimum degree requirement by considering the total degree of the combination rather than the maximum degree of any single variable in it."
