**Explanation**: The patch introduces a conditional check to determine if a detected order conflict is actually due to a dependency relationship between the media files involved. This requires the implementation of a function `is_dependency_of(path, other_path)` that can determine if one media file is a dependency of another. This function's implementation would depend on additional context about how dependencies are defined or inferred within the project. The idea is to reduce false positives in `MediaOrderConflictWarning` by acknowledging legitimate dependency-based ordering.
