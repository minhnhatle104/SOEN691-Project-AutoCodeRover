Additionally, understanding the `prepare_value` method of `JSONField` could provide insights into the proposed solution. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `display_for_field` method within the Django admin utils to understand how it currently handles different field types, including `JSONField`.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"display_for_field\", \"django/contrib/admin/utils.py\")`\n\n2. Search for the `JSONField` class to understand its structure and methods, especially focusing on the `prepare_value` method mentioned in the issue.\n   - `search_class(\"JSONField\")`\n\n3. Since the issue suggests modifying how `JSONField` is handled by `display_for_field`, it might be useful to see if there's an existing `prepare_value` method within the `JSONField` class that could be utilized or needs to be modified.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"prepare_value\", \"JSONField\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of the current implementation and how it might be adjusted to address the issue."
