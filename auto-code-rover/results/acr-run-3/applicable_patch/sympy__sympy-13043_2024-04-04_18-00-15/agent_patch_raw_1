```

This patch modifies the `decompose` function in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` to return a sorted list of monomials when `separate=True`. The sorting is based on two criteria:
1. The total degree of the monomial, which is calculated using the `sum(degree_list(x, *x.atoms(Symbol)))`. This ensures that monomials are primarily ordered by their total degree.
2. The lexicographical order of the string representation of the monomials (`str(x)`), which serves as a secondary sorting criterion to ensure a consistent order among monomials of the same degree.

This approach addresses the issue of arbitrary order in the returned list of monomials, ensuring a deterministic and predictable order that is consistent across different runs and environments.
