To address the issue of `socket.error` exceptions not being caught and wrapped in a `requests`-specific exception like `ConnectionError` in the `iter_content` and `content` methods of the `Response` class, we can introduce exception handling for `socket.error`. This will ensure that such exceptions are consistently wrapped into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, providing a more intuitive error handling experience for users of the library.

Here's how the patch could look:

# modification 1
```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>            try:
                # Special case for urllib3.
                try:
                    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
                        yield chunk
                except IncompleteRead as e:
                    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)
                except DecodeError as e:
                    raise ContentDecodingError(e)
            except AttributeError:
                # Standard file-like object.
                while True:
                    chunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)
                    if not chunk:
                        break
                    yield chunk</original>
<patched>            try:
                # Special case for urllib3.
                try:
                    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
                        yield chunk
                except IncompleteRead as e:
                    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)
                except DecodeError as e:
                    raise ContentDecodingError(e)
                except socket.error as e:  # Added handling for socket.error
                    raise requests.exceptions.ConnectionError(e)
            except AttributeError:
                # Standard file-like object.
                while True:
                    chunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)
                    if not chunk:
                        break
                    yield chunk</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>            try:
                if self._content_consumed:
                    raise RuntimeError(
                        'The content for this response was already consumed')

                if self.status_code == 0:
                    self._content = None
                else:
                    self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()

            except AttributeError:
                self._content = None</original>
<patched>            try:
                if self._content_consumed:
                    raise RuntimeError(
                        'The content for this response was already consumed')

                if self.status_code == 0:
                    self._content = None
                else:
                    try:
                        self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()
                    except socket.error as e:  # Added handling for socket.error
                        raise requests.exceptions.ConnectionError(e)

            except AttributeError:
                self._content = None</patched>
```

In these modifications, we've added a `try-except` block to catch `socket.error` exceptions and re-raise them as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This ensures that users of the `requests` library will encounter a consistent and understandable set of exceptions, even in cases where lower-level socket errors occur. Note that for this patch to work, you need to ensure that the `socket` module and `requests.exceptions` are appropriately imported in the `requests/models.py` file.
