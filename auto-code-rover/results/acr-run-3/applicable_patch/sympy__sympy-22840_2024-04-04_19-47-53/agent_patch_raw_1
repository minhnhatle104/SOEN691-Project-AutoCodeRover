Given the context and the nature of the issue with `MatrixSymbol` indexing in the `cse` function, a precise patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the internal workings and the specific requirements of the SymPy library. However, I can propose a conceptual patch based on the common patterns of issues related to symbolic computation and matrix operations in SymPy.

The issue seems to stem from the handling of `MatrixSymbol` objects during the common subexpression elimination process. A potential cause could be that `MatrixSymbol` objects are not being correctly identified or processed as matrix entities during the substitution phase, leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior.

A conceptual patch could involve ensuring that `MatrixSymbol` objects and their indexed elements are correctly identified and handled during the CSE process, particularly in the substitution phase within the `cse` function.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/cse_main.py</file>
<original>
for e in exprs:
    if isinstance(e, (Matrix, ImmutableMatrix)):
        temp.append(Tuple(*e.flat()))
    elif isinstance(e, (SparseMatrix, ImmutableSparseMatrix)):
        temp.append(Tuple(*e.todok().items()))
    else:
        temp.append(e)
</original>
<patched>
for e in exprs:
    if isinstance(e, (Matrix, ImmutableMatrix, MatrixSymbol)):
        temp.append(Tuple(*e.flat()))
    elif isinstance(e, (SparseMatrix, ImmutableSparseMatrix)):
        temp.append(Tuple(*e.todok().items()))
    else:
        temp.append(e)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/core/basic.py</file>
<original>
for old, new in sequence:
    rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
    if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
        break
</original>
<patched>
for old, new in sequence:
    if isinstance(old, MatrixSymbol) and isinstance(new, Matrix):
        # Special handling for MatrixSymbol substitution to Matrix
        rv = special_matrix_symbol_subs(rv, old, new, **kwargs)
    else:
        rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
    if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
        break

def special_matrix_symbol_subs(expr, old_sym, new_matrix, **kwargs):
    # This function should implement the specific logic needed to substitute
    # a MatrixSymbol with a Matrix object correctly, respecting indexing and
    # other relevant aspects.
    # Placeholder for actual implementation.
    return expr
</patched>
```

These modifications are conceptual and aim to highlight areas in the code that might require adjustments to handle `MatrixSymbol` objects correctly during the CSE process. The actual implementation of `special_matrix_symbol_subs` would need to be developed based on a thorough understanding of the desired behavior and the SymPy library's internals.
