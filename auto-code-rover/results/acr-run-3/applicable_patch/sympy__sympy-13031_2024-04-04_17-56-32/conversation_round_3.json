Since direct searches for the `Matrix` class and the specific methods did not yield results, we might consider the following alternative strategies:\n\n1. **Search for the methods in the entire codebase**: This approach broadens the search beyond a specific class, which could help locate the methods if they are not directly under the `Matrix` class or if they are dynamically added to the class in a way that the search API does not recognize.\n\n2. **Search for code snippets**: Since we have specific code snippets from the issue description, searching for these snippets in the codebase might lead us to the relevant parts of the code where `hstack` and `vstack` are implemented or used. This could provide clues about where to look further.\n\n3. **Manual inspection**: If automated search methods continue to fail, manually inspecting the codebase, especially the parts related to matrix operations, could be necessary. This might involve looking at the documentation or source code of the `sympy` library around versions 1.0 and 1.1 to understand changes made to matrix stacking behavior.\n\nGiven the limitations of our current approach, let's attempt the first alternative strategy:\n\n- search_method(\"hstack\")\n- search_method(\"vstack\")\n\nThese searches aim to find any occurrence of `hstack` and `vstack` methods in the codebase, which could lead us to the correct implementation or usage context."

This adjustment is based on the assumption that the methods exist but might not be directly tied to a class named \"Matrix\" in a manner that the search API can directly correlate.\n\nTherefore, let's attempt the following search API calls with corrected arguments:\n\n- search_method(\"hstack\")\n- search_method(\"vstack\")\n\nThese calls are designed to locate any implementation or reference to the `hstack` and `vstack` methods within the entire codebase, without assuming they are part of a specific class.

Both methods are found in the `sympy/matrices/common.py` file, within the `MatrixShaping` class. This gives us a clear starting point for understanding the issue and formulating a solution.\n\n### Analysis of `hstack` and `vstack` Implementations\n\nBoth methods follow a similar structure:\n- They check if the `args` list is empty, and if so, return a new matrix instance via `cls._new()`.\n- They determine the class (`kls`) of the first argument to use its `row_join` or `col_join` method for horizontal or vertical stacking, respectively.\n- They use the `reduce` function to iteratively apply `row_join` or `col_join` to the arguments, effectively stacking them.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\nThe issue described involves unexpected behavior when using `hstack` with matrices of zero rows. In sympy 1.0, stacking matrices with zero rows horizontally would result in a matrix whose column count is the sum of the columns of the matrices being stacked. However, in sympy 1.1, the behavior changed, and the resulting matrix does not reflect the expected column count when all matrices have zero rows.\n\nGiven the implementations of `hstack` and `vstack`, a few potential areas could be contributing to this issue:\n1. **Handling of Zero-Dimension Matrices**: The method might not be accounting correctly for matrices with zero rows or columns, especially in how the `row_join` or `col_join` methods are applied.\n2. **Type and Consistency of Arguments**: The determination of the class (`kls`) from the first argument and its use in `reduce` suggests that inconsistencies in the argument types or their dimensions might lead to unexpected results.\n3. **Behavior of `row_join` and `col_join`**: Since `hstack` and `vstack` rely on these methods, any changes or bugs in `row_join` or `col_join` could directly affect stacking behavior.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo address the issue, we should:\n1. Review the implementation of `row_join` and `col_join` methods to ensure they handle zero-dimension matrices as expected.\n2. Verify how `hstack` and `vstack` manage lists of matrices, especially when dimensions are zero, to identify any changes between sympy 1.0 and 1.1 that might have introduced the issue.\n3. Consider edge cases in the tests, such as all matrices having zero rows or columns, to ensure the expected behavior is maintained across versions.\n\nGiven the information collected, we have a clear direction for investigating and resolving the issue. The next step would involve diving deeper into the `row_join` and `col_join` methods and testing scenarios with zero-dimension matrices to pinpoint the exact cause of the behavior change."
