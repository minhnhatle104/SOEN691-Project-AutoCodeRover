The issue description indicates a change in behavior between `sympy` versions 1.0 and 1.1 when stacking matrices of zero rows. To gather the necessary information, we will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `Matrix` class to understand its structure and methods related to the issue.\n2. Search for the `hstack` method within the `Matrix` class to see how horizontal stacking is implemented.\n3. Search for the `vstack` method within the `Matrix` class to see how vertical stacking is implemented, even though the issue specifically mentions `hstack`, it's useful to understand both for a comprehensive view.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_class(\"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"hstack\", \"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"vstack\", \"Matrix\")"
