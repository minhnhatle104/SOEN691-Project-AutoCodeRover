The issue description indicates a change in behavior between `sympy` versions 1.0 and 1.1 when stacking matrices of zero rows. To gather the necessary information, we will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `Matrix` class to understand its structure and methods related to the issue.\n2. Search for the `hstack` method within the `Matrix` class to see how horizontal stacking is implemented.\n3. Search for the `vstack` method within the `Matrix` class to see how vertical stacking is implemented, even though the issue specifically mentions `hstack`, it's useful to understand both for a comprehensive view.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_class(\"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"hstack\", \"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"vstack\", \"Matrix\")"

This could be due to several reasons, such as the class or methods being dynamically generated, existing under a different module or namespace than expected, or possibly a discrepancy in the search API's ability to locate them.\n\nGiven this situation, we need to adjust our approach to gather the necessary context for addressing the issue. Since direct searches for the `Matrix` class and the specific methods did not yield results, we might consider the following alternative strategies:\n\n1. **Search for the methods in the entire codebase**: This approach broadens the search beyond a specific class, which could help locate the methods if they are not directly under the `Matrix` class or if they are dynamically added to the class in a way that the search API does not recognize.\n\n2. **Search for code snippets**: Since we have specific code snippets from the issue description, searching for these snippets in the codebase might lead us to the relevant parts of the code where `hstack` and `vstack` are implemented or used. This could provide clues about where to look further.\n\n3. **Manual inspection**: If automated search methods continue to fail, manually inspecting the codebase, especially the parts related to matrix operations, could be necessary. This might involve looking at the documentation or source code of the `sympy` library around versions 1.0 and 1.1 to understand changes made to matrix stacking behavior.\n\nGiven the limitations of our current approach, let's attempt the first alternative strategy:\n\n- search_method(\"hstack\")\n- search_method(\"vstack\")\n\nThese searches aim to find any occurrence of `hstack` and `vstack` methods in the codebase, which could lead us to the correct implementation or usage context."
