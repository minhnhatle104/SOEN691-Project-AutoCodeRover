# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py</file>
<original>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</original>
<patched>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field[:] = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the result of the `replace` operation is assigned back to `output_field`. Since `output_field` is likely an array-like object where `replace` does not modify the object in place, using `output_field[:] =` ensures that the modified data is written back into the original object. This approach maintains the original intent of the code while correcting the behavior to reflect the non-in-place nature of the `replace` method.
