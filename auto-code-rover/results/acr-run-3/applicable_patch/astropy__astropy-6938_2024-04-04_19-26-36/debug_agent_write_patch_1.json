        "content": "Based on the search results, we have the following context to analyze the issue:\n\n1. **Presence of the Code Snippet**: The code snippet in question is indeed found in `fitsrec.py` within the `_scale_back_ascii` function of the `FITS_rec` class. This confirms that the issue is located in a specific part of the code that deals with scaling back ASCII values, particularly replacing 'E' with 'D' in floating point number representations when the format contains 'D'.\n\n2. **Usage of `replace` Method**: The search for the `replace` method within `fitsrec.py` did not find any method definition for `replace`, which implies that the `replace` operation being used is likely a method of a Python standard or external library type, not a custom method defined within `fitsrec.py`. This aligns with the issue's description that `replace` is not an in-place operation, suggesting that the method belongs to a string or array-like object.\n\n3. **`chararray` Class**: The search did not find a `chararray` class within the codebase. This could mean that `chararray` is part of an external library (e.g., NumPy) or that the issue's description might have referred to a concept or type from an external dependency rather than a specific class defined within the project. Given that `replace` is mentioned in the context of not being in-place, it's plausible that the operation is being performed on an object that behaves like a character array but does not modify the original object.\n\nGiven this context, the core of the issue seems to be a misunderstanding or misuse of the `replace` method. The expectation that `replace` would modify `output_field` in place is not met, likely because `output_field` is of a type (possibly a string or a NumPy array-like object) where `replace` returns a modified copy rather than altering the original object. This behavior is typical of strings in Python, where most methods that manipulate the string return new string objects instead of modifying the original string in place.\n\nTo address the issue, the code needs to be modified to ensure that the result of the `replace` operation is used, either by assigning it back to `output_field` or by another means that achieves the intended effect. Further analysis and testing would be required to determine the best approach, considering the function's role and how `output_field` is used subsequently in the code."
