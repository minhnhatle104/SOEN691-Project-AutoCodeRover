Given the complexity of the `simplify` function and the specific issue at hand, a direct patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the internal workings and dependencies of the SymPy library. However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to address the issue based on the analysis.

The issue arises from the simplification process resulting in an inequivalent expression, specifically when simplifying expressions involving symbolic powers and fractions. The problem might be related to the heuristic measures used to determine the "simplicity" of expressions or the specific strategies applied during the simplification process.

A potential approach to address this issue could involve adding a check or modification to ensure that simplifications involving symbolic powers maintain equivalence. This could be implemented as an additional step or condition within the simplification process.

# Conceptual Patch

```python
<file>sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original>
if expr.has(Sum):
    expr = sum_simplify(expr)

if expr.has(Product):
    expr = product_simplify(expr)
</original>
<patched>
# Before applying general simplification strategies, check for expressions
# involving symbolic powers and apply a targeted simplification strategy
# that ensures equivalence.
if expr.has(Pow) and any(arg.has(Symbol) for arg in expr.args):
    expr = targeted_simplify_for_symbolic_powers(expr)

if expr.has(Sum):
    expr = sum_simplify(expr)

if expr.has(Product):
    expr = product_simplify(expr)

def targeted_simplify_for_symbolic_powers(expr):
    """
    Implement a simplification strategy for expressions involving symbolic powers
    that ensures the simplified expression is equivalent to the original.
    This function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented based on the
    specific requirements and behaviors observed.
    """
    # Placeholder implementation
    # Analyze the expression and apply simplifications that maintain equivalence
    return expr
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch suggests introducing a new function `targeted_simplify_for_symbolic_powers` that specifically addresses the issue with symbolic powers. The actual implementation of this function would require a detailed understanding of the types of simplifications that lead to inequivalent expressions and devising strategies that avoid or correct these issues.

Please note, this is a conceptual approach and not a direct patch. Implementing this solution would require in-depth testing to ensure it does not introduce new issues or adversely affect the performance of the `simplify` function.
