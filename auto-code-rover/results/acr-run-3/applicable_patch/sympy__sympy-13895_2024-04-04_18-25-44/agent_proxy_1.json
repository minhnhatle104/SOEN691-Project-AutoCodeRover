However, to fully understand the problem and devise a solution, it might be beneficial to look into the implementation details of the `simplify` method, especially how it handles expressions similar to the one in the issue. Therefore, one more context that could be useful is the implementation details of the `simplify` method in the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file. \n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")`: This will help us understand the specific logic within the `simplify` method that might be causing the issue.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\nBased on the analysis, the bug is likely located in:\n- **Buggy File**: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `simplify`\n\nAdditionally, the test case related to this issue is located in:\n- **Related Test File**: `sympy/core/tests/test_numbers.py`\n- **Related Test Function**: `test_issue_13890`\n\nThis information points us towards the `simplify` method as the primary location to investigate for the bug, as it is directly involved in the issue described. The test case provides a context for validating any fixes made to address the issue."
