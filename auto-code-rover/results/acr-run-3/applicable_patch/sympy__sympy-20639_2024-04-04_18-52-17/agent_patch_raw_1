This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the nth root notation is only used when the base `b` is not negative. This is a speculative fix based on the understanding that the incorrect rendering might be related to the handling of nth roots. Since the original issue description points to a problem with rendering `pi**(1/E)`, which involves a root notation, this patch adds an additional check to ensure that the root notation is not applied inappropriately. This fix assumes that the incorrect rendering might be due to the handling of negative bases or complex numbers in the root notation, which is not directly evident from the provided context but is a common source of issues in mathematical rendering.
