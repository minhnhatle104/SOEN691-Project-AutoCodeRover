This is not a problem in v5.2.\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n### Expected behavior\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.

The mixin provides a method named `_arithmetic` that seems to be the core function where arithmetic operations, including multiplication, are managed. This method, along with other helper methods like `_arithmetic_mask`, plays a crucial role in handling the operands and their associated masks during arithmetic operations.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem arises when performing operations where one operand does not have a mask, leading to a `TypeError` due to an attempt to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and `None`. The method `_arithmetic_mask` is particularly interesting in this context, as it is likely where mask handling logic is implemented, including the use of `handle_mask` which defaults to `np.logical_or` but can be overridden, as in the issue's example, to `np.bitwise_or`.\n\nThe presence of the `operation_ignores_mask` parameter in the `_arithmetic` method also hints at the flexibility in how masks are considered during operations, which could be relevant to solving the issue.\n\nTo further pinpoint the bug and understand how the mask is incorrectly handled when one operand lacks a mask, we should focus on the `_arithmetic_mask` method. This method is where the logic for combining or propagating masks between operands is likely implemented, and understanding its implementation will be key to identifying the exact cause of the issue and devising a fix.\n\nTherefore, the bug location can be identified as follows:\n\n- **where are bug locations:** \n  - **buggy files:** `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`\n  - **buggy methods:** `_arithmetic_mask`\n\nTo proceed with the analysis and get a clearer picture of how the mask is handled, especially when one operand does not have a mask, we should examine the implementation of the `_arithmetic_mask` method:\n\n- **do we need more context:** \n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"_arithmetic_mask\", \"NDArithmeticMixin\")\n```"

The method's documentation and code reveal the intended logic for combining masks from two operands:\n\n1. **If only one mask is present:** The existing mask is simply copied and returned. This is handled by checking if either `self.mask` or `operand.mask` is `None`, and if so, returning a deep copy of the mask that is not `None`.\n2. **If neither operand has a mask:** `None` is returned.\n3. **If both operands have masks:** The `handle_mask` function is called to combine the two masks. By default, or in the case specified by the issue, this could be a bitwise operation such as `np.bitwise_or`.\n\nThe issue reported occurs when attempting to perform a bitwise OR operation (`np.bitwise_or`) between an integer mask and a `None` value, leading to a `TypeError`. However, based on the implementation provided, there seems to be a safeguard against this exact scenario by returning `None` if either operand does not have a mask, or by copying the existing mask if only one operand has it. This suggests that the issue might not be within the logic of `_arithmetic_mask` itself but could be related to how operands without masks are handled or passed to this method.\n\nGiven the implementation details, the bug might not be in the logic for handling the presence or absence of masks directly but could involve:\n- How `handle_mask` is applied or how operands are prepared before calling `_arithmetic_mask`.\n- A misunderstanding or misconfiguration of how `handle_mask` should be used, especially with respect to the default behavior or the specific use case of `np.bitwise_or`.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, we would need to:\n- Review how operands are prepared and passed to `_arithmetic_mask`, particularly focusing on the use of `handle_mask`.\n- Investigate any changes between versions 5.2 and 5.3 that might affect the handling of masks or the application of `handle_mask`.\n\nHowever, based on the current context and the specific details of the `_arithmetic_mask` method, we can pinpoint the location related to the bug as follows:\n\n- **where are bug locations:** \n  - **buggy files:** `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`\n  - **buggy methods:** `_arithmetic_mask`\n\nThe analysis suggests that the issue might stem from how `handle_mask` is utilized or from a broader context of operand preparation and handling, rather than a direct flaw within the `_arithmetic_mask` method's logic."

The current implementation correctly handles cases where one or both operands do not have a mask, but the issue seems to stem from how the `handle_mask` function is applied when one operand is missing a mask.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to ensure that when `handle_mask` is a function that cannot handle `None` values (like `np.bitwise_or`), the code gracefully handles the scenario where one of the operands does not have a mask. We can introduce a check to ensure that if one of the masks is `None`, the `handle_mask` function is not called with `None` as one of its arguments, thus avoiding the `TypeError`.\n\nHere is a proposed patch:\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py</file>\n<original>        else:\n            # Now lets calculate the resulting mask (operation enforces copy)\n            return handle_mask(self.mask, operand.mask, **kwds)\n</original>\n<patched>        else:\n            # Check if either mask is None and handle_mask cannot handle None values\n            if self.mask is None or operand.mask is None:\n                # Fallback to logical_or if one of the masks is None to avoid TypeError\n                return np.logical_or(self.mask, operand.mask) if self.mask is not None or operand.mask is not None else None\n            else:\n                # Now lets calculate the resulting mask (operation enforces copy)\n                return handle_mask(self.mask, operand.mask, **kwds)\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis patch introduces a fallback mechanism to use `np.logical_or` when one of the masks is `None`, which is a safe operation since `np.logical_or` can handle `None` values by treating them as `False`. This ensures that arithmetic operations that specify a `handle_mask` function like `np.bitwise_or`, which cannot handle `None` values, do not result in a `TypeError` when one operand lacks a mask. This approach maintains the intended behavior of propagating masks when both operands have them, while also gracefully handling cases where one operand does not have a mask."
