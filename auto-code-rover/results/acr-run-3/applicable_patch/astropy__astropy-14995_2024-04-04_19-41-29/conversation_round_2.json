This is not a problem in v5.2.\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n### Expected behavior\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n### How to Reproduce\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\n```\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\n[ 8,  0,  1],\n[ 2,  1,  0]])\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\n```\n### Versions\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\nastropy 5.3\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\nNumpy 1.24.3\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\nScipy 1.10.1\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\n</issue>"

However, the search for the `multiply` method directly within the `NDDataRef` class did not yield any results. This suggests that the `multiply` method might not be explicitly defined within the `NDDataRef` class itself but could be inherited or handled through one of its mixins, as indicated by the class definition including `NDArithmeticMixin` among others.\n\nGiven this information, the issue with mask propagation during arithmetic operations, specifically with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, likely involves the way the `NDArithmeticMixin` handles masks, especially when one of the operands does not have a mask. The error described in the issue (`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'`) indicates a problem with attempting to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and a `None` value, which is not allowed in Python.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, we should look into the `NDArithmeticMixin` to understand how it implements arithmetic operations and handles mask propagation. Specifically, we need to find out how it deals with cases where one operand lacks a mask, and how it was supposed to handle such cases in version 5.2, where the issue was not present.\n\nTherefore, the next steps in our investigation should include:\n\n1. Searching for the `NDArithmeticMixin` to understand its role in arithmetic operations involving `NDDataRef` instances.\n2. Looking for any methods or code snippets within `NDArithmeticMixin` that deal with mask handling, especially those that might involve the `handle_mask` parameter and bitwise operations.\n\nLet's proceed with searching for the `NDArithmeticMixin` and any relevant mask handling logic within it:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"NDArithmeticMixin\")\n```"

        "content": "With the information obtained from the search result for `NDArithmeticMixin`, we can now understand how arithmetic operations are handled for `NDDataRef` objects, which inherit behavior from this mixin. The mixin provides a method named `_arithmetic` that seems to be the core function where arithmetic operations, including multiplication, are managed. This method, along with other helper methods like `_arithmetic_mask`, plays a crucial role in handling the operands and their associated masks during arithmetic operations.\n\nGiven the issue description, the problem arises when performing operations where one operand does not have a mask, leading to a `TypeError` due to an attempt to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and `None`. The method `_arithmetic_mask` is particularly interesting in this context, as it is likely where mask handling logic is implemented, including the use of `handle_mask` which defaults to `np.logical_or` but can be overridden, as in the issue's example, to `np.bitwise_or`.\n\nThe presence of the `operation_ignores_mask` parameter in the `_arithmetic` method also hints at the flexibility in how masks are considered during operations, which could be relevant to solving the issue.\n\nTo further pinpoint the bug and understand how the mask is incorrectly handled when one operand lacks a mask, we should focus on the `_arithmetic_mask` method. This method is where the logic for combining or propagating masks between operands is likely implemented, and understanding its implementation will be key to identifying the exact cause of the issue and devising a fix.\n\nTherefore, the bug location can be identified as follows:\n\n- **where are bug locations:** \n  - **buggy files:** `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`\n  - **buggy methods:** `_arithmetic_mask`\n\nTo proceed with the analysis and get a clearer picture of how the mask is handled, especially when one operand does not have a mask, we should examine the implementation of the `_arithmetic_mask` method:\n\n- **do we need more context:** \n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"_arithmetic_mask\", \"NDArithmeticMixin\")\n```"
