Specifically, we should focus on the parts of the code where the error occurs and the related functionalities. The error message \"Invalid comparison of complex I\" suggests that there's an issue with comparing a complex number, which is not supported in the given context. The traceback points us to several key areas in the code, including the `simplify`, `trigsimp`, and `fu` modules, along with specific methods like `_TR56`, `_futrig`, and the comparison operation in `expr.py`.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls will be useful to gather more context about the implementation and potentially identify the root cause of the issue:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")` - To understand how the `simplify` function is implemented and how it interacts with other components.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"trigsimp\", \"sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py\")` - To get details on the `trigsimp` function, which is directly involved in the traceback.\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"_TR56\", \"sympy/simplify/fu.py\")` - Since the error occurs in the `TR6` method which calls `_TR56`, understanding this method's implementation is crucial.\n4. `search_code_in_file(\"if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\", \"sympy/simplify/fu.py\")` - This specific line throws the error, so examining its context could reveal why the comparison with a complex number is attempted.\n5. `search_method_in_file(\"__lt__\", \"sympy/core/expr.py\")` - The error is raised during a less-than comparison, so it's important to understand how this operation is defined for expressions.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant parts of the codebase, allowing us to diagnose the issue more accurately and develop a suitable patch."

If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(1 - log(a)))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n\n    If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n    x belongs to the set where this relation is true. The default is\n    False.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    expr = sympify(expr)\n    kwargs = dict(ratio=ratio, measure=measure,\n        rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n\n    # no routine for Expr needs to check for is_zero\n    if isinstance(expr, Expr) and expr.is_zero and expr*0 is S.Zero:\n        return S.Zero\n\n    _eval_simplify = getattr(expr, '_eval_simplify', None)\n    if _eval_simplify is not None:\n        return _eval_simplify(ratio=ratio, measure=measure, rational=rational, inverse=inverse)\n\n    original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n\n    from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n    from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n    from sympy import Sum, Product, Integral\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n        return expr\n\n    if inverse and expr.has(Function):\n        expr = inversecombine(expr)\n        if not expr.args:  # simplified to atomic\n            return expr\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n        return expr.func(*[simplify(x, **kwargs) for x in expr.args])\n\n    if not expr.is_commutative:\n        expr = nc_simplify(expr)\n\n    # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n    # is it a purely rational function?

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we can start piecing together the situation that led to the issue. The error occurs when attempting to simplify an expression involving a complex exponent, specifically `cos(x)**I` where `I` is the imaginary unit in SymPy. The traceback points to a failure in handling this expression during the simplification process, particularly within the `fu.py` module's `_TR56` function.\n\n### Key Points from the Context:\n\n1. **Simplify Function**: The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is a general-purpose simplifier that applies various heuristics to reduce expressions to simpler forms. It delegates to more specific simplification functions based on the nature of the expression.\n\n2. **Trigsimp Function**: The `trigsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` is designed to simplify trigonometric expressions. It can use different methods, including a collection of trigonometric transformations described by Fu, et al., which is relevant to our issue.\n\n3. **_TR56 Function**: The `_TR56` function in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` is a helper for trigonometric simplifications. It attempts to replace powers of trigonometric functions with equivalent expressions based on known identities. The error occurs in this function when it checks if the exponent of a power expression is less than zero, which fails for complex numbers.\n\n4. **Comparison of Complex Numbers**: The `__lt__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` explicitly raises a `TypeError` when attempting to compare complex numbers, as complex numbers do not have a natural ordering. This is the direct cause of the error message seen in the traceback.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe issue arises because the `_TR56` function does not account for the possibility of complex exponents when performing its simplification logic. Specifically, the comparison `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` assumes that the exponent can be meaningfully compared to zero, which is not valid for complex numbers. This leads to an unhandled exception when the expression involves a complex exponent.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to modify the `_TR56` function to handle cases where the exponent is complex. This could involve bypassing certain transformations that are only valid for real exponents or introducing specific handling for complex exponents if appropriate simplifications exist for such cases. The exact approach will depend on the intended behavior of the `fu` module's trigonometric simplifications for complex exponents."
