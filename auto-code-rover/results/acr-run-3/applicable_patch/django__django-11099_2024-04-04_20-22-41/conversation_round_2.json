However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

This pattern is intended to allow only alphanumeric characters, along with `.`, `@`, `+`, and `-` characters. However, as pointed out in the issue, the use of `$` in the regex allows for a trailing newline character, which is not the intended behavior.\n\nTo address the issue, the regex patterns in both validators need to be updated from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This change will ensure that the username validation does not accept trailing newline characters, aligning with the intended validation logic.\n\nThe next step is to prepare patches for both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes in the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file, updating the `regex` attribute of each class with the corrected regex pattern."
