<original>        FigureCanvasBase(self)  # Set self.canvas.</original>
<patched>        if not hasattr(self, 'canvas') or self.canvas is None:
            FigureCanvasBase(self)  # Set self.canvas only if it's not already set.</patched>
```

**Explanation**: The patch adds a condition to check if the `canvas` attribute is already set on the `Figure` object before setting it again in the `__setstate__` method. This change aims to prevent the DPI value from being incorrectly adjusted or re-initialized in scenarios where the figure's canvas is already set, which could be contributing to the DPI doubling issue upon unpickling. This approach ensures that existing canvas settings, including DPI, are preserved unless the canvas is not previously set, addressing the issue without altering the expected behavior for new or unpickled figures without an existing canvas.
