This patch corrects the misleading hint in the `_check_relationship_model` method of the `ManyToManyField` class. It replaces the incorrect suggestion to use `ForeignKey` with the correct `ManyToManyField` for creating recursive relationships. Additionally, it removes the `symmetrical=False` argument, which is not required for `ManyToManyField` and is outdated information for recursive relationships with an intermediary model to self since Django 3.0.
