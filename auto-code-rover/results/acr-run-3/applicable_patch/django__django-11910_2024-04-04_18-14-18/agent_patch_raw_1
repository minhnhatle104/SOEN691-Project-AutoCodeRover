Given the information provided and the nature of the issue, the patch will focus on correcting the `ForeignKey` reference in `ModelB` to ensure it correctly points to the new primary key field name in `ModelA`. Since the specific migration files and operations were not directly identified, the patch will be conceptual and based on the provided models and the described issue. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the project's specific migration files and state.

# modification 1
```python
<file>tests/queries/models.py</file>
<original>class ModelB(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField()
    c = models.ForeignKey(ModelC, models.CASCADE)</original>
<patched>class ModelB(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField()
    # Assuming ModelC's ForeignKey should actually point to ModelA as per the issue description
    # and the field name in ModelA that ModelB's ForeignKey should refer to is 'field_fixed'
    c = models.ForeignKey(ModelA, on_delete=models.CASCADE, to_field='field_fixed')</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>app1/migrations/0002_auto.py</file>
<original>migrations.AlterField(
    model_name='modelb',
    name='modela',
    field=models.ForeignKey(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE, to='app1.ModelB', to_field='field_wrong'),
)</original>
<patched>migrations.AlterField(
    model_name='modelb',
    name='modela',
    field=models.ForeignKey(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE, to='app1.ModelA', to_field='field_fixed'),
)</patched>
```

Please note, the second modification is hypothetical and assumes the existence of a migration file (`0002_auto.py`) that attempts to alter the `ForeignKey` in `ModelB` incorrectly. The actual migration file name and the specific operation details (like `model_name`, `name`, and `to_field` values) might differ based on the project's migration history and structure. This modification aims to correct the `to_field` parameter to point to the new primary key field name (`field_fixed`) in `ModelA`, which is the essence of the reported issue.
