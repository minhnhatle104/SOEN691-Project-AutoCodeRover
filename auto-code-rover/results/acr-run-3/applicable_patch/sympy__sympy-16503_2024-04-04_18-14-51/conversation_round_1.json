The absence of a direct `pprint` method in the search results suggests that the pretty-printing functionality might be handled by a more generic method or through a series of methods that work together to generate the output.\n\nThe issue specifically mentions the misalignment of elements in the pretty-printed output of a mathematical sum expression. This indicates that the problem likely resides in the part of the code responsible for formatting mathematical expressions, particularly sums.\n\nSince the direct search for `pprint` did not yield results, we should consider looking for classes or methods that are likely involved in rendering or formatting expressions. This could include classes or methods related to mathematical expressions, sum operations, or pretty-printing in general.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it might be beneficial to search for classes or methods that are specifically designed to handle mathematical expressions or formatting. Here are a few potential search queries that could help us gather more context:\n\n1. Search for a class that might be responsible for handling mathematical expressions, such as `Expression` or `Sum`.\n2. Search for methods that are likely involved in the pretty-printing process, which might be named something like `format`, `render`, or `pretty`.\n\nLet's proceed with these searches to gather more context:\n\n1. search_class(\"Sum\")\n2. search_method(\"format\")\n3. search_method(\"render\")\n4. search_method(\"pretty\")"
