Given the issue description and the code provided, the problem seems to be related to the alignment of elements in the pretty-printed output, specifically for sum expressions. The issue does not appear to be directly addressed in the provided `pretty` and `render` method code snippets. However, the solution likely involves adjusting how these methods handle the formatting of expressions that include operations like summation followed by additional terms (e.g., `Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3`).

Since the exact mechanism for handling the alignment of different parts of an expression in the pretty-printing process is not clear from the provided snippets, a hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that when expressions are combined (like a sum and an additional term), their textual representations are aligned correctly. This might involve adjusting the rendering logic to account for the width of each part of the expression and ensuring they are joined with appropriate spacing.

Without specific details on the internal representation of expressions and how they are converted into their pretty-printed forms, the following is a speculative patch that aims to introduce a concept of alignment in the rendering process. This patch assumes that there might be a need to adjust the `render` method in `stringPict.py` to better handle alignment.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py</file>
<original>return "\n".join(svals)</original>
<patched># Adjust alignment for expressions with multiple parts
def align_expressions(lines):
    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)
    return [line.ljust(max_length) for line in lines]

# Apply alignment adjustment
aligned_svals = align_expressions(svals)
return "\n".join(aligned_svals)</patched>
```

This patch introduces a helper function `align_expressions` that ensures all parts of the expression are left-aligned by padding lines with spaces to match the length of the longest line. This is a speculative solution and might not directly address the specific issue if the misalignment is caused by other factors not visible in the provided code snippets. Further investigation into how expressions are decomposed and rendered in the pretty-printing process would be necessary for a precise fix.
