The absence of a direct `pprint` method in the search results suggests that the pretty-printing functionality might be handled by a more generic method or through a series of methods that work together to generate the output.\n\nThe issue specifically mentions the misalignment of elements in the pretty-printed output of a mathematical sum expression. This indicates that the problem likely resides in the part of the code responsible for formatting mathematical expressions, particularly sums.\n\nSince the direct search for `pprint` did not yield results, we should consider looking for classes or methods that are likely involved in rendering or formatting expressions. This could include classes or methods related to mathematical expressions, sum operations, or pretty-printing in general.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it might be beneficial to search for classes or methods that are specifically designed to handle mathematical expressions or formatting.

        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified several key pieces of information that will help us narrow down the location of the bug:\n\n1. **Sum Class**: The `Sum` class is located in `sympy/concrete/summations.py`. This class is likely involved in the issue since the problem description specifically mentions the pretty-printing of a `Sum` expression. The `Sum` class contains methods that could be relevant to the issue, such as `_eval_summation`, which might be involved in the calculation before the pretty-printing occurs. However, none of the methods listed directly suggest they are responsible for the formatting issue described.\n\n2. **Pretty Printing Methods**: The search for methods named `pretty` and `render` has pointed us towards files that are likely involved in the pretty-printing process. Specifically, `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` are of interest. The `pretty` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and the `render` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` are strong candidates for where the formatting issue might be occurring.\n\nGiven this context, we can make some educated guesses about where the bug locations might be:\n\n- **Bug Locations**:\n  - **Buggy Files and Methods**:\n    - The `Sum` class in `sympy/concrete/summations.py` might be involved, but it's more likely that the issue does not originate here since this class deals more with the computation rather than the presentation of sums.\n    - The `pretty` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` is a strong candidate for where the alignment issue in the pretty-printing process might be occurring. This method is likely responsible for generating the formatted string representation of various mathematical expressions, including sums.\n    - The `render` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` could also be involved in the issue, especially if this method handles the final assembly or adjustment of the pretty-printed output.\n\nTo proceed with fixing the issue, we would need to examine the implementation of the `pretty` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and the `render` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` to understand how they handle the formatting of sum expressions and identify why the alignment of elements is incorrect. Adjustments in these methods could potentially resolve the alignment issue described in the problem."

The issue does not appear to be directly addressed in the provided `pretty` and `render` method code snippets. However, the solution likely involves adjusting how these methods handle the formatting of expressions that include operations like summation followed by additional terms (e.g., `Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3`).\n\nSince the exact mechanism for handling the alignment of different parts of an expression in the pretty-printing process is not clear from the provided snippets, a hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that when expressions are combined (like a sum and an additional term), their textual representations are aligned correctly. This might involve adjusting the rendering logic to account for the width of each part of the expression and ensuring they are joined with appropriate spacing.\n\nWithout specific details on the internal representation of expressions and how they are converted into their pretty-printed forms, the following is a speculative patch that aims to introduce a concept of alignment in the rendering process. This patch assumes that there might be a need to adjust the `render` method in `stringPict.py` to better handle alignment.\n\n# modification 1\n```python\n<file>sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py</file>\n<original>return \"\\n\".join(svals)</original>\n<patched># Adjust alignment for expressions with multiple parts\ndef align_expressions(lines):\n    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)\n    return [line.ljust(max_length) for line in lines]\n\n# Apply alignment adjustment\naligned_svals = align_expressions(svals)\nreturn \"\\n\".join(aligned_svals)</patched>\n```\n\nThis patch introduces a helper function `align_expressions` that ensures all parts of the expression are left-aligned by padding lines with spaces to match the length of the longest line. This is a speculative solution and might not directly address the specific issue if the misalignment is caused by other factors not visible in the provided code snippets. Further investigation into how expressions are decomposed and rendered in the pretty-printing process would be necessary for a precise fix."
