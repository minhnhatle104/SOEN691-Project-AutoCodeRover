This patch attempts to address the issue by avoiding the direct use of `S(item.args[0]).is_negative`, which can lead to a `SympifyError` if `item.args[0]` cannot be sympified. Instead, it tries to access the `is_negative` attribute directly, which should be present for symbolic expressions that can meaningfully be checked for negativity. The `try-except` block is used to handle cases where `item.args[0]` does not have the `is_negative` attribute, avoiding the exception raised by sympify failure. This approach maintains the original logic's intent while mitigating the risk of encountering a `SympifyError` during pretty printing.
