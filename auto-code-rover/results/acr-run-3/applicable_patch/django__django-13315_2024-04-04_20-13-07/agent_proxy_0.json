            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how the `limit_choices_to` functionality is implemented and used within the ForeignKey field. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely related to the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, possibly within models or forms handling. Here are the API calls that would help in understanding the issue better:\n\n1. Search for the class that implements the ForeignKey field to understand its structure and current implementation:\n   - `search_class(\"ForeignKey\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem with form fields, it's also important to understand how the ForeignKey field is converted into formfield options. Therefore, we should look for a method that might be responsible for this conversion:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"formfield\", \"ForeignKey\")`\n\n3. The issue description mentions the use of a Q object with `limit_choices_to`, which suggests that the handling of Q objects in relation to filtering choices might be where the bug lies. Therefore, we should search for code snippets that involve `limit_choices_to` to see how it's implemented or used:\n   - `search_code(\"limit_choices_to\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and formulating a solution."
