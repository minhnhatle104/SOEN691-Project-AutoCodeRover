These modifications aim to address the issue by allowing `n_components` to accept any type that is an instance of `Integral` (which includes both Python's built-in `int` and NumPy integer types) and allowing `tol` to accept any type that is an instance of `Real` (which includes both Python's built-in `float` and NumPy float types). This approach should resolve the type strictness problem encountered during grid searches, as described in the issue.
