Specifically, we should look into the implementation of parameter checking in the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class to understand the current mechanism and its limitations. Additionally, examining a general parameter checking tool, if already introduced, would be beneficial to propose a comprehensive solution. \n\nGiven the information in the issue, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class**: This will help us understand how parameter checking is currently implemented in this class.\n   - `search_class(\"NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis\")`\n\n2. **Search for a general parameter checking tool**: Since the issue mentions the idea of a common parameter checking tool introduced with the NCA PR, we need to find if such a tool exists and how it is implemented.\n   - `search_code(\"check_param\")`\n\nThese calls will provide a good starting point for understanding the current state of parameter checking in the project and how it can be improved."
