The information obtained provides a clear understanding of where and how the `_build_app_dict` method is used and the significance of `app_list` in the Django admin. Any further steps would involve direct modifications or enhancements rather than additional context gathering.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n\nThe issue described does not directly point to a \"bug\" in the traditional sense but rather a feature enhancement or modification request. However, the relevant location for the proposed changes is:\n\n- **Buggy files and methods**:\n  - **File**: `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`\n  - **Method**: `_build_app_dict` within the `AdminSite` class. This method is not buggy per se but is identified for modification from private to public access to facilitate the issue's requirements."
