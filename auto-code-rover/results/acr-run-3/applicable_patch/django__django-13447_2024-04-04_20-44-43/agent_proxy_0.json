Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"_build_app_dict\")`: This will help identify where the `_build_app_dict` method is used across the project and understand its current access level and usage context.\n\n2. `search_code(\"app_list\")`: Since the issue mentions manipulating the `app_list` in a custom admin view, searching for the `app_list` code snippet will provide insights into how and where `app_list` is currently being used or modified in the project.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"index\", \"AdminView\")`: Assuming the class might be named something related to `AdminView` based on the context provided. This call will help understand how the `index` view is implemented.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"app_index\", \"AdminView\")`: Similar to the previous call, this will provide insights into how the `app_index` view is implemented, assuming it's part of the same or a similar class as the `index` view.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how the `app_list` is currently being handled and how the `_build_app_dict` method is implemented and used, allowing for an informed approach to addressing the issue."
