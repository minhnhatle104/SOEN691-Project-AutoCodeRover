If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided information from the `QuerySet` class and the `defer` and `only` methods within Django's ORM, we can start to understand the root cause of the issue and think about potential solutions.\n\n### Analysis of `defer` Method\nThe `defer` method is designed to defer the loading of specified fields until they are accessed. When fields are passed to `defer`, it adds them to a set of deferred fields, unless `None` is passed as the only parameter, which clears all deferrals. This behavior is crucial for understanding how deferred fields are managed internally.\n\n### Analysis of `only` Method\nThe `only` method essentially does the opposite of `defer`. It specifies that only the fields passed to this method (and not already deferred) should be loaded immediately when the queryset is evaluated. This method modifies the internal state to mark certain fields for immediate loading.\n\n### Issue at Hand\nThe issue arises when chaining `defer` and `only` methods together. Based on the user's expectation, chaining `only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")` should result in a query that loads only the `id` field, as `name` is deferred after being initially marked for immediate loading. However, the actual behavior results in all fields being loaded.\n\n### Potential Root Cause\nThe interaction between `defer` and `only` does not seem to account for the scenario where a field is first marked for immediate loading and then deferred. The internal state management within the `QuerySet` class likely does not handle this specific chaining in the expected manner, leading to the observed behavior.\n\n### Possible Solution Approach\nA solution would involve modifying the internal handling of deferred and immediately loaded fields within the `QuerySet` class to correctly process the scenario where a field's loading strategy is changed from immediate to deferred due to chaining of `only` and `defer`.\n\n1. **Adjust Internal State Management**: Enhance the logic within `QuerySet` to maintain a coherent state of fields marked for immediate loading and deferred loading, especially when modifications to this state are made through chaining.\n\n2. **Reevaluate Chaining Logic**: Specifically, when a field is passed to `defer` that is already marked for immediate loading by a preceding `only` call, the field should be removed from the set of fields marked for immediate loading.\n\n3. **Testing**: Extensive testing would be required to ensure that this change does not introduce regressions in other parts of the ORM, especially in how `QuerySet` evaluates and generates SQL queries.\n\nThis analysis provides a starting point for addressing the issue. Implementing a fix would require a detailed review of the `QuerySet` class's internal implementation, especially how deferred and immediate loading fields are tracked and managed."
