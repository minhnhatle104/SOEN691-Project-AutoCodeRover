Based on the provided context and the issue described, it seems the logic within `_eval_col_insert` for calculating the returned matrix's entries is correct. The issue might not be directly within the `_eval_col_insert` method itself but rather in how the positions are managed or an edge case that hasn't been considered in the provided logic. However, without a specific error in the logic being pointed out, and given the information we have, it's challenging to propose a specific patch that would resolve the issue described.

The issue describes an unexpected rearrangement of matrix elements after using `col_insert`, particularly affecting the identity matrix's structure. This suggests a potential misunderstanding in how the positions are calculated or an edge case not covered by the current logic. However, the provided code snippets do not show an obvious logical error that would lead to such behavior.

Given this, a hypothetical patch might involve adding additional checks or modifying the logic to ensure that the matrix's structure is preserved correctly after insertion. Without a clear bug or logical mistake identified in the provided code, the best course of action would be to add more comprehensive tests to replicate the issue described and then adjust the logic based on the findings of those tests.

Since we cannot pinpoint a specific error in the provided code snippets, we cannot provide a concrete patch. It would be advisable to:
1. Add more unit tests covering various cases of column insertion, especially edge cases.
2. Debug the method with specific inputs that lead to the described issue to identify any incorrect behavior in the logic.

For educational purposes, if there were a hypothetical issue in the logic for adjusting column indices, a patch might look like this:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/common.py</file>
<original>return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,
                         lambda i, j: entry(i, j))</original>
<patched># Hypothetical patch: Adjust the logic for handling column indices
# This is a placeholder and may not directly resolve the issue without further context
def adjusted_entry(i, j):
    if j < pos:
        return self[i, j]
    elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:
        return other[i, j - pos]
    else:
        return self[i, j - other.cols]

return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,
                 lambda i, j: adjusted_entry(i, j))</patched>
```

This modification is purely illustrative and not based on a specific identified error in the original code. It's intended to demonstrate how a patch might be structured rather than to suggest an actual fix for the issue described.
