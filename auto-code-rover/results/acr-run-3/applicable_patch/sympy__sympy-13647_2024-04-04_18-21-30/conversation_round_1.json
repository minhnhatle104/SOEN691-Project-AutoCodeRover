        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, it appears that there was an issue locating the `Matrix` class within the codebase. This could be due to several reasons, such as the class being part of a module that wasn't directly searchable with the provided API, the class being dynamically generated, or simply a mismatch in the class name due to version changes or refactoring.\n\nSince the direct search for the `Matrix` class and the `col_insert` method within it did not yield results, we might need to adjust our approach to gather the necessary context for debugging the issue. Here are a few alternative steps we can take:\n\n1. **Search by Method Name in the Entire Codebase**: Since the direct class search failed, searching for the method `col_insert` across the entire codebase might help locate the file or module where this method is implemented. This can give us a starting point to understand the context and implementation details.\n\n2. **Search for Code Snippets**: Given the specific behavior described in the issue, searching for code snippets that match parts of the implementation or usage of `col_insert` might help identify where the method is defined or used. This could include searching for parts of the method signature or specific lines of code mentioned in the issue.\n\n3. **Search for Related Terms**: If `Matrix` has been refactored or renamed, searching for related terms or alternative class names that could be associated with matrix operations in the codebase might help locate the correct class or module.\n\nGiven the limitations, let's proceed with the first alternative step to try and locate the `col_insert` method:\n\n- `search_method(\"col_insert\")`\n\nThis search aims to find any occurrence of the `col_insert` method in the codebase, which could lead us to the correct file or module where the method is implemented."
