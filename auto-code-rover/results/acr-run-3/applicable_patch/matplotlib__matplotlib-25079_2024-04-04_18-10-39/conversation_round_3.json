This could mean that the class might be part of a module that wasn't directly searchable through the provided API, or it could be an external dependency. Given that `LogNorm` is a normalization class used in matplotlib for logarithmic scaling, it's crucial for handling the `vmin` and `vmax` parameters correctly, especially in the context of the reported bug.\n\n2. **Method `update_scalarmappable` Not Found in `collections` Class**: The traceback provided in the issue points to an `update_scalarmappable` method call within a `collections.py` file, but the search for this method in the class `collections` returned no results. This could indicate a similar limitation in the search capability or that the context of the search was not accurately specified. The `update_scalarmappable` method is likely responsible for updating the color mapping based on the new normalization parameters, which is a critical part of the bug being reported.\n\n3. **Multiple `draw` Methods Found**: The search for the `draw` method returned 86 matches across various files in the matplotlib codebase. This indicates that drawing is a fundamental operation performed by many components within matplotlib, which aligns with the nature of the library as a plotting tool. The traceback in the issue description suggests that the error occurs during the drawing process, specifically after attempting to update the norm and redraw the plot.\n\nGiven these points, the next steps in addressing the issue would involve a deeper understanding of how the `LogNorm` class is supposed to interact with the plotting components, particularly how it's supposed to be set or updated after a plot has already been drawn. Additionally, understanding the role of the `update_scalarmappable` method in this process is crucial, as it seems to be directly involved in the error.\n\nSince the direct search for `LogNorm` and `update_scalarmappable` did not yield results, a potential approach could involve looking into how normalization parameters are generally handled within the plotting and color mapping processes in matplotlib. This could involve examining the implementation of similar normalization classes or methods that are successfully found in the codebase, or reviewing the documentation and usage examples of `LogNorm` and color mapping updates in matplotlib to identify any changes or deprecations that might have occurred with version 3.6.3."

Specifically, we should look into how normalization classes like `LogNorm` are integrated into the matplotlib plotting process and how they interact with colorbars and the drawing mechanism. Given the limitations encountered in the initial search, we might need to adjust our approach to gather this context. However, without the ability to directly execute more targeted search API calls or access the codebase directly, I'll outline the types of information that would be beneficial:\n\n1. Search for how normalization classes are used within the plotting process, specifically in relation to colorbars. This could involve searching for methods or classes related to colorbar creation and update processes.\n   \n2. Investigate any recent changes to the `LogNorm` class or related normalization and color mapping classes in the matplotlib changelog or documentation, especially between versions 3.6.2 and 3.6.3, to identify any modifications that could have introduced the bug.\n\n3. Examine the implementation of the color mapping update process, possibly by looking into methods related to setting or updating the norm of a plot, to understand how these updates are supposed to interact with existing colorbars.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**: Without direct access to the codebase or detailed search results for the specific methods and classes involved, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact locations of the bug.

The inability to find the `LogNorm` class, the `update_scalarmappable` method within `collections.py`, and references to `vmin` and `vmax` parameters through the search API indicates a limitation in our current approach to locating the source of the bug. Here's an analysis based on the information we have and the search results:\n\n### Analysis of Search Results\n\n1. **Class `LogNorm` Not Found**: The search API's inability to locate the `LogNorm` class suggests that either the class is part of a module not indexed by the search or that there's a discrepancy in how the class is referenced or located within the codebase. `LogNorm` is a critical component for handling logarithmic normalization, and understanding its implementation is key to resolving the issue.\n\n2. **Method `update_scalarmappable` Not Found**: Similarly, the search for `update_scalarmappable` in `collections.py` did not yield results. This method is likely crucial for updating the scalar mappable object (which includes handling of color mapping based on the norm) when the norm is changed. The traceback provided in the issue points to this method as part of the error sequence, indicating its importance in the bug context.\n\n3. **Search for `vmin` and `vmax` Parameters**: The inability to find references to `vmin` and `vmax` parameters suggests that the search might not be capturing the context of how these parameters are used within normalization classes or methods. These parameters are fundamental to setting the bounds for normalization, including `LogNorm`.\n\n### Implications and Next Steps\n\nGiven the limitations in directly accessing the necessary parts of the codebase, we might need to adopt a different strategy to understand and address the issue:\n\n- **Review Documentation and Changelogs**: Since direct code access is limited, reviewing the official matplotlib documentation, especially the changelog between versions 3.6.2 and 3.6.3, could provide insights into changes that might have affected the behavior of `LogNorm`, the handling of `vmin` and `vmax`, or the `update_scalarmappable` process.\n\n- **Community and Source Code**: Engaging with the matplotlib community through forums or issue trackers, and reviewing the source code directly on platforms like GitHub, could provide the necessary context and insights into the bug. This approach could reveal recent commits or discussions related to the issue.\n\n- **Debugging and Testing**: Implementing a debugging session where the code is stepped through during execution could reveal how `LogNorm`, `vmin` and `vmax`, and the `update_scalarmappable` method interact. Additionally, creating minimal reproducible examples that isolate the behavior could help in understanding the issue's scope.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout direct access to the specific implementations and references within the matplotlib codebase, we're constrained in pinpointing the exact location and cause of the bug. However, the strategies outlined above offer alternative paths to gather the necessary context and potentially identify and resolve the issue."
