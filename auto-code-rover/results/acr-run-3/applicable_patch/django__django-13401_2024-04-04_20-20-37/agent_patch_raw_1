# modification 3
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>    def __lt__(self, other):
        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter
        return NotImplemented</original>
<patched>    def __lt__(self, other):
        # Adjusted to consider the model of the field for ordering
        if isinstance(other, Field):
            if self.model == other.model:
                return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter
            return str(self.model) < str(other.model)
        return NotImplemented</patched>
```

These modifications adjust the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class to consider the model of the field in their operations. This ensures that fields from different models are treated as distinct, even if they have the same `creation_counter`, addressing the issue described.
