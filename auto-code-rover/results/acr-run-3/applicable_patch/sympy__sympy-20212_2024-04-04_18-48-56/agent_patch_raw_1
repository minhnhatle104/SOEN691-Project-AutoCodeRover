This patch introduces a condition to handle the specific case of `0**-oo` within the `_eval_power` method of the `Pow` class. By checking if the base (`b`) is `0`, the exponent (`e`) is negative, and the exponent is infinite, the method can correctly return `ComplexInfinity` (`S.ComplexInfinity`) for this case, aligning with the documented behavior. This condition is checked before the existing logic that evaluates other power expressions, ensuring that it does not interfere with other operations.
