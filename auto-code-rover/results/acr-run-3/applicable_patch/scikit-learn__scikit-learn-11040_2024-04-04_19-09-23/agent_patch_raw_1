```

This patch adds a type check for the `n_neighbors` parameter in the `kneighbors` method of the `KNeighborsMixin` class. If `n_neighbors` is not an integer, a `TypeError` is raised with a clear message. This approach ensures that the parameter is validated early in the method's execution, providing users with immediate feedback if they pass a float or any other type that cannot be interpreted as an integer for the `n_neighbors` parameter. This solution opts for strict type checking over lenient casting to maintain consistency and predictability in the method's behavior.
