        "content": "<issue>Bug in expand of TensorProduct + Workaround + Fix\n### Error description\nThe expansion of a TensorProduct object stops incomplete if summands in the tensor product factors have (scalar) factors, e.g.\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum import *\nU = Operator('U')\nV = Operator('V')\nP = TensorProduct(2*U - V, U + V)\nprint(P)\n# (2*U - V)x(U + V)\nprint(P.expand(tensorproduct=True))\n#result: 2*Ux(U + V) - Vx(U + V) #expansion has missed 2nd tensor factor and is incomplete\n```\nThis is clearly not the expected behaviour. It also effects other functions that rely on .expand(tensorproduct=True), as e.g. qapply() .\n### Work around\nRepeat .expand(tensorproduct=True) as may times as there are tensor factors, resp. until the expanded term does no longer change. This is however only reasonable in interactive session and not in algorithms.\n### Code Fix\n.expand relies on the method TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct(). The issue arises from an inprecise check in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() whether a recursive call is required; it fails when the creation of a TensorProduct object returns commutative (scalar) factors up front: in that case the constructor returns a Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..)).\nI thus propose the following  code fix in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() in quantum/tensorproduct.py.  I have marked the four lines to be added / modified:\n```\ndef _eval_expand_tensorproduct(self, **hints):\n...\nfor aa in args[i].args:\ntp = TensorProduct(*args[:i] + (aa,) + args[i + 1:])\nc_part, nc_part = tp.args_cnc() #added\nif len(nc_part)==1 and isinstance(nc_part[0], TensorProduct): #modified\nnc_part = (nc_part[0]._eval_expand_tensorproduct(), ) #modified\nadd_args.append(Mul(*c_part)*Mul(*nc_part)) #modified\nbreak\n...\n```\nThe fix splits of commutative (scalar) factors from the tp returned. The TensorProduct object will be the one nc factor in nc_part (see TensorProduct.__new__ constructor), if any. Note that the constructor will return 0 if a tensor factor is 0, so there is no guarantee that tp contains a TensorProduct object (e.g. TensorProduct(U-U, U+V).\n</issue>"
