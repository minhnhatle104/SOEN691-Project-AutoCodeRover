            "content": "To address the issue described, it seems that the core problem is related to the `Pipeline` class not implementing the `__len__` method, which is causing an error when attempting to use `len(pipe)`. Given this, the suspicious methods identified by the external analysis tool, while potentially relevant for a comprehensive review, do not directly point to the implementation of the `__len__` method in the `Pipeline` class. Therefore, the most relevant action is to investigate the `Pipeline` class to understand its current implementation and identify where the `__len__` method could be added or modified.\n\nBased on the description of the issue, I will use the following search API calls to gather more context about the `Pipeline` class and its current implementation:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Pipeline\")`: This will help to find the `Pipeline` class in the codebase and understand its current structure and methods.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__len__\", \"Pipeline\")`: This will help to check if the `__len__` method is already implemented in the `Pipeline` class and how it is currently implemented if it exists.\n\nThese searches will provide the necessary context to understand the current implementation of the `Pipeline` class and how to approach adding or modifying the `__len__` method to resolve the issue."
