<patched>class SimpleLazyObject(LazyObject):
    def __init__(self, func):
        # Existing initialization code

    def _setup(self):
        # Existing setup code

    def __repr__(self):
        # Existing repr code

    def __copy__(self):
        # Existing copy code

    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        # Existing deepcopy code

    def __radd__(self, other):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            self._setup()
        return other + self._wrapped
</patched>
```

Note: Since the original code snippet to be modified was not explicitly provided, the patch includes the addition of the `__radd__` method to the `SimpleLazyObject` class. The use of `empty` in the `__radd__` method is a placeholder for the actual mechanism used within `SimpleLazyObject` to determine if the `_wrapped` attribute is uninitialized. This should be replaced with the correct approach used in the class for checking the initialization state of `_wrapped`.
