<original>class SimpleLazyObject(LazyObject):

    def _setup(self):

    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
</original>
<patched>class SimpleLazyObject(LazyObject):
    def __init__(self, func):
    def _setup(self):
    def __repr__(self):
    def __copy__(self):
    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
    
    def __radd__(self, other):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            self._setup()
        return other + self._wrapped
</patched>
```

Note: The `empty` in the `__radd__` method needs to be replaced with the actual mechanism used in `SimpleLazyObject` to check if the `_wrapped` attribute is uninitialized. This is typically a placeholder or sentinel value used within the class to indicate an uninitialized state. The exact implementation detail of `empty` was not provided in the context, so it should be adapted to match the existing codebase's approach to handling uninitialized lazy objects.
