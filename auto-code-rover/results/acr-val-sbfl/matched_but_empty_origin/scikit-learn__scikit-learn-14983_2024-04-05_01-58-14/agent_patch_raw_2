Given the feedback, it appears there was a misunderstanding in matching the original program's structure for the patch. Let's adjust the approach based on the structure of the classes `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` as they inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`. Since the direct `__repr__` implementations in these classes were not originally present, and considering the structure of the provided code snippets, the modifications should focus on adding a `__repr__` method correctly without altering existing `__init__` methods. Here's a revised attempt:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sklearn/model_selection/_split.py</file>
<original></original>
<patched>class RepeatedKFold(_RepeatedSplits):
    def __init__(self, n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None):
        super(RepeatedKFold, self).__init__(n_splits=n_splits, n_repeats=n_repeats, random_state=random_state)
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})"</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sklearn/model_selection/_split.py</file>
<original></original>
<patched>class RepeatedStratifiedKFold(_RepeatedSplits):
    def __init__(self, n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None):
        super(RepeatedStratifiedKFold, self).__init__(n_splits=n_splits, n_repeats=n_repeats, random_state=random_state)
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(n_splits={self.n_splits}, n_repeats={self.n_repeats}, random_state={self.random_state})"</patched>
```

These modifications explicitly add a `__repr__` method to both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes without altering the original `__init__` methods provided in the search results. This approach ensures that instances of these classes will have a meaningful string representation, addressing the issue reported.
