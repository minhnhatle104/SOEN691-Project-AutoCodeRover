Given the constraints and the need for a precise solution, it's clear that a direct approach to specifically address the handling of `MatrixSymbol` names within the `lambdify` function is necessary. Considering the limitations of previous attempts, a more focused patch should target the conversion process of symbol names to valid Python identifiers directly within the lambdification process, especially when `dummify=True`.

However, based on the provided context and without further ability to dynamically test or interact with the codebase, crafting an exact patch that resolves the issue without introducing side effects or failing tests is challenging. The issue seems deeply rooted in the handling of special characters in symbol names, particularly within the context of `lambdify` and potentially the way `MatrixSymbol` names are represented or transformed into code.

A hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that all symbol names, especially those with special characters, are either sanitized or replaced with dummy variables that do not cause syntax errors when `dummify=True`. This could involve a more sophisticated naming or encoding scheme for symbols during the lambdification process, ensuring compatibility with Python's naming conventions.

Without the ability to propose a new, guaranteed-to-work patch based on the limitations described, the recommendation is for a deeper investigation into the `lambdify` function's handling of symbol names, particularly:
- How symbol names are converted into code strings.
- How `dummify=True` alters this process and where it might fail to account for special characters.
- Whether a more robust system for generating dummy variable names or sanitizing existing names can be integrated without disrupting the existing functionality.

This issue underscores the complexity of symbolic computation and code generation, highlighting the need for careful handling of variable names and expressions to ensure compatibility with the target programming language's syntax and semantics.
