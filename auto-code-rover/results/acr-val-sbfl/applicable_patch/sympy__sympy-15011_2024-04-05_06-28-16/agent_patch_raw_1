Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential patch could involve ensuring that `MatrixSymbol` names are properly handled when `dummify=True` is specified in `lambdify`. Since the issue arises from special characters in `MatrixSymbol` names, a straightforward approach could be to enhance the dummification process to handle these cases more gracefully. However, without a clear indication that changes are needed directly in the `MatrixSymbol.__new__` method, the focus will be on adjusting the `lambdify` function to better manage special characters in symbol names.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file>
<original>funcprinter = _EvaluatorPrinter(printer, dummify)</original>
<patched>funcprinter = _EvaluatorPrinter(printer, True if dummify or "{" in str(args) else False)</patched>
```

Explanation: This modification forces the dummification process to activate not only when `dummify=True` is explicitly passed but also when the `args` contain a `MatrixSymbol` with a name that includes curly braces. This is a heuristic approach to ensure that symbols with potentially problematic names are treated cautiously. It's a workaround that targets the specific issue described, recognizing that a more comprehensive solution might require a deeper refactoring of how symbols and their names are handled across `lambdify` and `MatrixSymbol`.

Note: This patch assumes that the presence of curly braces in symbol names is relatively rare and primarily problematic in the context described. If curly braces in symbol names are common and valid in other contexts, a more nuanced approach to detecting and handling problematic cases would be necessary. Additionally, this patch does not modify the `MatrixSymbol.__new__` method directly, as the issue seems to stem more from how `lambdify` handles these symbols rather than how they are created. Further investigation and testing would be required to ensure that this patch fully resolves the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
