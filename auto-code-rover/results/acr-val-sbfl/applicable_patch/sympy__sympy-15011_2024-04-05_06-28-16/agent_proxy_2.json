To refine our understanding and pinpoint the exact locations of the bugs, I will focus on how `MatrixSymbol` names are processed and how `lambdify` handles these names, especially with `dummify=True`. This involves looking into the implementation details of the `MatrixSymbol` class, particularly how names are set and used, and the dummification process within `lambdify`.\n\nTo get more context and refine the bug locations, I will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. search_method_in_class(\"__new__\", \"MatrixSymbol\")\n2. search_method_in_class(\"_hashable_content\", \"MatrixSymbol\")\n3. search_code(\"dummify=True\", \"sympy/utilities/lambdify.py\")\n\nThese searches aim to provide detailed insights into the creation and handling of `MatrixSymbol` instances, especially with special characters in their names, and how `lambdify`'s dummification process works, which could be failing in this specific case."
