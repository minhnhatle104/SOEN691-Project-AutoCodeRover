Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, a more nuanced approach is required. The core of the issue lies in the handling of `MatrixSymbol` names within `lambdify`, especially when these names contain characters that are not valid in Python variable names, such as curly braces. A more direct approach would involve modifying the `lambdify` function to ensure it can handle such cases appropriately, especially under the `dummify=True` condition.

Considering the failure of the initial patch, a better approach might involve directly sanitizing the names of the symbols when `dummify=True` is specified, ensuring that all symbols, including those within `MatrixSymbol`, are converted into valid Python identifiers.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file>
<original>namespace.update({str(term): term})</original>
<patched>if dummify:
    sanitized_name = re.sub(r'\W|^(?=\d)', '_', str(term))
    namespace.update({sanitized_name: term})
else:
    namespace.update({str(term): term})</patched>
```

Explanation: This modification introduces a conditional check within the `lambdify` function to determine if `dummify` is `True`. If so, it sanitizes the names of the terms (symbols) by replacing any non-word characters (anything not a letter, digit, or underscore) or leading digits with underscores. This ensures that the names used in the namespace are valid Python identifiers, thus avoiding syntax errors when these names are part of a generated lambda function. The `re.sub(r'\W|^(?=\d)', '_', str(term))` regular expression is used for this purpose, where `\W` matches any character that is not a word character, and `^(?=\d)` matches a position followed by a digit at the beginning of the string, ensuring that names starting with digits are also sanitized.

Note: This solution focuses on modifying the `lambdify` function's behavior when `dummify=True` is specified, directly addressing the issue of handling special characters in symbol names. It assumes that the primary concern is the generation of valid Python code from symbols with potentially problematic names. Further testing would be necessary to ensure that this approach resolves the issue without introducing new problems, especially in complex expressions involving multiple symbols and operations.
