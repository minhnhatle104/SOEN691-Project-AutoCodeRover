            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to examine the implementation details of the methods identified as suspicious by the external analysis tool. Specifically, I will focus on the `empty_form` method in the `BaseFormSet` class, as the issue directly relates to how `empty_form` handles `form_kwargs` with `empty_permitted`. Additionally, I will look into the `get_form_kwargs` method in the same class, as it might be involved in how `form_kwargs` are processed or passed around, which could be relevant to solving the issue.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")` - This will provide insights into how the `empty_form` property is implemented, which is crucial for understanding why the `KeyError` occurs when `empty_permitted` is passed.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get_form_kwargs\", \"BaseFormSet\")` - This will help understand how `form_kwargs` are generated or modified within the `BaseFormSet` class, which could be relevant to the issue at hand."
