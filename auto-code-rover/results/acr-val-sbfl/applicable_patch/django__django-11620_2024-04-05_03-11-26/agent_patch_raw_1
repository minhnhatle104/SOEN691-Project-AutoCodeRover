Given the issue description and the analysis of the Django framework's handling of `Http404` exceptions in path converters, let's propose a theoretical patch. This patch aims to enhance the handling of `Http404` exceptions raised within a path converter's `to_python` method, especially when `DEBUG` is `True`, to provide more informative debug responses.

### Modification 1: Enhance `RoutePattern.match` to Catch `Http404`

The goal is to modify the `RoutePattern.match` method in `django/urls/resolvers.py` to catch `Http404` exceptions and handle them similarly to `ValueError`, signaling that the path does not match.

```python
<file>django/urls/resolvers.py</file>
<original>    def match(self, path):
        match = self.regex.search(path)
        if match:
            # RoutePattern doesn't allow non-named groups so args are ignored.
            kwargs = match.groupdict()
            for key, value in kwargs.items():
                converter = self.converters[key]
                try:
                    kwargs[key] = converter.to_python(value)
                except ValueError:
                    return None
            return path[match.end():], (), kwargs
        return None
</original>
<patched>    def match(self, path):
        match = self.regex.search(path)
        if match:
            # RoutePattern doesn't allow non-named groups so args are ignored.
            kwargs = match.groupdict()
            for key, value in kwargs.items():
                converter = self.converters[key]
                try:
                    kwargs[key] = converter.to_python(value)
                except (ValueError, Http404) as e:
                    if isinstance(e, Http404) and settings.DEBUG:
                        raise
                    return None
            return path[match.end():], (), kwargs
        return None
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Update `technical_404_response` to Include Converter Error Details

Enhance the `technical_404_response` in `django/views/debug.py` to include details about the converter error when a `Http404` is raised from a path converter.

```python
<file>django/views/debug.py</file>
<original>    urlconf = getattr(request, 'urlconf', settings.ROOT_URLCONF)
    if isinstance(urlconf, types.ModuleType):
        urlconf = urlconf.__name__
</original>
<patched>    urlconf = getattr(request, 'urlconf', settings.ROOT_URLCONF)
    converter_error = getattr(exception, 'converter_error', None)
    if isinstance(urlconf, types.ModuleType):
        urlconf = urlconf.__name__
</patched>
```

And then, further down in the same function, add the `converter_error` to the context if it exists:

```python
<original>        'settings': get_safe_settings(),
        'raising_view_name': caller,
</original>
<patched>        'settings': get_safe_settings(),
        'converter_error': converter_error,
        'raising_view_name': caller,
</patched>
```

### Note:

This patch is theoretical and aims to address the issue based on the context provided and a general understanding of Django's URL resolution and exception handling mechanisms. Before implementing, this patch should be thoroughly reviewed and tested in a development environment. Additionally, contributing such changes back to Django would require following the project's contribution guidelines, including writing tests and documentation for the new behavior.
