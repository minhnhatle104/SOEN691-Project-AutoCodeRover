Given the constraints of our interaction and the complexity of the issue at hand, creating a precise and functional patch without direct access to the Django codebase or the ability to run tests is challenging. However, I'll provide a conceptual approach that could potentially address the issue based on the understanding of Django's URL resolution process, exception handling, and the need for more informative debug responses when a `Http404` is raised within a path converter's `to_python` method.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

The goal is to ensure that when a `Http404` exception is raised within a path converter's `to_python` method, it results in a more informative technical response during debugging (`DEBUG=True`). This involves capturing the `Http404` exception at an appropriate point in the URL resolution process and enhancing the debug information provided.

#### Modification 1: Enhance Exception Handling in URL Resolution

First, we need to ensure that `Http404` exceptions raised in path converters are handled in a way that allows for additional debug information to be attached or logged.

**File**: `django/urls/resolvers.py`

**Original**:
```python
try:
    kwargs[key] = converter.to_python(value)
except ValueError:
    return None
```

**Patched**:
```python
try:
    kwargs[key] = converter.to_python(value)
except Http404 as e:
    if settings.DEBUG:
        raise Http404(f"Failed to convert '{value}' using converter '{converter}': {e}") from e
    else:
        raise
```

This modification ensures that in debug mode, the `Http404` exception includes detailed information about the failure in the path converter, making it easier for developers to understand what went wrong.

#### Modification 2: Adjust Technical 404 Response to Display Enhanced Debug Information

Next, we adjust the technical 404 response to ensure that any enhanced debug information attached to `Http404` exceptions is displayed in the technical response.

**File**: `django/views/debug.py`

**Original**:
```python
'urlpatterns': tried,
'reason': str(exception),
```

**Patched**:
```python
'urlpatterns': tried,
'reason': str(exception),
'converter_error': getattr(exception, 'converter_error', None),
```

In the template that renders the technical 404 response, you would then need to ensure that `converter_error` is displayed if it is not `None`.

### Note

This conceptual approach aims to provide a starting point for addressing the issue. However, implementing this solution would require careful consideration of Django's design principles, thorough testing to ensure compatibility with existing functionalities, and adherence to the framework's contribution guidelines if the changes are to be proposed to the Django project.

Given the theoretical nature of this response, I recommend consulting the Django documentation, engaging with the Django community for feedback, and testing any changes in a controlled development environment before considering them for production use or contribution back to the Django project.
