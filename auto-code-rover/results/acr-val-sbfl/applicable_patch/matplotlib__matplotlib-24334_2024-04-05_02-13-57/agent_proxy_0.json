            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the methods and classes involved. Specifically, we should look into the `set_xticks` method in the `Axes` class and the `set_ticks` method in the `Axis` class. Additionally, understanding how `kwargs` are handled in these methods will be crucial. Let's start by searching for these methods and any relevant code snippets that handle `kwargs`.\n\nI will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"set_xticks\", \"Axes\")` - This will help us understand how the `set_xticks` method is implemented in the `Axes` class and how it deals with `kwargs`.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"set_ticks\", \"Axis\")` - This will provide insights into the implementation of the `set_ticks` method in the `Axis` class, focusing on the handling of `kwargs`.\n\n3. `search_code(\"kwargs\")` - Since the issue mentions that `kwargs` should be validated even when `labels` are not set, searching for code snippets that handle `kwargs` could reveal where the validation logic might be missing or needs enhancement."
