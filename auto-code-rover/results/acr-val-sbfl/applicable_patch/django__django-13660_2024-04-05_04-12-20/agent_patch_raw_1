# modification 2
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/shell.py</file>
<original>            exec(sys.stdin.read())
            return</original>
<patched>            exec(sys.stdin.read(), {'__builtins__': __builtins__, 'django': django})
            return</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The modifications address the issue by providing a minimal set of globals for the `exec` function to use when executing the command passed with `-c` or reading from stdin. This ensures that the executed code has access to necessary modules and built-ins.
- In the patched version, a dictionary containing `__builtins__` and `django` is passed as the global scope to `exec`. This allows the executed code to access built-in functions and the Django module, which should resolve the `NameError` mentioned in the issue.
- Note: The patch assumes that the `django` module is imported at the top of the `shell.py` file. If it's not already imported, an import statement (`import django`) should be added at the beginning of the file.
