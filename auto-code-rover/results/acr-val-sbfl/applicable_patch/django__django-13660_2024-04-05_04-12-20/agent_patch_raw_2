Given the feedback and the need to correctly address the issue without causing test failures, a revised approach is necessary. The initial suggestion may have been too simplistic or not adequately aligned with Django's architecture and execution environment. A more appropriate solution would involve ensuring that the executed code has access to the correct global and local scope without making assumptions about specific imports.

Considering the nature of the issue, which involves executing code in a way that respects the defined functions and imports within that code, the correct approach is to modify the `exec` usage to include a proper execution context. The issue description suggests passing a new, empty dictionary as the second argument to `exec`, which would serve as the global scope. However, to ensure that the executed code has access to all necessary built-ins and the current global scope, we should pass `globals()` to `exec`. This will provide a more comprehensive solution that doesn't rely on hardcoded imports or assumptions about the execution environment.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/shell.py</file>
<original>            exec(options['command'])
            return</original>
<patched>            exec(options['command'], globals())
            return</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/shell.py</file>
<original>            exec(sys.stdin.read())
            return</original>
<patched>            exec(sys.stdin.read(), globals())
            return</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The modifications now use `globals()` as the second argument to `exec`, providing the executed code with access to the current global scope. This includes all imported modules and defined variables, ensuring that the code executed via `-c` or stdin behaves as expected.
- This approach avoids making specific assumptions about what needs to be imported or available in the scope, making it more flexible and less prone to errors or omissions.
- It's important to note that using `globals()` will include the entire current global scope, which is a more inclusive solution than the initial patch. This should address the issue without introducing the risk of test failures due to missing context or references.
