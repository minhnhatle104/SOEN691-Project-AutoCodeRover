These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that when unknown categories are encountered, and the `handle_unknown` parameter is set to 'ignore', the code safely handles string categories of varying lengths without causing memory issues or value truncation. The first modification ensures that the array `Xi` is converted to an object array if it contains Unicode strings, allowing for the safe assignment of longer strings. The second modification provides a workaround for the `ValueError` raised in `_encode_numpy` by checking the `handle_unknown` attribute, which is not directly accessible at that point in the code. The third modification is similar to the first but placed in a different part of the `_transform` method to ensure consistency in handling arrays of strings.
