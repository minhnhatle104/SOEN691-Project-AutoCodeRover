Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more accurately, let's refine the approach to ensure that `socket.error` exceptions are handled appropriately within the context of the `requests` library. The goal is to catch these exceptions closer to their source and wrap them in a way that's consistent with the library's design, specifically using `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

### Revised Patch

Upon further consideration, the initial attempt to wrap `socket.error` directly in the `build_response` method might not be the most effective approach, as this method primarily deals with constructing a response object from a successful request. Instead, the focus should be on error handling during the request execution phase, which is more likely to encounter `socket.error`.

Additionally, the modification in `iter_content` should ensure that it doesn't interfere with the method's primary functionality of iterating over response content. The handling of `socket.error` should be done in a way that it's caught when the request is made or when the response is being streamed, which is before `iter_content` is called.

Given this, let's adjust the approach to focus on the request execution phase, which is likely handled in the adapter layer (`requests/adapters.py`), specifically in methods that execute the request and handle the response stream.

# Revised Modification
```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>            for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
                        yield chunk</original>
<patched>            try:
                for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
                    yield chunk
            except socket.error as e:
                raise requests.exceptions.ConnectionError(e)</patched>
```

This modification targets the streaming of response content, which is a more appropriate place to handle `socket.error`. By wrapping the streaming operation in a `try-except` block, any `socket.error` encountered during streaming can be caught and re-raised as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This ensures that the exception handling is consistent with the expectations for the `requests` library, providing a more intuitive interface for handling network-related errors.

Note: The original patch attempted to directly modify `iter_content` and `build_response`, which might not have been the most effective points for addressing the issue. The revised approach focuses on the streaming operation, which is more directly involved in the network communication process and thus a more appropriate point to handle `socket.error`.
