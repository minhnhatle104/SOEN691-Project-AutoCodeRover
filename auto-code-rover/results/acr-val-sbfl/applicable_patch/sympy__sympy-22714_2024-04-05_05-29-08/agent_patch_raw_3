Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears my previous attempts to directly manipulate the evaluation context within the `Point2D` constructor were not successful. The issue seems to be more nuanced, possibly involving deeper aspects of the evaluation mechanism in SymPy that were not correctly addressed in the patches.

Without the ability to directly test and iterate on the codebase, and based on the information provided, creating a precise and effective patch is challenging. The issue likely involves complex interactions between the evaluation context, the `Point2D` constructor, and possibly other parts of the SymPy library that were not explicitly covered in the provided context.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the SymPy documentation and source code related to evaluation contexts, the `Point` and `Point2D` classes, and their interaction with the global evaluation state.
- Setting up a local development environment to reproduce the issue, allowing for direct testing of changes and the ability to run the full test suite to check for unintended side effects.
- Collaborating with other developers, possibly through the SymPy project's issue tracker or forums, to gather insights and advice on addressing this specific issue.

Given these limitations, I'm unable to provide another patch attempt without further context or the ability to interact with the codebase more dynamically. I recommend consulting the SymPy documentation, source code, and community resources for further guidance on resolving this issue.
