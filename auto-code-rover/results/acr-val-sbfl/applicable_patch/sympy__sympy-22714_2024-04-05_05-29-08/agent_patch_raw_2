Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more accurately, let's revise the approach. The initial patch attempted to manipulate the evaluation context directly within the `Point2D` constructor, which might not have been the correct approach or there was a mistake in the implementation details. Let's focus on ensuring that the evaluation context is correctly applied when `Point2D` objects are being instantiated, especially when `evaluate=False` is explicitly specified.

<file>sympy/geometry/point.py</file>

    if not _nocheck:
        kwargs['dim'] = 2
        args = Point(*args, **kwargs)
    return GeometryEntity.__new__(cls, *args)</original>
<patched>def __new__(cls, *args, _nocheck=False, **kwargs):
    if not _nocheck:
        kwargs['dim'] = 2
        # Temporarily set global evaluation to False if evaluate keyword is False
        evaluate_kwarg = kwargs.pop('evaluate', True)
        if not evaluate_kwarg:
            from sympy.core.parameters import global_parameters
            with global_parameters.evaluate(False):
                args = Point(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            args = Point(*args, **kwargs)
    return GeometryEntity.__new__(cls, *args)</patched>
```

Explanation:
- This revised patch focuses on correctly handling the `evaluate` keyword argument within the `Point2D` constructor. The key change is the conditional handling of the `evaluate` keyword argument.
- The `kwargs.pop('evaluate', True)` line extracts the `evaluate` flag from the keyword arguments, defaulting to `True` if it's not provided. This ensures backward compatibility with code that does not explicitly specify the `evaluate` flag.
- If `evaluate` is explicitly set to `False`, the patch uses the `with global_parameters.evaluate(False):` context manager to temporarily disable global evaluation while the `Point` constructor is called. This ensures that the evaluation state is correctly applied during the instantiation of `Point2D` objects.
- After extracting the `evaluate` keyword, the rest of the keyword arguments (`kwargs`) are passed unchanged to the `Point` constructor, preserving the intended behavior for other arguments.
- This approach aims to fix the issue by ensuring that the evaluation context is correctly managed within the `Point2D` constructor, specifically addressing the problem when `evaluate=False` is specified.
