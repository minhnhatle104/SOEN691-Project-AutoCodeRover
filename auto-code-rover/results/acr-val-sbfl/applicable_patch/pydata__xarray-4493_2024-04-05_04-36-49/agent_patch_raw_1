Given the context and the issue at hand, the primary goal of the patch would be to ensure that the chunked nature of `dask` `DataArray` objects is preserved during the update process. The issue seems to stem from the handling of `DataArray` objects within the `dataset_update_method`, particularly when merging datasets or other mappings into the existing dataset. The provided code does not explicitly address the preservation of chunked `dask` arrays, which could lead to their evaluation.

To address this, a potential patch could involve adding logic to check for `dask` arrays and ensure their chunking information is preserved during the update. However, without altering the core functionality and logic of the `dataset_update_method`, it's challenging to provide a precise patch without a deeper understanding of all potential side effects. 

That said, a hypothetical patch might look like this, focusing on preserving chunking by explicitly handling `dask` arrays during the merge process:

# modification 1
```python
<file>xarray/core/merge.py</file>
<original>return merge_core(
        [dataset, other],
        priority_arg=1,
        indexes=indexes,
        combine_attrs="override",
    )</original>
<patched>from dask.array.core import Array as DaskArray

def preserve_dask_chunks(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, DataArray) and isinstance(obj.data, DaskArray):
        return obj.chunk(obj.data.chunksize)
    else:
        return obj

if not isinstance(other, Dataset):
    other = {k: preserve_dask_chunks(v) for k, v in other.items()}

return merge_core(
    [dataset, other],
    priority_arg=1,
    indexes=indexes,
    combine_attrs="override",
)</patched>
```

This modification introduces a function `preserve_dask_chunks` that checks if an object is a `DataArray` with a `dask` array as its data. If so, it ensures that the `DataArray` is returned with its chunking preserved. This function is then used to preprocess the `other` mapping before it is merged with the existing dataset. 

Please note, this patch is hypothetical and focuses on the concept of preserving chunking. The actual implementation may require adjustments based on the broader context of `xarray`'s design and how it handles `dask` arrays throughout the library. Testing and validation would be crucial to ensure that this patch does not introduce unintended side effects, especially in terms of performance and compatibility with other `xarray` functionalities.
