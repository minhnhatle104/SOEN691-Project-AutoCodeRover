Given the constraints and the feedback indicating that the previous patches did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, it's clear that a different approach or clarification is needed. However, based on the scenario provided and the limitations in place, it's challenging to propose a new, actionable patch without further insights into the specific test failures or additional context regarding the pytest framework's internal handling of module-level skips and version-specific syntax.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing Test Failures**: Understanding exactly which tests failed and why. This would provide crucial insights into what aspect of the patch did not work as expected.
2. **Engaging with the Community**: If possible, discussing the issue and proposed solutions with the pytest development community could uncover additional insights or alternative approaches.
3. **Iterative Testing**: Developing a series of smaller, more focused patches and testing them in isolation to identify which changes produce the desired outcome without introducing test failures.

Without the ability to perform these steps or access more detailed feedback within this format, I'm unable to provide further patches. In a real development environment, this iterative process, combined with direct feedback from test results and potentially from other developers or users, would guide the creation of a successful patch.

For educational purposes, the ideal next step would be to analyze the test failures in detail to understand why the proposed changes did not resolve the issue as expected.
