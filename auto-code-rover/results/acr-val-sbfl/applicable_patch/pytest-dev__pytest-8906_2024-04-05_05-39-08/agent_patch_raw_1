<original>    .. note::
        It is better to use the :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref` marker when
        possible to declare a test to be skipped under certain conditions
        like mismatching platforms or dependencies.
        Similarly, use the ``# doctest: +SKIP`` directive (see `doctest.SKIP
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/how-to/doctest.html#doctest.SKIP>`_)
        to skip a doctest statically.</original>

        It is better to use the :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref` marker when

        like mismatching platforms or dependencies. However, for skipping tests
        at the module level due to version-specific syntax or other module-level
        requirements, you can use `skip` with `allow_module_level=True`.

These modifications aim to clarify the documentation and error messages related to skipping tests, especially at the module level, to address the issue raised. The first modification updates the note in the `skip` function documentation to explicitly mention its use with `allow_module_level=True` for module-level skipping. The second modification updates the error message to provide clearer guidance on how to use `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` for skipping modules, which is particularly useful when dealing with version-specific syntax or other module-level requirements.
