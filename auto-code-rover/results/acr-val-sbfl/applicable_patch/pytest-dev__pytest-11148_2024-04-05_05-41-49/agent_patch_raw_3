Given the constraints and the feedback that the proposed patches do not directly apply to the existing codebase, and without specific details on the implementation of `pmxbot.logging` and the tests that are failing, I'll provide a conceptual approach to address the issue. This approach will focus on general best practices for resolving common problems related to module imports and class instantiation in Python, which you can adapt to your specific situation.

### Conceptual Approach to Resolving Import Issues

The issue at hand involves the `pmxbot.logging` module being imported twice, leading to inconsistencies with the `Logger` class. This situation can arise from a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the project's structure, the way imports are handled, and the configuration of the testing environment.

#### Ensuring Singleton Behavior for `Logger`

If the `Logger` class is intended to act as a singleton, but Python's import mechanism is creating multiple instances due to the module being loaded more than once under different names or paths, consider implementing a more robust singleton pattern or using a module-level instance.

**Conceptual Patch**:
```python
# In pmxbot/logging.py or wherever Logger is defined

class Logger:
    pass  # Existing implementation

# Replace direct instantiation with a module-level instance
logger_instance = Logger()
```

Then, in other parts of the application, import and use `logger_instance` directly instead of creating new `Logger` instances.

#### Standardizing Imports

Inconsistent imports can lead to modules being loaded multiple times. Ensure that all imports of `pmxbot.logging` are consistent across the project. Decide on either `import pmxbot.logging as logging` or `from pmxbot import logging` and stick with it throughout the codebase.

**Conceptual Guidance**:
- Review all files for inconsistent import statements.
- Choose a consistent import style and apply it throughout the project.

#### Debugging Import Issues

To diagnose and resolve issues with modules being loaded more than once, leverage Python's built-in facilities to inspect the import system.

**Conceptual Steps**:
1. Use `importlib.util.find_spec('pmxbot.logging')` at various points in your code to inspect how the `pmxbot.logging` module is being located by the import system.
2. Before running tests, set the environment variable `PYTHONVERBOSE` to `1` (or higher for more detailed output) to get insights into how modules are being imported.

#### Review Test Configuration

Issues that manifest during testing but not in regular execution often point to differences in the testing environment.

**Conceptual Guidance**:
- Review your test runner configuration and any setup code in your test suite for modifications to the import system or `sys.path`.
- Ensure that test isolation mechanisms (e.g., mocking or patching) are not inadvertently affecting how modules are imported or resolved.

### Applying the Conceptual Approach

Since the specific patches provided earlier could not be directly applied, use the conceptual approach outlined here as a guideline to review and refactor your code and configuration. The goal is to identify and resolve the root causes of the import inconsistencies and singleton behavior of the `Logger` class, adapting the guidance to fit the specifics of your project's structure and setup.
