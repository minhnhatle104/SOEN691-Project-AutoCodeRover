Given the information from the issue description and the external analysis tool, it's clear that modifications are likely needed in the `GoogleDocstring` class, specifically in methods related to parsing and formatting parameters.\n\nLet's start by examining the relevant methods in the `GoogleDocstring` class to understand their current implementation and how they interact with the `napoleon_use_param` configuration. This will help us identify where changes are needed to ensure the \"Other Parameters\" section is formatted according to the `napoleon_use_param` setting.\n\nI will use the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"GoogleDocstring\", \"_parse_other_parameters_section\")` - This will help us understand how the \"Other Parameters\" section is currently being parsed.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"GoogleDocstring\", \"_parse_parameters_section\")` - This will provide context on how the \"Parameters\" section is parsed and how it differs from the \"Other Parameters\" section.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"GoogleDocstring\", \"_format_docutils_params\")` - Since the issue suggests using this method for both sections when `napoleon_use_param` is True, we need to understand its current implementation.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"GoogleDocstring\", \"_format_fields\")` - This method is used in the current implementation for the \"Other Parameters\" section, so we need to understand its behavior.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how parameter sections are currently handled and point towards the necessary modifications."
