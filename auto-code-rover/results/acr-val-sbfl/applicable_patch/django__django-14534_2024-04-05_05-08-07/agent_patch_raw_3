Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the approach to resolving the issue. Since the direct modification attempts have not resolved the issue as expected, let's reconsider the approach based on the original description and the feedback provided. 

However, based on the information and constraints provided, it's clear that a direct and straightforward solution might not be feasible without additional context or re-evaluation of the issue at hand. The original patch was designed to address the problem as described, by ensuring that the `id` attribute, if specified in the widget's attributes, is used by the `BoundWidget.id_for_label` method. 

Given the limitations and the feedback that the proposed patches did not resolve the issue, and without further specific details on the test failures or additional context from the project, it's challenging to provide an alternative patch that guarantees to address the issue without potentially introducing other problems.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the test cases that failed to understand why the proposed solution did not work as expected.
- Consulting with other developers or contributors to the project for insights or overlooked aspects of the implementation.
- Considering if there are other dependencies or related parts of the code that might be affecting the behavior of the `id_for_label` method in ways not accounted for in the initial analysis.

Without the ability to perform these actions or receive more detailed feedback, providing another patch attempt would likely not be productive. It's crucial to have a clear understanding of why the initial patch did not pass the tests to make an informed adjustment.
