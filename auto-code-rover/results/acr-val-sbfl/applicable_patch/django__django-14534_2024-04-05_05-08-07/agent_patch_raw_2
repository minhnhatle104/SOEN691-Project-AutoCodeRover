Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more accurately, let's revise the approach to ensure that the `id_for_label` method correctly utilizes the `id` attribute from the widget's attributes if it is explicitly set. This revision will consider potential nuances in how the `id` attribute is managed and ensure compatibility with existing functionalities.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/boundfield.py</file>
<original>    def id_for_label(self):
        return 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])
</original>
<patched>    def id_for_label(self):
        # Check if 'id' is explicitly set in the widget's attributes and use it if available.
        if 'id' in self.data['attrs']:
            return self.data['attrs']['id']
        else:
            return 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])
</patched>
```

This modification explicitly checks for the presence of the `id` attribute in `self.data['attrs']` before deciding which `id` value to return. If the `id` attribute is present, it uses this value directly, ensuring that the explicitly set `id` is respected. If not present, it falls back to the original behavior of constructing the `id` based on the widget's name and index. This approach aims to maintain backward compatibility while addressing the issue described.
