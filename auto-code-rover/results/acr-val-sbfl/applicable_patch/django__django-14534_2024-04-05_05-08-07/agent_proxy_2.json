To ensure accuracy in identifying the exact location of the bug based on the provided context and the issue description, let's clarify and correct the identification:\n\n- **Buggy File and Method**:\n  1. **File**: `django/forms/boundfield.py`\n     - **Class**: `BoundWidget`\n     - **Method**: `id_for_label`\n\nThis method in the `BoundWidget` class is directly mentioned in the issue description as not properly using the `id` set by `ChoiceWidget.options`, which is crucial for rendering the label of widgets like `CheckboxSelectMultiple` correctly. The method currently constructs an ID using the widget's name and index, ignoring the `id` attribute that might have been explicitly set, leading to the described issue.\n\nNo further context is needed at this point, as the issue description, along with the search results, provides sufficient information to identify the location and nature of the bug accurately."
