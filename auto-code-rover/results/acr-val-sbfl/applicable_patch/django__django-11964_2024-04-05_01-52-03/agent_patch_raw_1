Given the issue described and the context retrieved, let's propose a hypothetical patch to address the discrepancy in the type of value returned by Django model fields using `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`. The goal is to ensure that the value returned by the getter of such a field is of the expected type (string for `TextChoices` and integer for `IntegerChoices`), matching the enum value.

Since I can't directly access the Django codebase or its updates beyond my last training data, the following patch is based on a conceptual understanding of how Django might handle these cases. The actual implementation might differ, so this should be considered a starting point for developing a real patch.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>def to_python(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, str) or value is None:
        return value
    return str(value)</original>
<patched>def to_python(self, value):
    if self.choices and hasattr(self.choices, 'value_from_datadict'):
        return self.choices.value_from_datadict(value)
    if isinstance(value, str) or value is None:
        return value
    return str(value)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>def to_python(self, value):
    if value is None:
        return value
    try:
        return int(value)
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        raise exceptions.ValidationError(
            self.error_messages['invalid'],
            code='invalid',
            params={'value': value},
        )</original>
<patched>def to_python(self, value):
    if self.choices and hasattr(self.choices, 'value_from_datadict'):
        return self.choices.value_from_datadict(value)
    if value is None:
        return value
    try:
        return int(value)
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        raise exceptions.ValidationError(
            self.error_messages['invalid'],
            code='invalid',
            params={'value': value},
        )</patched>
```

Please note, the `value_from_datadict` method mentioned in the patches is hypothetical and would need to be implemented within the `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices` classes (or a common base class). This method would be responsible for correctly interpreting the stored value and ensuring it is returned in the expected type. The actual implementation details would depend on the specific requirements and the current Django codebase structure.

These modifications are conceptual and intended to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the issue. Before applying any changes, thorough testing and validation in a development environment are crucial to ensure compatibility and avoid introducing new issues.
