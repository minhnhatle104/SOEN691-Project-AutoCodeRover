Given the constraints and the nature of the issue with Django's `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`, let's consider a different approach for the patch. The issue seems to revolve around the type of the value returned by the getter of a field not matching the expected type when using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`. A more direct approach might involve ensuring that the field's getter method correctly interprets and returns the enum's value in the expected format.

Since the initial attempt did not resolve the issue, let's focus on a hypothetical modification that ensures the model field correctly handles the enum values upon retrieval. This solution will involve adjusting how the model field retrieves and processes the value, ensuring it matches the expected type.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>def from_db_value(self, value, expression, connection):
    return value</original>
<patched>def from_db_value(self, value, expression, connection):
    if self.choices is not None:
        if isinstance(self.choices, models.TextChoices) or isinstance(self.choices, models.IntegerChoices):
            return self.choices(value).value
    return value</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>def get_prep_value(self, value):
    return super().get_prep_value(value)</original>
<patched>def get_prep_value(self, value):
    if self.choices is not None:
        if isinstance(self.choices, models.TextChoices) or isinstance(self.choices, models.IntegerChoices):
            # Ensure the value is an instance of the correct Enum before preparing it for the database.
            if not isinstance(value, (self.choices,)):
                value = self.choices(value).value
    return super().get_prep_value(value)</patched>
```

This approach attempts to directly address the issue by ensuring that when a value is retrieved from the database (`from_db_value`) or prepared for the database (`get_prep_value`), it is correctly processed as per the `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices` definition. This ensures that the value is always in the expected format, whether it's being read from or written to the database.

Please note, these patches are conceptual and based on a simplified understanding of the Django ORM's internals. The actual implementation might require a more nuanced approach, considering Django's extensive support for custom field types, database backends, and other advanced features. Before applying any changes, it's crucial to review the Django documentation, consult with the Django community, and thoroughly test the modifications in a development environment to ensure they address the issue without introducing new problems.
