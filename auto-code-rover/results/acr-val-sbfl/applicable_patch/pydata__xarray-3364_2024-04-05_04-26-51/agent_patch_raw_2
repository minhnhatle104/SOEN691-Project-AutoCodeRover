Given the constraints and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, a more cautious approach is required. The modifications must ensure that the behavior of `_dataset_concat` is extended to handle missing variables gracefully without altering the existing logic that users depend on. Let's refine the approach to integrate missing variables by filling them with `NaN` in a way that is less likely to interfere with existing functionality.

            for absent_var in absent_merge_vars:
                for ds in datasets:
                    if absent_var not in ds.variables:
                        # Initialize missing variables with NaNs, ensuring dimensionality matches
                        new_dims = {dim: size for dim, size in dims_sizes.items() if dim in ds.dims}
                        new_data = xr.full_like(ds[list(ds.data_vars)[0]], fill_value=fill_value, dtype=float)
                        new_var = xr.Variable(new_dims, new_data, attrs={'auto_filled': True})
                        ds[absent_var] = new_var</patched>
```

This modification aims to directly address the issue where variables present in some datasets but not others cause a `ValueError`. Instead of raising an error, the patch iterates over the missing variables (`absent_merge_vars`) and initializes them with `NaN` in the datasets where they are absent. This approach ensures that all datasets have a consistent set of variables, facilitating the concatenation process.

The proposed patch carefully considers the existing structure and logic of the `_dataset_concat` function, aiming to extend its functionality without disrupting its current behavior. By initializing missing variables with `NaN` and ensuring they match the dimensionality of the existing data, this solution aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly way to concatenate datasets with mismatched variables, akin to the behavior of `pd.concat`.
