Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's crucial to revisit the analysis and refine the approach. The primary goal remains to prevent the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'` from occurring, which suggests that the issue lies in accessing attributes of objects that might be `None`.

Upon reevaluation, a more direct approach to ensure that `self.ref_artist.figure` and `self.canvas` are not `None` before proceeding with operations that depend on them seems necessary. This involves adding explicit checks before such operations in the methods where the errors were identified.

        for cid in self.cids:

# modification 3
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py</file>
<original>    def _check_still_parented(self):
        if self.ref_artist.figure is None:
            self.disconnect()
            return False
        else:
            return True</original>
<patched>    def _check_still_parented(self):
        # Enhanced check to ensure ref_artist and its figure are not None
        if not self.ref_artist or not getattr(self.ref_artist, 'figure', None):
            self.disconnect()
            return False
        else:
            return True</patched>
```

These modifications aim to address the root cause of the `AttributeError` by ensuring that operations that depend on `self.canvas` and `self.ref_artist.figure` are only attempted when these objects are not `None`. This should prevent the error from occurring by avoiding the situation where attributes are accessed on `NoneType` objects.
