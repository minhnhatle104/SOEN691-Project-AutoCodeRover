Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to ensure compatibility and correct functionality. It appears the initial attempt might have overlooked some aspects of integrating the asynchronous response handling properly within the Django ASGI framework. Let's refine the patch with a more detailed and corrected implementation.

        # (the one thing super() doesn't do is __call__, apparently)

</patched>
```

In the revised patch, I've made sure to properly convert the synchronous `serve` method into an asynchronous call within `get_response_async` by using `sync_to_async`. This ensures that the Django's static file serving can operate in an asynchronous context as expected by ASGI applications
