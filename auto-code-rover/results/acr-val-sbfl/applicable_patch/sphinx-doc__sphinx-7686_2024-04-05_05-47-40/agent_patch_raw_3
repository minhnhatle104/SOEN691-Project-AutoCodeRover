Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial attempt did not resolve the issue, let's consider a different approach. The problem seems to be with the handling of the `imported_members` flag and its effect on the inclusion of imported members in the generated documentation. A closer examination of the logic in `generate_autosummary_content` suggests that the filtering based on the `imported_members` flag might not be correctly applied.

Given the complexity of the issue and without specific details on the test failures, a hypothetical but more cautious approach would involve ensuring that the `imported_members` flag is correctly used to filter out imported members. This requires a careful adjustment in the logic that determines whether a member is considered imported or not.

Since the direct modification did not yield the expected results, and without further specific feedback, a precise new patch cannot be provided. However, a general direction for a solution would involve revisiting the logic in `generate_autosummary_content`, particularly around how members are filtered based on their origin module.

A conceptual patch might look like this, focusing on ensuring that the comparison between the member's module and the current object's module is correctly handled:

# Conceptual modification (Hypothetical Patch)
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py</file>
<original>if imported or getattr(value, '__module__', None) == getattr(obj, '__module__', None):</original>
<patched># This is a conceptual patch and might not directly apply
if not imported_members:
    # Only include members that are defined in the same module as `obj`
    if getattr(value, '__module__', None) != getattr(obj, '__module__', None):
        continue</patched>
```

This conceptual patch is intended to clarify the logic: it explicitly continues to the next iteration of the loop if `imported_members` is `False` and the member's module does not match the current object's module. This approach aims to ensure that when `imported_members` is `False`, only members that are defined within the module being documented are included.

Please note, this is a hypothetical solution aimed at illustrating a potential direction for resolving the issue based on the provided context. Actual implementation may require adjustments based on the specific architecture of Sphinx, the detailed behavior of its documentation generation process, and the results of testing this change against the full test suite.
