However, to precisely identify the bug and propose a solution, we would benefit from a closer look at the implementation details of the document generation process, especially how imported members are handled. Therefore, the following search API calls would be useful:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"generate_autosummary_docs\", \"sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py\")`: This will provide insight into how documentation is generated and how the `imported_members` parameter influences the process.\n\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"imported_members\", \"sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py\")`: This will help us understand where and how the `imported_members` variable is used within the document generation logic, which is crucial for resolving the issue.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\nBased on the analysis of the provided context and the issue description, the bug locations are likely in:\n\n1. **Buggy File:** `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`\n   - **Buggy Method:** `generate_autosummary_docs`\n     - This method is directly involved in generating the autosummary documentation. Since the issue is related to the inclusion of imported members in the generated documentation, the logic within this method that handles the `imported_members` parameter is a likely location of the bug.\n\n2. **Buggy File:** `sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py`\n   - **Buggy Method:** `process_generate_options`\n     - This function is responsible for processing the autosummary generation options, including the handling of `autosummary_imported_members`. Any incorrect handling or passing of this configuration could contribute to the issue.\n\nThese locations are the most probable places where the logic for filtering imported members based on the `autosummary_imported_members` setting might not be working as expected, leading to the described bug."
