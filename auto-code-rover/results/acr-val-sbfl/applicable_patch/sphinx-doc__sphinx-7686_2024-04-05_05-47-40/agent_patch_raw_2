Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, it's clear that the approach needs to be reconsidered. The original intention was to ensure that the `imported_members` flag correctly influences whether imported members are included in the generated documentation. The issue seems to be with how members are determined to be imported or not. 

Upon further reflection, the logic within `generate_autosummary_content` for filtering members based on whether they are imported needs a more nuanced approach. Specifically, the check should ensure that a member is included only if it is defined in the current module (when `imported_members` is `False`). The previous patch attempted to address this, but it appears the comparison was not correctly formulated or did not account for all scenarios.

Given this, a more accurate approach would involve ensuring that the comparison correctly identifies members defined in the module being documented, as opposed to those imported from other modules. However, without additional specific feedback on why the tests failed or further details on the exact nature of the failures, crafting a precise patch is challenging.

A hypothetical correction might involve a more detailed inspection of the member's origin, but without specific details on the test failures or additional context on how members are handled elsewhere in Sphinx, proposing a new patch is speculative. 

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. Reviewing the test failures to understand which scenarios the patch did not account for.
2. Inspecting how Sphinx determines the origin of a member elsewhere in its codebase, to ensure consistency with those mechanisms.
3. Possibly revisiting the documentation and user reports related to `autosummary_imported_members` to gather more insights into expected behaviors in edge cases.

Given the constraints of this interaction, I cannot provide a revised patch without additional specific feedback or more detailed insights into the cause of the test failures. In practice, resolving such issues often requires iterative debugging and testing, informed by a detailed understanding of both the specific failures and the broader system's architecture.
