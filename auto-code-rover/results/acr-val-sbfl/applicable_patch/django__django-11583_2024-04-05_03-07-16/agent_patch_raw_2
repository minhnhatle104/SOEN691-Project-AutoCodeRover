Given the feedback and the need to address the issue without introducing potential side effects that could cause tests to fail, a more conservative approach is warranted. The initial attempt aimed to sanitize file paths, which might have been too aggressive or incompatible with certain expectations elsewhere in the codebase. 

Considering the nature of the "ValueError: embedded null byte" error and the context in which it occurs, a more targeted approach could involve adding specific checks for null bytes in file paths and logging an error or warning when such paths are encountered. This would avoid altering the paths directly, which could lead to unintended consequences, and instead provide visibility into when and where problematic paths are detected.

        # This is thrown when the file does not exist.

```

This revised patch focuses on detecting and logging paths that contain null bytes without attempting to modify or sanitize them. This approach should preserve the integrity of the file paths while providing insights into the occurrence of paths that might lead to the "ValueError: embedded null byte" error. By logging detailed information about the problematic paths, developers can investigate the specific circumstances under which these paths are generated or encountered, facilitating a more targeted diagnosis and resolution of the underlying issue. 

This solution assumes that logging the occurrence of null bytes in paths will not interfere with the normal operation of the application or the execution of tests, beyond providing additional diagnostic information.
