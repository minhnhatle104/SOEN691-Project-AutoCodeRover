Given the context and the issue described, the patch aims to address the intermittent "ValueError: embedded null byte" error encountered during the auto-reloading process with `StatReloader`. The error likely stems from handling file paths that, under certain conditions, may contain or be interpreted to contain null bytes. Since the direct cause and reproduction steps are unclear, a cautious approach is to enhance error handling around file path operations, particularly in the `snapshot_files` method where file paths are processed.

This patch introduces a sanitization step for file paths to remove any null bytes before attempting to access the file's metadata (`stat`). Additionally, it adds error handling for `ValueError`, which is the specific exception type mentioned in the issue. This approach aims to prevent the error from occurring by ensuring that file paths are in a valid format before they are processed further. It also logs errors related to file path processing, which could help in diagnosing the issue further if it persists or reoccurs. 

Note: This patch assumes that the `file` variable is an instance of `pathlib.Path` or a similar object that supports the `as_posix` method and can be reconstructed with a sanitized path string. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the exact type of `file` and the project's specific path handling implementation.
