            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to gather more context about the methods and code snippets mentioned in the issue description and the external analysis tool's output. Here are the API calls I would like to make:\n\n1. To understand how the session is being decoded and where the crash might be happening due to incorrect padding or a bad signature, I will look into the `_get_session` method in the `SessionBase` class, as it's directly mentioned in the traceback and flagged by the external tool.\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem with decoding session data and specifically points out an `Incorrect padding` error, it would be useful to examine the `decode` method in the `SessionBase` class, if it exists, or in the relevant file to see how session data is being handled.\n\n3. The external tool also flagged the `_set_session_key` method in the `SessionBase` class. This might be related to how session keys are managed, which could potentially lead to issues with session data handling. I'll investigate this method to see if there's a connection.\n\n4. Given the `AttributeError` related to `_session_cache`, it's important to understand how and where `_session_cache` is being accessed or modified. This might give insights into why the attribute might be missing or not set correctly.\n\n5. The issue description includes a specific error message related to `django.core.signing.BadSignature`. It would be beneficial to look into how signatures are verified within the Django framework, particularly in the context of session data.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls I would make:\n\n- search_method_in_class(method_name=\"_get_session\", class_name=\"SessionBase\")\n- search_method_in_class(method_name=\"decode\", class_name=\"SessionBase\")\n- search_method_in_class(method_name=\"_set_session_key\", class_name=\"SessionBase\")\n- search_code_in_file(code_str=\"_session_cache\", file_path=\"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")\n- search_code(code_str=\"django.core.signing.BadSignature\")"
