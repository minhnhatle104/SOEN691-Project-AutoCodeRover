Given the feedback and the need to address the issue with a more accurate approach, let's revise the patch considering the structure and logic of the `nthroot_mod` function. The goal is to ensure that when \(a \mod p = 0\), the function correctly identifies \(0\) as a root, alongside any other roots if `all_roots` is set to `True`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py</file>
<original>if not is_nthpow_residue(a, n, p):
        return None
    if not isprime(p):
        raise NotImplementedError("Not implemented for composite p")</original>
<patched>if a % p == 0:
        # If a is 0 mod p, then 0 is always a root. We need to check if it should be the only root.
        if not all_roots:
            return 0
        else:
            # If looking for all roots, 0 should be included in the list of roots.
            # However, other roots should also be calculated and included if they exist.
            roots = [0]
            # Proceed with the calculation to find other roots, if any, and append to the list.
    if not is_nthpow_residue(a, n, p) and a % p != 0:
        return None
    if not isprime(p):
        raise NotImplementedError("Not implemented for composite p")</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the special case when \(a \mod p = 0\) is handled correctly at the beginning of the function. It checks if \(a\) is \(0\) modulo \(p\) and handles the return value based on the `all_roots` flag. If `all_roots` is `False`, it immediately returns \(0\) as the root. If `all_roots` is `True`, it initializes a list of roots with \(0\) and then proceeds with the rest of the function to find any additional roots, which will be appended to the list if they exist. This approach ensures that \(0\) is correctly identified as a root in all scenarios while maintaining the function's ability to find other roots when required.
