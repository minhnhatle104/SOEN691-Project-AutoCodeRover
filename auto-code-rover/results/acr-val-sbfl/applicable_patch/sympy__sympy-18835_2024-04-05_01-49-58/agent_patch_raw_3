Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the initial approach to modifying the `uniq` function may not directly address the issue described. The core of the problem lies in the function's behavior when the input sequence is being modified during iteration, which is not adequately handled by simply checking for changes in the sequence's length. 

Considering this, a more appropriate solution would involve ensuring that the function operates on a static snapshot of the sequence at the time of the function call, thereby preventing any runtime modifications from affecting the iteration process. This approach would sidestep the issue entirely by avoiding iteration over a changing sequence.

This modification ensures that `uniq` operates on a static snapshot of the input sequence (`seq_snapshot`), which is created at the beginning of the function. This approach prevents the iteration from being affected by any modifications to the original sequence (`seq`) during the iteration process, addressing the issue described.
