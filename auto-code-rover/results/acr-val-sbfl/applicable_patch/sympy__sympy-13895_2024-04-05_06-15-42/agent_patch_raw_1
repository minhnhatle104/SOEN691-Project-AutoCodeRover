Given the complexity of the issue and the specific details provided, a precise patch cannot be provided without a deeper understanding of the entire SymPy library's architecture and the intended behavior of the `_eval_power` method for all possible inputs. However, based on the information provided and the nature of the issue, I can suggest a conceptual patch that aims to address the potential problem of handling expressions raised to a symbolic power, especially when the base is a combination of rational numbers and variables.

The issue seems to arise from the simplification of expressions involving powers, where the base is a combination of a variable term and a rational number, and the exponent is the variable itself. The observed behavior suggests that the simplification process might not correctly handle the complex number component resulting from raising a negative base to a fractional power.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/mul.py</file>
<original>        if e.is_Rational or e.is_Float:
            return p._eval_expand_power_base()</original>
<patched>        if e.is_Rational or e.is_Float:
            # Check if base is negative and exponent is not an integer
            if b.could_extract_minus_sign() and not e.is_Integer:
                return p
            return p._eval_expand_power_base()</patched>
```

This modification adds a check before attempting to expand the power base. If the base could potentially be negative (which can be checked with `could_extract_minus_sign()`) and the exponent is not an integer (which means the result could involve complex numbers), the method returns the power without further expansion. This aims to prevent incorrect simplification that might lead to losing the imaginary part of the result.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might not cover all edge cases or might introduce new issues. It's crucial to thoroughly test this change with a wide range of expressions to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality and correctly addresses the issue at hand. Additional adjustments might be necessary based on a deeper understanding of the library and more extensive testing.
