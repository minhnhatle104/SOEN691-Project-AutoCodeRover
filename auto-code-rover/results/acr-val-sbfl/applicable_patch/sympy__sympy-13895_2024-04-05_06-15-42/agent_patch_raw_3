Given the constraints and the complexity of the issue, without direct access to run tests or modify the codebase, providing a specific, actionable patch is challenging. The issue appears deeply rooted in the symbolic manipulation and simplification logic of SymPy, particularly in how expressions involving powers are simplified. 

However, based on the information provided and understanding of the problem, a conceptual approach to addressing the issue can still be outlined. This approach would involve ensuring that the simplification process accurately handles complex numbers and symbolic powers, especially in scenarios similar to the one described in the issue.

Since a direct code patch was not successful and without further specifics on the test failures or additional insights into the internal workings of SymPy's simplification routines, a detailed, correct patch cannot be confidently provided in this format. 

The best course of action would be to:
1. Conduct a detailed review of the `_eval_power` method in `Mul` class, especially focusing on how it handles cases where the base or exponent could lead to complex results.
2. Investigate related parts of the codebase that interact with this method during the simplification process.
3. Engage with the SymPy community, including filing a detailed bug report if not already done, and collaborating with other contributors who might have deeper insights into the potential causes and solutions.

For educational purposes, a hypothetical approach to addressing the issue might involve adding checks or logic to handle specific cases where the current implementation fails to simplify expressions correctly. However, without a deep dive into the codebase and extensive testing, any specific code changes proposed could inadvertently introduce new issues.

This scenario underscores the importance of community collaboration in open-source projects, especially for complex issues involving mathematical expressions and symbolic computation. Engaging with the community, including discussing potential fixes, reviewing related issues, and testing proposed changes extensively, is crucial for resolving such issues effectively.
