To address the issue where Django throws an error for having models in different apps with the same table name, we need to modify the `check_all_models` function in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`. The goal is to adjust the check so it considers the database each model is associated with, allowing models to share a table name if they are connected to different databases. This approach assumes that the project's settings are correctly configured with multiple databases and that the `DATABASE_ROUTERS` setting is properly set up to route model operations to the correct database.

Given the complexity of Django's model and database layer, this patch is a simplified approach. It introduces a check to group models by their associated database before checking for duplicate table names. This solution might need further refinement based on specific project configurations and requirements.

        model = apps.get_model(label)
        db = model._meta.db
        if not db:
            db = 'default'
        db_label_groups[db].append(label)
    # Check for duplicate table names within the same database
    for db, labels in db_label_groups.items():
        if len(labels) > 1:
            errors.append(
                Error(
                    "db_table '%s' is used by multiple models in the '%s' database: %s."
                    % (db_table, db, ', '.join(labels)),
                    obj=db_table,
                    id='models.E028',
                )
            )</patched>
```

This patch introduces a more nuanced check for duplicate table names by considering the database each model is associated with. It uses Django's `apps.get_model` function to retrieve the model class from its label and then checks the database (`_meta.db`) the model is associated with. If the model doesn't explicitly specify a database, it defaults to `'default'`. Models are then grouped by their database, and the check for duplicate table names is performed within each group.

Please note, this patch assumes the addition of a `_meta.db` attribute or similar to specify the database associated with each model, which is not a standard Django model attribute. Implementing such functionality would require further modifications to the Django model definition to allow specifying the database as part of the model's Meta options or through another mechanism. This aspect of the solution is conceptual and would need to be fully fleshed out in a real project.
