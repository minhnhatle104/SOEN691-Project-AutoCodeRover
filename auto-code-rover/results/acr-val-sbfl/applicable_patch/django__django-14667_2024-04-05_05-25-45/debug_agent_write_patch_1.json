If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we can derive insights into how Django's ORM handles deferred and immediate loading of fields, which is central to the issue at hand. Here's a breakdown of the relevant methods and their implications:\n\n### `add_deferred_loading` in `Query`\nThis method adds field names to a set of fields that should be excluded from loading when automatic column selection is performed. If the `defer` flag is true, it adds the given field names to the existing deferred names. Otherwise, it removes the names from the set of any existing \"immediate load\" names. This mechanism is crucial for understanding how deferred fields are managed, especially in the context of chaining `.defer()` and `.only()` methods.\n\n### `add_immediate_loading` in `Query`\nThis method is responsible for specifying which fields should be retrieved immediately when the SQL is executed. It replaces any existing immediate loading field names and respects existing deferrals. This method ensures that immediate loading overrides existing immediate values but respects deferrals, which is essential for the issue where `.only()` does not seem to respect subsequent `.defer()` calls correctly.\n\n### `deferred_to_data` in `Query`\nThis method converts the `deferred_loading` data structure to an alternate structure, describing the fields that will be loaded. It's used to compute the columns to select from the database and helps the `QuerySet` class determine which fields are being initialized on each model. Understanding this method is key to diagnosing why the expected fields are not being deferred as intended.\n\n### `__getitem__` in `QuerySet`\nThis method retrieves an item or slice from the set of results. It's less directly related to the issue but provides insight into how querysets handle item retrieval, which could affect how deferred and immediate loading work in practice, especially when slicing or indexing querysets.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how `.defer()` and `.only()` methods interact within the `Query` class, particularly in how deferred and immediate loading sets are managed. The expected behavior, where chaining `.defer()` after `.only()` should result in only the non-deferred fields being loaded, does not occur. Instead, all fields are loaded, indicating a potential oversight in how these sets are merged or overridden in the `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods.\n\nTo address the issue, a patch may need to ensure that when `.defer()` is called after `.only()`, the fields specified in `.only()` are correctly marked for immediate loading, and any subsequent `.defer()` calls correctly modify this set, rather than the current behavior where all fields end up being loaded regardless of the `.defer()` calls. This might involve adjusting the logic in `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` to better handle the interaction between deferred and immediate loading fields."
