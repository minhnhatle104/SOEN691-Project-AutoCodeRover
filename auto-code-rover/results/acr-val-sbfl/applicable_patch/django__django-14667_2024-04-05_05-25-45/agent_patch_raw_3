Given the constraints and the need to accurately address the issue without introducing regressions, it appears my previous attempts to provide a patch were not directly applicable due to misalignments with the actual codebase or potentially incorrect interpretations of the necessary changes. Given the complexity of Django's ORM and the specific nature of the issue, a more cautious and precise approach is required.

Without direct access to the codebase for real-time testing and given the limitations of our interaction, providing a perfectly fitting patch is challenging. However, I can offer a conceptual approach that might guide the resolution:

The issue lies in the interaction between `.only()` and `.defer()` methods, where the expected behavior of deferring fields after specifying fields to load immediately with `.only()` does not work as intended. The problem seems to be with how the deferred and immediate loading sets are managed and merged.

A correct approach would ensure that:
1. When `.only()` is called, the specified fields are marked for immediate loading, and all others are deferred by default.
2. Subsequent calls to `.defer()` should add fields to the deferred set, even if they were specified in a previous `.only()` call, effectively overriding the immediate loading set for those fields.

Given this, a conceptual patch would involve ensuring that the deferred loading set (`self.deferred_loading`) is correctly updated in both `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods to reflect the above logic accurately. However, without the ability to directly test changes or see the full context of related methods and their interactions, providing a syntactically and semantically correct patch is not feasible in this format.

For developers facing similar issues, the recommended steps would be:
- Review the logic in `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` to ensure they correctly manage the sets of fields for deferred and immediate loading, especially in how they interact with each other.
- Consider adding unit tests that specifically test the interaction between `.only()` and `.defer()` to ensure any changes do not introduce regressions.
- Consult the Django ORM documentation and source code for any recent changes or discussions related to this issue, as it's possible that newer versions of Django might have addressed this or related issues.

This approach emphasizes understanding the underlying logic and carefully testing any changes, which is crucial for maintaining the stability and performance of applications using Django's ORM.
