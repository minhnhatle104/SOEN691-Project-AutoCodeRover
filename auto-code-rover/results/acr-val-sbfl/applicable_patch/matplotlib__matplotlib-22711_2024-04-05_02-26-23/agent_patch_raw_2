Given the feedback and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, a revised approach is necessary. The original problem stems from an `IndexError` due to an attempt to access an index that is out of bounds for the `xy` array. This suggests that the `xy` array does not need an additional point at index 4 for proper functionality. The correct approach might involve ensuring that the `xy` array's size is correctly managed and that the polygon is properly defined without requiring an index that exceeds its current bounds.

            xy[1] = val[0], .75

This modification removes the line that directly caused the `IndexError` by attempting to access an out-of-bounds index (`xy[4]`). The assumption here is that the polygon defined by `xy` does not require an explicit closure by repeating the starting point at the end of the array, as the drawing mechanism should automatically close the shape. This change aims to resolve the initialization issue without introducing errors in other parts of the system.
