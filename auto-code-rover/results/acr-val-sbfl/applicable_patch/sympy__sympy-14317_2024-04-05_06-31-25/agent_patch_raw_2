Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, a more feasible approach would be to ensure that the LaTeX printer respects the global ordering settings applied to polynomials. Since directly sorting expressions within the `_print_Poly` method might not be straightforward without an existing method like `.sort(order='lex')`, a better approach would involve leveraging any existing global settings or mechanisms within SymPy that dictate the order of polynomial terms.

However, without a clear mechanism to directly influence the order at the point of LaTeX conversion and in the absence of a specific method to sort expressions within the `_print_Poly` function, we are limited in our ability to craft a precise patch. The core issue seems to be with how the polynomial's terms are ordered or interpreted when converting to a LaTeX string, which might require a deeper integration with SymPy's polynomial handling and ordering mechanisms.

A more accurate approach, albeit speculative without further investigation into SymPy's internals, would involve ensuring that the polynomial is represented in a consistent order before it's passed to the LaTeX printer. This might involve adjustments at a higher level where the polynomial's expression is generated or where the printing settings are applied.

Given these considerations, a speculative and conceptual patch might look like this, focusing on ensuring that the polynomial is represented in the desired order by adjusting how `poly.as_expr()` is called:

```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>    def _print_Poly(self, poly):
        cls = poly.__class__.__name__
        expr = self._print(poly.as_expr())
        gens = list(map(self._print, poly.gens))
        domain = "domain=%s" % self._print(poly.get_domain())

        args = ", ".join([expr] + gens + [domain])
        if cls in accepted_latex_functions:
            tex = r"\%s {\left (%s \right )}" % (cls, args)
        else:
            tex = r"\operatorname{%s}{\left( %s \right)}" % (cls, args)

        return tex
</original>
<patched>    def _print_Poly(self, poly):
        cls = poly.__class__.__name__
        # Adjusting to ensure the expression respects the global order settings
        expr = self._print(poly.as_expr(order='grlex'))
        gens = list(map(self._print, poly.gens))
        domain = "domain=%s" % self._print(poly.get_domain())

        args = ", ".join([expr] + gens + [domain])
        if cls in accepted_latex_functions:
            tex = r"\%s {\left (%s \right )}" % (cls, args)
        else:
            tex = r"\operatorname{%s}{\left( %s \right)}" % (cls, args)

        return tex
</patched>
```

Note: The `order='grlex'` parameter in `poly.as_expr(order='grlex')` is used here as an example to illustrate the concept of applying an order. The actual implementation would depend on the correct handling of order within `as_expr()` and might require ensuring that `as_expr()` supports and correctly interprets such an order parameter, which may not currently be the case. This patch is conceptual and aims to highlight the direction for a solution rather than provide a directly implementable fix.
