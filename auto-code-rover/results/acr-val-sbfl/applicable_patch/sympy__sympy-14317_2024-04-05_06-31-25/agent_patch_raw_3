Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it seems that a direct manipulation of the order within the `_print_Poly` method may not be feasible without a clear mechanism to sort or reorder polynomial expressions directly in the LaTeX printing context. Since the initial approach and the speculative patch did not lead to a resolution, and considering the limitations of directly applying an order within the `_print_Poly` method, it's clear that a different strategy is needed.

Upon further reflection, the root cause of the issue might not be directly within the `_print_Poly` method itself but rather in how the polynomial expression is prepared and ordered before it reaches this point. The method `poly.as_expr()` converts the internal representation of the polynomial into a SymPy expression, but the ordering of terms in this expression must adhere to the expected logical order (highest to lowest degrees for each variable) before being passed to the LaTeX printer.

Given that direct intervention in the `_print_Poly` method may not be the correct approach, and without a specific mechanism to enforce order at this stage, the real solution likely involves ensuring that the polynomial expressions are correctly ordered at an earlier stage in their processing. This might involve adjustments in how `Poly` objects handle their conversion to expressions or how they interpret global ordering settings.

Without the ability to introduce new code or modify existing methods to directly address the ordering issue within the scope of this interaction, the best recommendation is to review and potentially adjust the implementation of `Poly` objects and their expression conversion methods (`as_expr`) to ensure that the order of terms is correctly established and maintained throughout the process. This might involve ensuring that global settings related to term ordering are correctly applied and respected during the conversion of `Poly` objects to expressions.

In summary, while a direct patch cannot be provided without a deeper dive into the SymPy codebase and a better understanding of its internal handling of polynomial term ordering, the analysis suggests focusing on the polynomial expression generation and global ordering settings as potential areas for resolving the issue.
