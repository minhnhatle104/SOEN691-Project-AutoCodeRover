```

This patch ensures that `n_neighbors` is always treated as an integer within the `kneighbors` method of the `KNeighborsMixin` class. If `n_neighbors` is not an integer and cannot be converted to one, a `TypeError` is raised with a clear message. This approach addresses the issue without changing the method's signature or behavior for valid inputs, ensuring backward compatibility.
