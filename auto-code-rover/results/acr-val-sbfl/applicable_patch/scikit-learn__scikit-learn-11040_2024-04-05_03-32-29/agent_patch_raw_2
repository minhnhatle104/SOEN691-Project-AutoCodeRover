Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to ensure that the validation of `n_neighbors` as an integer is both comprehensive and compatible with the expected behavior of the `kneighbors` method. We'll adjust the patch to perform the validation earlier and in a way that's less likely to interfere with any existing logic that might expect `n_neighbors` to be already validated or set.

        n_neighbors = int(n_neighbors)
    elif not isinstance(n_neighbors, numbers.Integral):
        raise ValueError("n_neighbors must be an integer or a float convertible to an integer; got type {}".format(type(n_neighbors).__name__))

if X is not None:
    query_is_train = False
    X = check_array(X, accept_sparse='csr')
else:
    query_is_train = True
    X = self._fit_X
    # Include an extra neighbor to account for the sample itself being

    n_neighbors += 1
</patched>
```

This revised patch includes a more thorough validation step for `n_neighbors`. It checks if `n_neighbors` is a real number and not an integral, then attempts to convert it to an integer. This approach allows floating-point numbers that are effectively integers (e.g., 3.0) while still raising a `ValueError` for non-numeric types or numeric types that cannot be cleanly converted to integers. This should ensure that `n_neighbors` is always an integer by the time it's used, addressing the issue without causing unintended side effects in the method's logic.
