Given the issue description, it's clear that we need to focus on the printing functionality for derivatives and floats within the Mathematica code printer. The suggested fixes imply modifications or additions to methods responsible for printing derivatives (`_print_Derivative`) and floats (`_print_Float`). Since these methods are likely part of a specific printer class for Mathematica code, we should start by locating this class and the mentioned methods within it.\n\nLet's proceed with the following search API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the class that likely handles Mathematica code printing. Since the issue mentions \"MCodePrinter\", we'll start by searching for this class to confirm its existence and get its details.\n   \n   `search_class(\"MCodePrinter\")`\n\n2. Next, we need to verify if the methods `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` already exist in the \"MCodePrinter\" class or if they need to be added as part of the fix. This will help us understand the current implementation and how to integrate the proposed changes.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Derivative\", \"MCodePrinter\")`\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Float\", \"MCodePrinter\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a solid foundation for understanding how the Mathematica code printer is implemented and how it currently handles derivatives and floats. With this information, we can then proceed to draft the necessary patches."
