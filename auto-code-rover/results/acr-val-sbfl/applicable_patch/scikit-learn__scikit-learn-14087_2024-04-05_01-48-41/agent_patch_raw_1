Explanation:
The patch addresses the `IndexError` by ensuring that the indexing into `coefs_paths` does not exceed its dimensions. This is done by adding a condition in the list comprehension for both the 'ovr' and other cases to check if `best_indices[i]` is within the bounds of `coefs_paths`'s second dimension (for 'ovr') or third dimension (for other cases). This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when `refit=False` by ensuring that the indices used to access `coefs_paths` are valid.
