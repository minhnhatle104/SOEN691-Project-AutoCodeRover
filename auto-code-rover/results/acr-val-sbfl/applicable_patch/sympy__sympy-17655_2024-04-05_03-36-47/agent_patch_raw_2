Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach to directly manipulate the operands within the `__add__` method might not have been fully compatible with all use cases or there might have been an oversight in the handling of different types of operations involving `Point` objects. Let's refine the approach by focusing on enhancing the compatibility of `Point` objects with operations involving SymPy's symbolic expressions, without making assumptions about the structure of the `other` operand in the `__add__` method. This approach aims to improve the robustness of the method and ensure it works across a broader range of scenarios.

```

This revised patch attempts to handle the multiplication (`Mul`) involving a `Point` object more gracefully by leveraging SymPy's ability to distribute and expand expressions. This approach aims to decompose complex expressions into simpler terms that can be added individually to the `Point` object. If the distribution and expansion process fails or does not result in an additive expression (`is_Add`), the method falls back to the original behavior, thus maintaining the original functionality for cases not covered by this patch.
