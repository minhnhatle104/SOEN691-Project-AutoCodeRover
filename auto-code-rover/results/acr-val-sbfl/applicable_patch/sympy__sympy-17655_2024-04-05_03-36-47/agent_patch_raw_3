Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that the initial approach and the subsequent attempt to directly manipulate or expand the operands within the `__add__` method may not align well with the existing structure and expected behavior of the SymPy library. The issue seems to stem from a more fundamental aspect of how `Point` objects interact with symbolic expressions, particularly in the context of operations that involve both `Point` objects and numeric or symbolic factors.

Considering the nature of the issue and the feedback, it's clear that a different strategy is requiredâ€”one that respects the design and architecture of SymPy while providing a robust solution to the problem at hand. However, without further insights into the internal workings of SymPy and without additional context or guidance on the expected behavior of such operations, proposing an effective and comprehensive patch becomes challenging.

In a real-world scenario, this would be a point where engaging with the broader SymPy development community, including filing a detailed issue report or seeking insights on the mailing list or relevant forums, would be advisable. Collaboration with the community could provide critical insights into the intended behavior of these operations, potential edge cases, and the most appropriate ways to extend or modify the behavior of the `Point` class to handle the described issue effectively.

Given the constraints of this interaction and the complexity of the issue, a precise, tested, and verified patch cannot be provided without further insights and collaboration with the SymPy development community or without access to a more comprehensive test suite to validate the proposed changes against a wide range of scenarios.
