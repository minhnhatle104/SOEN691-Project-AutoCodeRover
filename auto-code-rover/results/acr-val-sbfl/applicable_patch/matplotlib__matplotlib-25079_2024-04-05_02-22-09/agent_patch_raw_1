Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem arises when the normalization (`norm`) of a `ScalarMappable` object is updated after a colorbar has been created, but the colorbar does not reflect these changes. A potential solution is to ensure that any update to the `norm` also triggers an update to any associated colorbar to reflect the new normalization settings. This solution assumes that the colorbar is not automatically updated when the `norm` of its associated `ScalarMappable` is changed.

This modification ensures that when the normalization (`norm`) of a `ScalarMappable` object is updated via the `set_norm` method, any associated colorbar is also updated to reflect the new normalization settings. The `update_normal` method on the colorbar should be responsible for redrawing or recalculating the colorbar based on the new normalization. This method might need to be implemented or ensured to handle such updates correctly within the colorbar's implementation.

Please note, this patch assumes that the colorbar object has or will have an `update_normal` method that correctly handles the updating process based on the new `norm`. If such a method does not exist, it would need to be implemented in the colorbar class, taking into account how to efficiently update and redraw the colorbar based on a new normalization setting.
