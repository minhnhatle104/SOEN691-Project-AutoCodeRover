Given the constraints and the failure of the initial approach, it seems we need a more nuanced solution that directly addresses the core issue without relying on hypothetical methods. The core problem appears to be that the colorbar does not reflect updates to the `norm` after it has been created. A more robust solution might involve ensuring that any update to the `norm` triggers a re-evaluation of the color mapping and a redraw of the associated plots and colorbars.

A potential oversight in the initial patch was not directly addressing how the `ScalarMappable`'s change in normalization should propagate to the colorbar. Since the colorbar is tightly coupled with the `ScalarMappable` object (through its `mappable` attribute), we should ensure that changes in the `ScalarMappable`'s state are reflected in the colorbar. This can be achieved by invoking the `changed()` method of `ScalarMappable`, which is designed to notify all listeners (including colorbars) that the mappable has changed.

```

This modification leverages the existing `changed()` method in the `ScalarMappable` class. The `changed()` method is intended to notify all listeners (including any associated colorbars) that the mappable's state has changed, prompting them to update accordingly. By calling `self.changed()` at the end of the `set_norm` method, we ensure that any change to the normalization triggers a re-evaluation of the color mapping and a redraw of the associated colorbar, reflecting the new normalization settings accurately.

This approach does not assume the existence of additional methods on the colorbar and relies on the existing infrastructure designed to handle updates to the `ScalarMappable` state. It should be a more reliable solution to the issue described.
