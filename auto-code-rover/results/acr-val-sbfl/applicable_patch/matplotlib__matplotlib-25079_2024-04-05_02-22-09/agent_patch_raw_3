Given the constraints and the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue, it's clear that a different approach is needed. The problem seems to be deeply rooted in the interaction between the `ScalarMappable` object and its normalization (`norm`) update mechanism, especially in how these updates are reflected in the associated colorbar. Since direct modifications to the `set_norm` method and attempts to trigger updates through the `changed` method have not been successful, we need to reconsider the underlying mechanism.

Upon further reflection, it's possible that the issue might not be directly within the `ScalarMappable`'s methods but rather in how the `norm` update is propagated and how the colorbar responds to these updates. Since the provided context does not indicate a straightforward solution and previous attempts based on the given information have failed, we are at a point where speculative patches may not lead to a resolution without additional specific insights into the failure modes of the tests or a deeper understanding of the internal workings and interactions of the matplotlib codebase related to this issue.

Without the ability to directly inspect the codebase further or run diagnostic tests to pinpoint the exact failure points, any additional patches would be speculative at best. The issue likely involves complex interactions between the colorbar, the `ScalarMappable` object, and possibly other components of matplotlib that are not fully captured in the provided context.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the test cases that failed to understand the specific conditions under which the issue occurs.
- Debugging the matplotlib codebase with a focus on the interactions between `ScalarMappable`, its `norm`, and the colorbar, especially looking for any changes between the versions where the issue was introduced.
- Consulting the matplotlib development documentation or community for insights into changes made in version 3.6.3 that could affect colorbar behavior and normalization updates.

Given the limitations of this format, I recommend these approaches for further investigation by the project maintainers or contributors with access to the full codebase and testing framework.
