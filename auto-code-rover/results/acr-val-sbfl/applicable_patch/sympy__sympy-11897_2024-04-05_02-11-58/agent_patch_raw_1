Given the context and the issue described, it seems the inconsistency between the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer is not due to a specific bug in the code but rather a difference in how these printers are designed to represent mathematical expressions. The LaTeX printer uses LaTeX syntax which can represent mathematical expressions in a compact and precise manner, suitable for publication and further processing by LaTeX tools. On the other hand, the pretty printer aims to display expressions in a way that is readable in plain text environments, such as terminals or simple text editors, where LaTeX syntax cannot be rendered.

To address the issue, a direct patch to the existing code may not be appropriate as it involves fundamental differences in the output formats of the two printers. However, enhancing documentation or providing guidelines on how to interpret the differences between the two printers could be beneficial for users. Below is a hypothetical patch to the documentation of the `pretty_print` function, explaining the difference in output compared to the LaTeX printer.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>
def pretty_print(expr, **settings):
    """Prints expr in pretty form.

    pprint is just a shortcut for this function.


    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : expression
        the expression to print
    wrap_line : bool, optional
        line wrapping enabled/disabled, defaults to True
    num_columns : int or None, optional
        number of columns before line breaking (default to None which reads
        the terminal width), useful when using SymPy without terminal.
    use_unicode : bool or None, optional
        use unicode characters, such as the Greek letter pi instead of
        the string pi.
    full_prec : bool or string, optional
        use full precision. Default to "auto"
    order : bool or string, optional
        set to 'none' for long expressions if slow; default is None
    use_unicode_sqrt_char : bool, optional
        use compact single-character square root symbol (when unambiguous);
        default is True.

    """
    print(pretty(expr, **settings))
</original>
<patched>
def pretty_print(expr, **settings):
    """Prints expr in pretty form.

    pprint is just a shortcut for this function.

    Note: The output of pretty_print may differ from the LaTeX printer output
    due to the inherent differences in the target formats. The LaTeX printer
    produces expressions ready for rendering with LaTeX, which allows for
    a more compact and mathematically precise representation. In contrast,
    pretty_print aims to make expressions readable in plain text environments,
    prioritizing clarity and readability over compactness.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : expression
        the expression to print
    wrap_line : bool, optional
        line wrapping enabled/disabled, defaults to True
    num_columns : int or None, optional
        number of columns before line breaking (default to None which reads
        the terminal width), useful when using SymPy without terminal.
    use_unicode : bool or None, optional
        use unicode characters, such as the Greek letter pi instead of
        the string pi.
    full_prec : bool or string, optional
        use full precision. Default to "auto"
    order : bool or string, optional
        set to 'none' for long expressions if slow; default is None
    use_unicode_sqrt_char : bool, optional
        use compact single-character square root symbol (when unambiguous);
        default is True.

This modification aims to clarify the intended use and output differences between the `pretty_print` and LaTeX printers, rather than altering the functionality of the code. It's important to communicate these differences to users to set the right expectations and help them choose the appropriate printer for their needs.
