Given the nature of the issue, which is about the inconsistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers in SymPy, and considering that a documentation update alone wouldn't resolve the functional discrepancy, let's approach this with a hypothetical patch aimed at aligning the behavior of the LaTeX printer with that of the pretty printer for specific cases mentioned in the issue. 

The issue points out differences in how fractions and expressions involving functions like `exp` and `log` are printed. To address this, we could introduce additional settings or modify the behavior of the LaTeX printer to more closely match the pretty printer's output where desired. 

However, it's important to note that fundamentally changing the LaTeX printer's behavior to match the pretty printer might not be desirable in all cases, as the LaTeX format allows for more mathematically precise representation. Instead, introducing an optional setting that users can enable to make the LaTeX output more closely resemble the pretty printer's output could be a more flexible solution.

Below is a hypothetical patch that introduces such a setting to the LaTeX printer for handling fractions in a way that's more aligned with the pretty printer's output. This patch is illustrative and may not directly apply to the actual SymPy codebase without further adaptation.

<patched>
def _print_Mul(self, expr):
    ...
    # Check if the new setting 'match_pretty_printer' is enabled
    if self._settings.get('match_pretty_printer', False):
        # Simplified handling of fractions to match pretty printer's output
        if denom is not S.One:
            numer_tex = convert(numer)
            denom_tex = convert(denom)
            tex += r"\\frac{%s}{%s}" % (numer_tex, denom_tex)
        else:
            tex += convert(expr)
    else:
        if denom is S.One:
            tex += convert(expr)
        else:
            ...
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a conditional check for a new setting `match_pretty_printer` within the `_print_Mul` method of the `LatexPrinter` class. When this setting is enabled, the method uses a simplified approach for printing fractions, aiming to make the LaTeX output more similar to what the pretty printer produces. 

Please note, this patch is hypothetical and serves as an example of how one might begin to address the issue. Actual implementation may require a more comprehensive approach, including introducing the new setting in a way that it's accessible and documented for users, and possibly applying similar changes to other parts of the LaTeX printer to address the full scope of the reported issue.
