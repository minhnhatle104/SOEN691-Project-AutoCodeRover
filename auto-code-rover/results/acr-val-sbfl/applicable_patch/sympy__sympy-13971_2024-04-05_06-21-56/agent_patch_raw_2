Given the feedback and the necessity to maintain compatibility with LaTeX while also ensuring proper rendering in Markdown, a more nuanced approach is required. The issue with the original patch was that it directly replaced the LaTeX-specific bracketing with plain text brackets, which might not be suitable for all LaTeX environments. A revised patch should ideally introduce a conditional rendering mechanism or a way to specify the output format, but without such context, a straightforward improvement would be to correct the LaTeX syntax for sequences in a way that doesn't conflict with Markdown rendering.

                s.coeff(stop - 1), s.coeff(stop))
        elif s.stop is S.Infinity or s.length > 4:

        else:
            printset = tuple(s)

        # Adjusted to use \left[ and \right] without backslashes for the brackets themselves,
        # which should be more compatible with different rendering targets including Markdown.
        # This approach maintains LaTeX syntax while avoiding the specific issue with backslash escaping.
        return (r"\left["  # Removed the backslash before the opening bracket
              + r", ".join(self._print(el) for el in printset)
              + r"\right]")  # Removed the backslash before the closing bracket
</patched>
```

This revised patch maintains the use of `\left` and `\right` to allow for dynamic sizing of the brackets in LaTeX, which is a desirable feature for mathematical expressions. However, it removes the incorrect backslash escaping of the brackets themselves, which was the source of the rendering issue in Markdown. This change aims to preserve the intended functionality in LaTeX while improving compatibility with Markdown rendering.
