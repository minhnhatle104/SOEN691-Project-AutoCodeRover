Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to ensure that the header rows are correctly integrated into the output while maintaining the integrity of the `RST` format. The initial attempt might have overlooked the specific formatting requirements of reStructuredText tables. Let's adjust the implementation to correctly format the header rows according to the `RST` specifications.

# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/rst.py</file>
<original>    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(delimiter_pad=None, bookend=False)</original>
<patched>    def __init__(self, header_rows=None):
        super().__init__(delimiter_pad=None, bookend=False)
        self.header_rows = header_rows</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>astropy/io/ascii/rst.py</file>
<original>    def write(self, lines):
        lines = super().write(lines)
        lines = [lines[1]] + lines + [lines[1]]
        return lines</original>
<patched>    def write(self, lines):
        # Process header rows if provided
        if self.header_rows:
            # Assuming self.header_rows is a list of tuples/lists [(header1, header2, ...), (unit1, unit2, ...)]
            header, units = self.header_rows
            header_line = ' '.join(header)
            unit_line = ' '.join(units)
            # Adding a separator line based on the header lengths
            separator_line = ' '.join(['=' * len(h) for h in header])
            # Prepend the header information
            lines = [header_line, unit_line, separator_line] + lines
        lines = super().write(lines)
        # Adjust the output to include the separator line both at the top and bottom of the table
        lines = [lines[2]] + lines + [lines[2]]
        return lines</patched>
```

**Explanation**:
- **Modification 1** remains the same, allowing the `RST` class to accept `header_rows` during initialization.

- **Modification 2** has been revised to ensure that the header rows are formatted according to the `RST` table format requirements. Specifically:
  - The header and unit rows are processed to create separate lines for headers and units, with spaces between each column's header/unit.
  - A separator line is generated based on the lengths of the headers, ensuring that it aligns correctly with the columns.
  - These lines are then correctly prepended to the table content, with the separator line also added at the top and bottom of the table to comply with `RST` formatting.

This revised approach should correctly integrate the header rows into the `RST` output while adhering to the format's specifications, addressing the issue without causing test failures.
