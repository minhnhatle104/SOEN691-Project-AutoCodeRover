**Explanation**:
- **Modification 1**: Updates the `__init__` method of the `RST` class to accept an optional `header_rows` argument. This argument is then stored as an instance variable. This change allows the `RST` writer to be initialized with header rows information, addressing the issue where it previously could not accept this argument.
  
- **Modification 2**: Modifies the `write` method to prepend the `header_rows` to the lines if `header_rows` is provided. This ensures that when writing the table, the header rows are included at the top of the table. The original method is preserved for cases where `header_rows` is not provided, ensuring backward compatibility.

These modifications collectively enable the `RST` output format to support header rows, enhancing its flexibility for use in autogenerated documentation and other applications requiring structured table outputs with headers.
