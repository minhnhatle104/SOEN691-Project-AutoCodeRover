    from sympy import Identity
    syms = expr.atoms(Symbol)
    for term in syms:
        # Check if the symbol is an Identity matrix and handle it appropriately
        if term == Identity:
            namespace.update({str(term): 'np.eye'})
        else:
            namespace.update({str(term): term})</patched>
```

**Explanation**: The patch addresses the issue where the symbol `I` is misinterpreted as a complex number instead of an identity matrix. By checking if the symbol represents an identity matrix (`Identity`), we can map it to the NumPy function `np.eye` which generates identity matrices. This ensures that when `lambdify` encounters an identity matrix, it correctly translates it into a numerical function that generates an identity matrix, rather than misinterpreting it as the imaginary unit. Note that the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the correct way to identify and handle identity matrices within the broader context of the SymPy codebase.
