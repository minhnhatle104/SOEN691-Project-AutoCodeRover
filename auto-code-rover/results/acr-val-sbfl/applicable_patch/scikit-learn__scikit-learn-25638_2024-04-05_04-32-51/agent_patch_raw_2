Given the complexity of handling pandas nullable types within the scikit-learn framework and the initial attempt not resolving the issue, a more nuanced approach is required. The challenge lies in ensuring that the nullable pandas dtypes are correctly identified and handled without causing unintended side effects in the broader scikit-learn ecosystem. 

Given this, a revised approach would involve ensuring compatibility at the point of interaction with these types, specifically within the `unique_labels` function and potentially adjusting how types are inferred in `type_of_target`. However, without the ability to directly test and iterate within the actual codebase or detailed feedback on the specific tests that failed, crafting a precise patch is challenging. 

A hypothetical patch, focusing on enhancing compatibility with nullable pandas dtypes by refining type checks and handling, might look like this:

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>sklearn/utils/multiclass.py</file>
<original>if not issparse(y) and y.dtype == object and not isinstance(y.flat[0], str):
    # [obj_1] and not ["label_1"]
    return "unknown"</original>
<patched>import pandas as pd

# Enhanced handling for nullable pandas dtypes
if not issparse(y):
    if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(y) or pd.api.types.is_float_dtype(y) or pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype(y):
        # Handle pandas nullable types by inferring their logical type
        inferred_dtype = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(y, skipna=True)
        if inferred_dtype == "integer" or inferred_dtype == "floating":
            return "continuous"
        elif inferred_dtype == "boolean":
            return "binary"
    elif y.dtype == object and not isinstance(y.flat[0], str):
        # [obj_1] and not ["label_1"]
        return "unknown"</patched>
```

# modification 2 (Revised)
```python
<file>sklearn/utils/multiclass.py</file>
<original>if len(set(isinstance(label, str) for label in ys_labels)) > 1:
    raise ValueError("Mix of label input types (string and number)")</original>
<patched>import pandas as pd

# Adjust the check to consider pandas nullable types
if len(set(isinstance(label, str) for label in ys_labels)) > 1:
    if not all(isinstance(label, (str, int, np.integer)) or pd.isna(label) for label in ys_labels):
        raise ValueError("Mix of label input types (string and number)")</patched>
```

This revised approach takes into account the use of pandas API functions to better identify and handle nullable pandas dtypes. Specifically, it uses `pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype`, `is_float_dtype`, and `is_bool_dtype` to check for pandas nullable types, and `pd.api.types.infer_dtype` to infer the logical type of the data for more accurate classification in `type_of_target`. Additionally, it adjusts the handling of labels in `unique_labels` to account for the possibility of pandas NA values being present alongside other types.

It's important to note that without the ability to directly test these changes within the context of the scikit-learn codebase and the specific issue at hand, these patches are speculative and intended to illustrate a potential direction for resolving the issue. Further testing and iteration would be necessary to develop a fully functional and robust solution.
