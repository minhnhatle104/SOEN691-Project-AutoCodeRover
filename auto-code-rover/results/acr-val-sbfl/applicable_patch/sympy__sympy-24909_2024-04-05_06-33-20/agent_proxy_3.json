            "content": "Given the feedback, it appears that a more detailed investigation into the interaction between the `Prefix` and `Quantity` classes is necessary to pinpoint the exact location and nature of the bug. Since the initial analysis suggested that the issue lies in how these two classes interact, particularly with the multiplication operation, a closer look at the methods that facilitate this interaction is required.\n\nTo refine the search for the bug's location and obtain more precise information, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. **Examine the Implementation of Multiplication in `Prefix` and `Quantity`**: Since the issue arises when a `Prefix` is multiplied by a unit (like `W` for Watts), understanding the implementation of the `__mul__` method in both the `Prefix` and `Quantity` classes is crucial. This includes how these classes handle the multiplication operation internally and with each other.\n\n2. **Investigate How Units are Defined and Interact with Prefixes**: The `Quantity` class likely plays a key role in defining units and their interactions with prefixes. Understanding the properties and methods related to units and their scale factors could provide insights into where the bug might be.\n\nGiven this approach, the following search API calls are necessary to gather more context and accurately locate the bug:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__mul__\", \"Prefix\")`: To examine the multiplication implementation in the `Prefix` class.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__mul__\", \"Quantity\")`: To investigate the multiplication implementation in the `Quantity` class.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"def __mul__(self, other):\", \"sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\")`: To find the specific implementation of multiplication in the `Quantity` class, if it exists.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"def __mul__(self, other):\", \"sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py\")`: To locate the specific implementation of multiplication in the `Prefix` class.\n\nThese searches aim to provide a detailed view of how multiplication is handled within these classes, which is essential for identifying the bug's exact location and nature."
