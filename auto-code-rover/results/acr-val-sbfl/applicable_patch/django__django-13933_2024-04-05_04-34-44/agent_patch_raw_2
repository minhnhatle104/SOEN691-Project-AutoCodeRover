Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to ensure the patch correctly addresses the issue without causing test failures. The goal remains to modify the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the value of the invalid choice in the error message when a `ValidationError` is raised. 

It appears the initial attempt might have overlooked the correct way to format the error message or how the value is passed into the error message. Let's adjust the approach to ensure compatibility and correctness.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of'
                            ' the available choices.'),
</original>
<patched>'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of'
                            ' the available choices.'),
</patched>
```

# modification 2
Considering the feedback and aiming for a more precise fix, it's possible that the way the value is passed to the error message needs to be adjusted. The original patch attempted to directly interpolate the value into the error message, which might not align with Django's error handling mechanisms or the structure of `ValidationError`. Let's refine this approach.

```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice')</original>
<patched>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice', params={'value': value})</patched>
```

This revised approach ensures that the `params` argument is used when raising `ValidationError`, which is the correct way to pass additional context to error messages in Django. This method should ensure that the value of the invalid choice is correctly included in the error message without causing test failures.
