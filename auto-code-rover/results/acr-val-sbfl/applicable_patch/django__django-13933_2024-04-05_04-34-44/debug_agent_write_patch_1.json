Specifically, we want to ensure that the error message includes the value of the invalid choice, which is currently not happening according to the issue description. The external analysis tool has identified several suspicious methods, but the most relevant one for our issue seems to be in `django/forms/models.py` within the `ModelChoiceField` class. \n\nGiven this information, we should start by examining the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand how it handles validation and error messages. Additionally, looking into the `prepare_value` method might provide insights into how values are processed before validation occurs, which could be relevant to ensuring the invalid value is correctly included in the error message.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ModelChoiceField\")`: This will help us find the `ModelChoiceField` class in the codebase and understand its structure and current implementation.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"prepare_value\", \"ModelChoiceField\")`: Since the `prepare_value` method in the `ModelChoiceField` class is identified as suspicious, examining this method will provide insights into how values are prepared and potentially how we can modify it to include invalid values in error messages.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue and formulating a patch."

        "content": "Based on the collected context, we have the `ModelChoiceField` class within `django/forms/models.py`, which is a subclass of `ChoiceField`. This class is specifically designed to handle choices that are model QuerySets, making it suitable for forms that are tied to database models. The class definition provides insight into its structure, including the default error messages, initialization parameters, and several key methods.\n\nThe `default_error_messages` attribute of `ModelChoiceField` includes an 'invalid_choice' error message, which is generic and does not include the value of the invalid choice. This aligns with the issue description, indicating that when a validation error is raised for an invalid choice, the error message does not show the value of the invalid choice.\n\nThe `prepare_value` method is particularly relevant to our issue. This method is responsible for preparing the value before any validation occurs. It checks if the value has an attribute `_meta`, indicating it's a model instance, and then either returns the serializable value of the specified field (`to_field_name`) or the primary key of the model instance. If the value does not represent a model instance, it calls the superclass's `prepare_value` method.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from how the `ModelChoiceField` class handles validation and error messaging, particularly when an invalid choice is encountered. The current implementation does not include the invalid value in the error message, which could be due to how values are prepared and validated.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to modify the `validate` method to ensure that the invalid value is included in the error message. However, the `validate` method's implementation was not part of the provided context, so we may need to examine this method further. Additionally, we should consider if any changes are needed in the `prepare_value` method to better handle or log the value that is deemed invalid during validation.\n\nThe next steps could involve:\n1. Examining the `validate` method within the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand how validation is currently performed and how error messages are constructed.\n2. Determining how to modify the error message construction within the `validate` method to include the value of the invalid choice, possibly by enhancing the information passed to the `default_error_messages`.\n\nThis approach will ensure that when a `ValidationError` is raised for an invalid choice, the error message will include the specific invalid value, making it clearer to the end-user what the issue is."

        "content": "The `validate` method in the `ModelChoiceField` class, as found in `django/forms/models.py`, simply delegates the validation process to its superclass, `Field`, by calling `Field.validate(self, value)`. This means that the `ModelChoiceField` class does not implement any custom validation logic beyond what is provided by its superclass. \n\nGiven this information, the issue described\u2014where the `ModelChoiceField` does not show the value of the invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`\u2014is likely not directly related to the implementation of the `validate` method itself, since this method does not appear to handle the construction of error messages or specifically deal with invalid choices beyond the standard validation process.\n\nThe problem, therefore, seems to revolve around how the error messages are constructed and how the invalid choice's value is included (or not included) in those messages. Since the `validate` method in `ModelChoiceField` does not override or extend the superclass's validation logic to customize error messages, the solution might involve enhancing the error message handling elsewhere in the `ModelChoiceField` class or its superclass to ensure that the invalid choice value is captured and displayed in the error message.\n\nGiven the current context:\n- The `default_error_messages` in `ModelChoiceField` does not dynamically include the invalid value in the error message for an invalid choice. This is a static message and does not account for the specific invalid value that triggered the error.\n- The `validate` method delegates to the superclass and does not add any specific handling for invalid choices beyond what is already implemented in `Field`.\n\nTo address the issue, a potential approach could involve modifying how `ModelChoiceField` constructs its error messages to include dynamic content (i.e., the invalid value). This might not necessarily require changes to the `validate` method itself but could involve enhancing the mechanism by which error messages are generated and associated with validation errors, possibly by overriding or extending other methods or attributes related to error handling and message construction.\n\nIn summary, the bug location remains as previously identified, but the specific approach to resolving the issue will likely involve enhancing the error message handling rather than modifying the `validate` method:\n- Buggy file: `django/forms/models.py`\n- Class: `ModelChoiceField`\n- Area of focus: Error message handling, potentially involving attributes or methods related to error messages rather than the `validate` method itself."
