Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the approach to modifying the error handling within the `ModelChoiceField` class. Since direct modifications have led to test failures, it's important to reconsider the approach while ensuring compatibility with Django's existing validation and error messaging framework.

Upon further reflection, the initial patches attempted to directly modify the error message and the way `ValidationError` is raised without considering the full context of how Django's form field validation works. However, without the ability to directly test and receive immediate feedback within this environment, I'll provide a conceptual patch that should address the issue based on Django's documentation and standard practices.

Conceptually, the correct approach to include the invalid value in the error message while raising a `ValidationError` in Django involves ensuring that the error message template expects a placeholder for the dynamic value and that the value is correctly passed into the error message when the exception is raised. This often involves using the `params` dictionary to pass the value so that it can be included in the formatted message.

Given the limitations in executing and testing the patch directly, here's a revised conceptual approach that should be validated and tested within a Django development environment:

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice')</original>
<patched>raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice', params={'value': str(value)})</patched>
```

And ensure the error message template in `default_error_messages` is correctly set to interpolate the `value`:

```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of the available choices.'),</original>
<patched>'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the available choices.'),</patched>
```

This conceptual modification aims to correctly format the error message by ensuring the `params` argument is used when raising a `ValidationError`, which aligns with Django's mechanism for passing additional context to error messages. The `value` should be converted to a string to ensure it is correctly represented in the error message.

Please note, this conceptual patch is based on the understanding of Django's form and validation framework and should be carefully reviewed, tested, and adjusted as necessary in a development environment to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing test failures or other unintended consequences.
