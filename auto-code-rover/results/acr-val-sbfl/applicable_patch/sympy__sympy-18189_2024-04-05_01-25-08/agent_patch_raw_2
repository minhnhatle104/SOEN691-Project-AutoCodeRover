Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the issue, it seems the problem might not be solely with the handling of the `syms` parameter and its ordering. The issue might be more deeply rooted in how permutations are generated and applied based on the `permute` flag, especially considering that the problem manifests differently based on the order of symbols. 

Given this, a more appropriate approach might involve ensuring that the permutation logic correctly accounts for all possible permutations of the solutions, regardless of the order of symbols provided. However, without the ability to run tests or debug the code directly, I'll propose a conceptual patch aimed at ensuring the permutation logic is applied consistently and correctly for all symbol orders.

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>sympy/solvers/diophantine.py</file>
<original>if do_permute_signs:
                permuted_sign = set(permute_signs(sol))
                final_soln.update(permuted_sign)
            elif permute_few_signs:
                lst = list(permute_signs(sol))
                lst = list(filter(lambda x: x[0]*x[1] == sol[1]*sol[0], lst))
                permuted_sign = set(lst)
                final_soln.update(permuted_sign)
            elif do_permute_signs_var:
                permuted_sign_var = set(signed_permutations(sol))
                final_soln.update(permuted_sign_var)
            else:
                final_soln.add(sol)</original>
<patched># Ensure consistent application of permutations for all symbol orders
# Introduce a new function to handle permutation logic more robustly
def apply_permutations(solution_set, permute_signs, permute_signs_var, permute_few_signs):
    final_set = set()
    for sol in solution_set:
        if permute_signs:
            permuted_sign = set(permute_signs(sol))
            final_set.update(permuted_sign)
        elif permute_few_signs:
            lst = list(permute_signs(sol))
            lst = list(filter(lambda x: x[0]*x[1] == sol[1]*sol[0], lst))
            permuted_sign = set(lst)
            final_set.update(permuted_sign)
        elif permute_signs_var:
            permuted_sign_var = set(signed_permutations(sol))
            final_set.update(permuted_sign_var)
        else:
            final_set.add(sol)
    return final_set

# Apply the new function to handle permutations
final_soln = apply_permutations(sols, do_permute_signs, do_permute_signs_var, permute_few_signs)</patched>
```

Explanation:
This conceptual modification introduces a new function, `apply_permutations`, designed to encapsulate the permutation logic in a more robust and consistent manner. By centralizing this logic, we can ensure that permutations are applied uniformly across all solutions, regardless of the initial order of symbols. This approach aims to address the root cause of the issue by making the permutation logic more transparent and easier to debug and modify if necessary. 

Please note, this is a conceptual patch and might require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase correctly, including the correct handling of parameters and integration with the existing `diophantine` function logic.
