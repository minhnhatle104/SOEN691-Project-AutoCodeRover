            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the `diophantine` function and how permutation of symbols is handled within the codebase. Given the nature of the issue, it seems pertinent to look into the implementation of the `diophantine` function and any related permutation logic. Therefore, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"diophantine\")`: This will help us find where the `diophantine` function is defined and potentially give us insight into how it processes the `syms` parameter and the `permute` flag.\n2. `search_code(\"permute=True\")`: Since the issue is specifically related to the behavior when `permute=True` is set, searching for this code snippet might lead us to relevant parts of the code that handle permutation logic, which could be directly related to the bug."
