Given the constraints and the need to address the compatibility issue directly without introducing version checks, the patch can be simplified by directly replacing the use of `long` with `int`. This approach leverages the fact that in Python 2, `int` will automatically become `long` if it's too large, and in Python 3, `int` has no size limit, effectively behaving like `long` from Python 2. This change should resolve the compatibility issue without needing to check the Python version.

```python
<file>sympy/core/numbers.py</file>
<original>                num = list(num)
                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)
                _mpf_ = tuple(num)</original>
<patched>                num = list(num)
                num[1] = int(num[1], 16)  # Use int for Python 2 and 3 compatibility
                _mpf_ = tuple(num)</patched>
```

This patch corrects the issue by replacing `long(num[1], 16)` with `int(num[1], 16)`, ensuring that the code works in both Python 2 and Python 3 environments. This approach avoids runtime version checks and leverages Python's automatic type handling to maintain compatibility.
