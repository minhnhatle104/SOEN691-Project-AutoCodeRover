                # Ensure compatibility with Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 support
                num[1] = int(num[1], 16) if sys.version_info[0] >= 3 else long(num[1], 16)

```

This patch addresses the issue by checking the Python version at runtime and using the appropriate type for conversion (`int` for Python 3 and onwards, `long` for Python 2). This ensures that the code remains compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3 environments. Note that for this solution to work, you need to ensure that `sys` is imported at the top of the file:

```python
import sys
```
