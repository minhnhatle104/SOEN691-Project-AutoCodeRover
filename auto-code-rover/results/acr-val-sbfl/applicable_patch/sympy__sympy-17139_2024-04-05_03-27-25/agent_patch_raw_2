Given the feedback, it seems the initial approach to directly return the expression when encountering a complex exponent in the `TR6` function did not resolve the issue comprehensively. A more nuanced approach may be required, particularly focusing on handling the comparison operation that leads to the error. Since the error originates from an invalid comparison of complex numbers, we should ensure that such comparisons are avoided or handled correctly within the simplification process. Let's attempt a different approach that directly addresses the comparison issue.

    # Attempt to safely evaluate the exponent if it's a complex number

            rv = rv.base**exp_as_int

```

This revised patch attempts to handle cases where the exponent is a complex number by trying to convert the exponent to an integer using `as_int` with `strict=False`. This approach aims to simplify the exponent when possible, allowing the transformation to proceed without leading to invalid comparisons. If the conversion fails due to the complex nature of the exponent, the expression is passed through unchanged, avoiding the error. This approach is more targeted at the root cause of the issue, ensuring that operations leading to invalid comparisons are carefully handled or bypassed.
