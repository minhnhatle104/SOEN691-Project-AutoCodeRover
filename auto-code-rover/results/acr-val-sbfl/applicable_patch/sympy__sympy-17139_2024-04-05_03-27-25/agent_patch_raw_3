Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that handling the issue requires a different approach that doesn't directly modify the handling of complex numbers within the `TR6` function itself. Since the direct manipulation and conditional checks around complex numbers did not resolve the issue, we might need to reconsider the approach towards how expressions are simplified, especially focusing on avoiding invalid operations on complex numbers without altering the core logic of expression simplification.

Considering the nature of the issue, which involves an invalid comparison of complex numbers, and the fact that direct handling within the `TR6` function did not yield the desired outcome, a more appropriate solution might involve ensuring that comparisons involving complex numbers are handled more gracefully upstream or within utility functions that `TR6` relies on. However, without the ability to directly test and validate the impact of such changes within this environment, providing a specific patch becomes speculative.

Given the limitations and the feedback on the attempts made, the best course of action would be to re-evaluate the simplification process, especially how expressions involving complex numbers are treated during simplification and comparison operations. This might involve:

1. Reviewing and possibly enhancing the logic within utility functions that perform comparisons to ensure they gracefully handle complex numbers or expressions involving complex numbers.
2. Implementing additional checks or logic within the simplification process to identify and appropriately handle expressions that could lead to invalid comparisons before they occur.

Without the ability to directly interact with the codebase, run tests, or see the specific test failures, providing a more targeted patch is challenging. The issue seems to require a deeper understanding of the simplification process and possibly a broader set of changes than initially anticipated.
