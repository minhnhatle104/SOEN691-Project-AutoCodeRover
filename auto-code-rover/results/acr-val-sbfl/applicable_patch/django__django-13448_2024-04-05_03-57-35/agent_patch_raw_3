Given the constraints and the complexity of directly modifying Django's core behavior to address the issue, and considering the initial approach did not resolve the problem, it's clear that a straightforward patch may not be feasible without a deeper understanding of the specific project's context and without potentially introducing other issues.

The core issue arises from the fact that certain tables expected by Django or the project's tests do not exist when migrations are skipped (`"MIGRATE": False`). This situation is not typically accounted for in Django's standard testing framework, as the assumption is that either all migrations are run (creating all necessary tables) or the database is manually managed to ensure the required tables exist.

Given these considerations, a more appropriate solution might involve project-level adjustments rather than attempting to patch Django's core functionality. This could include:

1. **Creating a Custom Test Runner:** A custom test runner could check for the existence of necessary tables before tests are run and either warn the developer or attempt to create these tables. This approach keeps the core of Django untouched while providing flexibility for project-specific needs.

2. **Using Migrations Selectively:** Instead of disabling migrations entirely with `"MIGRATE": False`, consider using a selective approach where only the most time-consuming or unnecessary migrations are bypassed. This can be achieved by customizing the test database creation process to run specific migrations that ensure the database schema includes all necessary tables.

3. **Manual Database Setup for Testing:** In environments where test performance is critical, and migrations are a significant overhead, setting up a test database schema manually or through scripts that run before the test suite can ensure that all necessary tables and structures are in place. This approach allows for the most control over the test environment but requires additional maintenance.

Given the limitations of providing a direct patch to Django's core to solve this issue, these alternative approaches offer a way to work around the problem without risking unintended side effects or compatibility issues with future versions of Django.
