Explanation:
The patch modifies the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class to use a more sophisticated dimension comparison. Instead of directly comparing dimensions with `!=`, it uses the `equivalent_dims` method from the dimension system to check if two dimensions are equivalent, even if they are not identically represented. This approach allows for recognizing equivalent dimensions (e.g., `velocity` and `acceleration*time`) and avoids raising a `ValueError` when adding quantities with such dimensions. This change addresses the issue where the method incorrectly identified a dimension mismatch due to different representations of equivalent dimensions.
