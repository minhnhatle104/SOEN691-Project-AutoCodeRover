Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the previous attempts to directly modify the handling of skip location reporting in the presence of the `--runxfail` flag have not resolved the issue. Without the ability to test changes or see specific test failures, and based on the information provided, creating an effective patch is challenging. 

However, since direct modifications have not led to a successful resolution, and without further specific details on the test failures or additional context from the codebase, it's difficult to propose a new, accurate patch that addresses the issue without potentially introducing new problems.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing Test Failures**: Understanding exactly which tests failed and why. This would provide crucial insights into how the patch affected the behavior and potentially reveal what aspect of the patch did not work as expected.

2. **Debugging**: Running the tests locally or in a development environment with detailed logging to see how the skip locations are determined and reported in both standard and `--runxfail` scenarios.

3. **Consulting with the Team or Community**: Discussing the issue with other developers or the testing framework's community. Sometimes, issues like these can stem from deeper, more systemic problems within the framework, or there might be ongoing work or discussions related to the issue.

4. **Iterative Patching**: Based on the insights from debugging and discussions, iteratively updating the patch and testing until the issue is resolved.

Without the ability to perform these steps or access more detailed information, I'm unable to provide a further revised patch. In a practical setting, following the steps outlined above would be the recommended approach to finding a solution.
