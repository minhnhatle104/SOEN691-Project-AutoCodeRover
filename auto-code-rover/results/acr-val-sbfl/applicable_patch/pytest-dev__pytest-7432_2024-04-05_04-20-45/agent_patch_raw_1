This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the skip location is not modified when the `--runxfail` option is used. This is achieved by adding a condition to check if `--runxfail` is active (`not item.config.option.runxfail`) before modifying the skip location. This way, the original behavior of reporting the skip location as the location of the test item itself is preserved, while still respecting the intention behind the `--runxfail` option.
