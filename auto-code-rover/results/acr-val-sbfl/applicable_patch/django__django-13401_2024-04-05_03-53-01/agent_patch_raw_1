# modification 3
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file>
<original>    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.creation_counter)
</original>
<patched>    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.creation_counter, self.model))
</patched>
```

**Note**: In the patched versions, references to `self.model` assume that the `Field` class or its subclasses have a `model` attribute that references the model the field is attached to. If this attribute does not exist or is named differently, additional adjustments may be necessary to ensure that the model information is correctly used in comparisons and hash calculations.
