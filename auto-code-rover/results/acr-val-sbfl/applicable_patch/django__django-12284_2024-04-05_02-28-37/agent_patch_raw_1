This patch modifies the `_get_flatchoices` method in the `Field` class to include handling for inherited choices. If the field's `choices` attribute is `None`, it now attempts to find and use choices defined on the same field in any of the base classes (inherited models). This approach leverages the model's method resolution order (`__mro__`) to find inherited choices, ensuring that `flatchoices` reflects all available choices, including those added or overridden in child models.
