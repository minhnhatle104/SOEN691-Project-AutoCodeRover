Specifically, we should look into how the `__str__` or `__repr__` methods are implemented for the `DatasetGroupBy` class or its parent classes, as these methods are typically responsible for generating an object's string representation. Therefore, the following search API calls could provide the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")`\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"GroupBy\")`\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"GroupBy\")`\n\nThese searches aim to find the methods that might be directly responsible for the string representation of `DatasetGroupBy` objects, which could potentially reveal where the trailing whitespace is being introduced.\n\n- where are bug locations: \n\nCurrently, we do not have enough specific information to accurately pinpoint the bug locations. The analysis suggests that the issue is likely related to how the string representation of `DatasetGroupBy` objects is generated, but without further context on the implementation of their `__str__` or `__repr__` methods, we cannot specify buggy files and methods."
