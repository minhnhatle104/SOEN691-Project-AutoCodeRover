            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `DatasetGroupBy` text representation is generated. Since the issue specifically mentions the trailing whitespace in the text representation of `DatasetGroupBy`, we should start by looking into the methods that are likely responsible for generating this representation. Based on the external analysis tool's output, it seems that methods within `xarray/core/formatting.py` are suspicious. Given this, we should focus on methods that are likely to be involved in formatting or representing objects as strings.\n\nFirst, we need to check if there's a specific method responsible for generating the `DatasetGroupBy` representation. If no such specific method is found, we should then look into the methods flagged by the analysis tool, as they are involved in formatting and might contribute to the generation of the text representation of various objects, including `DatasetGroupBy`.\n\nLet's start by searching for a method that might directly relate to `DatasetGroupBy` representation:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")` - This will help us find the class and potentially any method responsible for its string representation.\n\nIf the direct search for `DatasetGroupBy` related methods does not yield useful results, we will proceed to examine the suspicious methods identified by the analysis tool:\n\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"_get_indexer_at_least_n_items\", \"xarray/core/formatting.py\")`\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"first_n_items\", \"xarray/core/formatting.py\")`\n4. `search_method_in_file(\"last_n_items\", \"xarray/core/formatting.py\")`\n5. `search_method_in_file(\"format_item\", \"xarray/core/formatting.py\")`\n6. `search_method_in_file(\"format_items\", \"xarray/core/formatting.py\")`\n\nThese searches will provide us with the necessary context to understand how the text representation is generated and where the trailing whitespace might be introduced."
