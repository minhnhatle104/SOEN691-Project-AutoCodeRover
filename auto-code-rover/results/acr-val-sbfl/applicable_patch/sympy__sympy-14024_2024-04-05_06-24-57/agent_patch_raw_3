Given the constraints and the complexity of the issue at hand, it's clear that crafting an effective patch requires a deep dive into the specifics of how SymPy handles expressions involving powers, particularly with negative bases and fractional exponents. Without the ability to directly test or interact with the SymPy codebase, and based on the information provided, it's challenging to propose a precise solution that would address the issue without unintended side effects.

The core of the problem seems to lie in the simplification process, especially in how expressions like \((-a)^x \cdot a^{-x}\) are simplified under different conditions (e.g., when \(a\) is a symbol with certain assumptions vs. when \(a\) is a concrete positive integer). The inconsistency between these cases suggests that the simplification rules or the logic that determines how and when these rules are applied might not fully account for the nuances of such expressions.

A proper fix would likely involve:

1. Identifying the specific part of the simplification logic that leads to the inconsistency.
2. Ensuring that the simplification process correctly handles expressions with negative bases and fractional exponents, taking into account the mathematical properties of such expressions and the assumptions about the variables involved.
3. Implementing additional checks or logic to handle cases that are currently simplified inconsistently, possibly by refining the conditions under which certain simplification rules are applied.

Given these considerations, and without the ability to propose a specific code change that could be confidently recommended as a solution, the best course of action would be to:

- Conduct a thorough review of the simplification logic related to powers and multiplication in SymPy, with a focus on identifying how expressions with negative bases and fractional exponents are handled.
- Develop a comprehensive set of test cases that cover a wide range of expressions involving powers with negative bases and fractional exponents, including cases where the base is a symbol with various assumptions and where the base is a concrete number.
- Use these test cases to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the current logic fails to simplify expressions consistently.
- Based on this analysis, implement targeted modifications to the simplification logic to ensure consistent handling of such expressions, ensuring that any changes are rigorously tested to prevent regressions.

This approach underscores the importance of a methodical and test-driven process in addressing complex issues in symbolic computation libraries like SymPy.
