I understand the need to revise the approach. Given the constraints and the need to ensure the patch addresses the issue correctly while passing all tests, let's refine the solution with a more careful consideration of the types and values `discrete_features` can take. The goal is to ensure compatibility with all valid inputs and maintain the integrity of the existing functionality. 

Given the initial attempt didn't resolve the issue as expected, I'll propose a new patch that aims to clarify the handling of `discrete_features` parameter more explicitly, ensuring that arrays, boolean values, and the string 'auto' are all correctly processed without introducing errors in future versions of numpy or breaking existing functionality.

# Revised Patch
```python
<file>sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py</file>
<original>if discrete_features == 'auto':
    discrete_features = issparse(X)

if isinstance(discrete_features, bool):
    discrete_mask = np.empty(n_features, dtype=bool)
    discrete_mask.fill(discrete_features)
else:
    discrete_features = np.asarray(discrete_features)
    if discrete_features.dtype != 'bool':
        discrete_mask = np.zeros(n_features, dtype=bool)
        discrete_mask[discrete_features] = True
    else:
        discrete_mask = discrete_features</original>
<patched>if discrete_features == 'auto':
    discrete_features = issparse(X)

# Convert discrete_features to a numpy array if it is not already one
if not isinstance(discrete_features, np.ndarray):
    discrete_features = np.asarray(discrete_features)

# Handle the case where discrete_features is a boolean
if discrete_features.dtype == bool:
    # If it's a single boolean, we expand it to apply to all features
    if discrete_features.shape == ():
        discrete_mask = np.full(n_features, fill_value=discrete_features, dtype=bool)
    else:
        # If it's an array of booleans, it should directly represent the mask
        discrete_mask = discrete_features
elif np.issubdtype(discrete_features.dtype, np.integer):
    # If discrete_features is an array of integers, treat these as indices of discrete features
    discrete_mask = np.zeros(n_features, dtype=bool)
    discrete_mask[discrete_features] = True
else:
    raise ValueError("discrete_features must be 'auto', a boolean, an array of booleans, or an array of integers.")</patched>
```

This revised patch aims to more robustly handle the various types that `discrete_features` can be, including a single boolean, an array of booleans, an array of integers, or the string 'auto'. It also adds a check to raise a ValueError if `discrete_features` is of an unexpected type, which should help prevent future errors and make the function's behavior more predictable and understandable.
