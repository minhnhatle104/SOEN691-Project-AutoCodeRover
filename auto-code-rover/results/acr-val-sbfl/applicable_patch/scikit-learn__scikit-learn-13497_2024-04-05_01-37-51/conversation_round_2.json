        "content": "Based on the issue description and the code snippet from the `_estimate_mi` method in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, the primary concern is the comparison of `discrete_features` with the string `'auto'`. This comparison is problematic because `discrete_features` can be a boolean, an array of indices, or a boolean mask, not just a string. The current implementation only directly supports the string `'auto'` and a boolean value, but it does not explicitly handle the case when `discrete_features` is an array.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant parts of the code and the issue at hand:\n\n1. **Comparison with 'auto'**: The code checks if `discrete_features` is equal to `'auto'` to decide whether to automatically determine if features are discrete based on the sparsity of `X`. This is fine, but the issue points out that there's no explicit handling for when `discrete_features` is an array.\n\n2. **Handling of boolean and array inputs**: If `discrete_features` is a boolean, it creates a mask where all features are treated as either discrete or continuous based on the boolean value. If `discrete_features` is not a boolean (implicitly assuming it could be an array), it tries to create a mask where specified indices are marked as discrete. However, this part of the code does not explicitly check if `discrete_features` is indeed an array of indices or a boolean mask, which could lead to errors in future versions of numpy or when the input does not meet the expected format.\n\n3. **Potential for improvement**: The issue suggests that there's no test coverage for scenarios where `discrete_features` is not 'auto'. This implies that the current testing might not be comprehensive enough to catch edge cases or incorrect behavior when `discrete_features` is an array or a boolean mask.\n\nTo address the issue, the following steps are needed:\n\n- **Code Modification**: Update the `_estimate_mi` function to explicitly handle the case when `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask. This involves refining the logic that creates `discrete_mask` and `continuous_mask` to ensure it correctly interprets all possible types of inputs for `discrete_features`.\n\n- **Testing**: Add tests that cover scenarios where `discrete_features` is not 'auto', including when it's a boolean, an array of indices, or a boolean mask. This will help ensure that the function behaves as expected across all valid input types.\n\nThe next step would be to draft a patch that addresses these points, ensuring backward compatibility and adherence to the project's coding standards."
