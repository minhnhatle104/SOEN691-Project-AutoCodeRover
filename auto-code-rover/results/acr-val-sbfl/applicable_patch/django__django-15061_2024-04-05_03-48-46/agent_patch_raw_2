Given the feedback and the need to maintain compatibility with existing functionality while addressing the issue, a revised approach is necessary. The initial patch attempted to introduce an `index` parameter to the `id_for_label` method in the `MultiWidget` class, inspired by the functionality seen in the `ChoiceWidget`. However, considering the failure in tests, it's clear that a different strategy is needed, one that perhaps doesn't alter the method signature to maintain compatibility.

A more conservative approach would be to remove the automatic appending of '_0' to the ID in the `MultiWidget` class or to make this behavior optional based on a class attribute. This way, developers can choose whether or not they want the index appended, similar to the flexibility mentioned in the issue description but without changing the method's parameters.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/widgets.py</file>
<original>    def id_for_label(self, id_):
        if id_:
            id_ += '_0'
        return id_
</original>
<patched>    def id_for_label(self, id_):
        # Removed automatic appending of '_0' to allow for more flexible ID handling
        return id_
</patched>
```

This patch removes the automatic appending of '_0' to the ID within the `id_for_label` method of the `MultiWidget` class. This change addresses the issue by not enforcing a specific ID format, thus providing the flexibility requested. It's a minimal change that avoids altering the method signature or introducing new parameters, which should help in passing the tests that failed previously.
