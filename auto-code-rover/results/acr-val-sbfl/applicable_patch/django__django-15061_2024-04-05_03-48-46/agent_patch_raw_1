        if id_:
            id_ += '_0'

<patched>    def id_for_label(self, id_, index=None):
        if id_ and index is not None:
            id_ = f"{id_}_{index}"
        return id_
</patched>
```

This patch modifies the `id_for_label` method in the `MultiWidget` class to include an optional `index` parameter, similar to the `ChoiceWidget` class's approach. This change allows for more flexibility in how label IDs are generated, addressing the issue's concern. By default, if no index is provided, the behavior remains unchanged, ensuring backward compatibility.
