This patch corrects the handling of proxy models in the `deferred_to_data` method of the `Query` class within Django's ORM layer. By ensuring that the concrete model's metadata is used instead of the proxy model's metadata, this change aims to resolve the issue where a `ValueError` is raised due to the primary key not being found in the list of selected fields when using `select_related()` and `only()` methods together on a proxy model. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining the integrity of Django's ORM operations involving proxy models and field selection optimizations.
