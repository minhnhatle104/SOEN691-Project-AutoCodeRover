        "content": "Based on the issue description and the results from the external analysis tool, we have identified a problem occurring when using `select_related()` and `only()` methods together on a proxy model in Django. The traceback provided in the issue points to a `ValueError` related to the primary key not being found in the list of selected fields when using these methods in conjunction.\n\nThe external analysis tool highlighted several suspicious methods across different files, including `related_query_name` in `related.py`, `select_related` and `only` in `query.py`, `select_related_descend` in `query_utils.py`, and `get_default_columns` in `sql/compiler.py`. These methods are involved in the process of constructing and optimizing queries, particularly when dealing with related objects and field selection.\n\nThe search API call to `search_code_in_file` with the code snippet \"opts = cur_model._meta\" in \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\" led us to the `deferred_to_data` function within the `Query` class. This function is part of the mechanism that handles deferred loading of fields, which is closely related to the use of `only()` for field selection. The code snippet provided in the issue suggests a modification to use `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` instead of just `cur_model._meta` to handle proxy models correctly.\n\nGiven this context, the problem seems to stem from how Django's ORM handles field selection and related object fetching with proxy models. The proposed modification suggests that the current handling does not correctly account for the proxy model's metadata, leading to the observed `ValueError`.\n\nTo address this issue, a patch should ensure that when dealing with proxy models, the system correctly accesses the concrete model's metadata rather than the proxy model's metadata. This adjustment would likely need to be applied in a way that does not disrupt the handling of non-proxy models.\n\nBefore proceeding with a patch, it would be beneficial to further analyze the related methods identified by the external tool to understand their roles in the issue fully and to ensure that the proposed solution does not introduce unintended side effects. However, based on the current analysis, the focus should be on adjusting how metadata is accessed in scenarios involving proxy models, particularly in the context of `select_related()` and `only()` optimizations."
