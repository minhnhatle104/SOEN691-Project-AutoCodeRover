Given the feedback, it appears the initial approach to directly manipulate attributes on the `partial` object might not be the correct solution, or it might have introduced unintended side effects. Let's revise the strategy focusing on ensuring that the wrapper created by `_multi_decorate` properly simulates the attributes of the original function, even when dealing with `functools.partial` objects. This time, we'll ensure the wrapper function `_wrapper` inside `_multi_decorate` retains the necessary function attributes without directly modifying the `partial` object.

        # Apply a list/tuple of decorators if 'decorators' is one. Decorator
        # functions are applied so that the call order is the same as the

        # 'self' argument, but it's a closure over self so it can call
        # 'func'. Also, wrap method.__get__() in a function because new
        # attributes can't be set on bound method objects, only on functions.

    # Copy any attributes that a decorator adds to the function it decorates.

```

This revised patch focuses on ensuring that the `_wrapper` function inside `_multi_decorate` correctly simulates the attributes of the original function, whether it's a direct function or wrapped in a `functools.partial`. By determining the `original_func` (either the function itself or the `func` attribute of a `partial`), and then explicitly setting attributes from `original_func` to `_wrapper`, we aim to preserve the necessary function attributes. Additionally, `update_wrapper` is called with `original_func` to copy over any other relevant attributes, ensuring compatibility with decorators expecting function-like attributes.
