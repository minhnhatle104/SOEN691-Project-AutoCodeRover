To address the issue of `method_decorator()` not preserving wrapper assignments when the function passed to the decorator is a `functools.partial` object, we need to ensure that attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc., are properly handled. Given the context and the code provided, the patch will focus on enhancing the `_multi_decorate` function in `django/utils/decorators.py` to check and manage the attributes of `functools.partial` objects.

Since `functools.partial` objects do not have attributes like `__name__` by default, we can simulate these attributes by copying them from the function wrapped by `partial`. This approach will ensure that decorators expecting these attributes, such as the `logger` function described in the issue, can operate correctly.

Here's the proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/utils/decorators.py</file>
<original>def _multi_decorate(decorators, method):
    """
    Decorate `method` with one or more function decorators. `decorators` can be
    a single decorator or an iterable of decorators.
    """
    if hasattr(decorators, '__iter__'):
        # Apply a list/tuple of decorators if 'decorators' is one. Decorator
        # functions are applied so that the call order is the same as the
        # order in which they appear in the iterable.
        decorators = decorators[::-1]
    else:
        decorators = [decorators]

    def _wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # bound_method has the signature that 'decorator' expects i.e. no
        # 'self' argument, but it's a closure over self so it can call
        # 'func'. Also, wrap method.__get__() in a function because new
        # attributes can't be set on bound method objects, only on functions.
        bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))
        for dec in decorators:
            bound_method = dec(bound_method)
        return bound_method(*args, **kwargs)

    # Copy any attributes that a decorator adds to the function it decorates.
    for dec in decorators:
        _update_method_wrapper(_wrapper, dec)
    # Preserve any existing attributes of 'method', including the name.
    update_wrapper(_wrapper, method)
    return _wrapper
</original>
<patched>from functools import partial, update_wrapper, WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS

def _multi_decorate(decorators, method):

        if isinstance(method, partial):
            for attr in WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS:
                if hasattr(method.func, attr):
                    setattr(bound_method, attr, getattr(method.func, attr))

</patched>
```

This modification ensures that if the `method` being decorated is a `functools.partial` object, the necessary attributes (`__name__`, `__module__`, etc.) are copied from the `method.func` (the original function wrapped by `partial`) to the `bound_method`. This should resolve the issue without affecting the existing functionality for non-`partial` objects.
