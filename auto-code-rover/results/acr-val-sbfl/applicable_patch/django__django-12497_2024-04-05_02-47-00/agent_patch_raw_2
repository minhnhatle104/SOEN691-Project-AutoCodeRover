Given the feedback and the need to address the issue correctly, let's refine the patch to ensure it accurately resolves the problem without causing test failures. The goal is to correct the hint in the error messages for ambiguous foreign key relationships in the intermediary model of a ManyToManyField without introducing errors or inconsistencies.

<file>django/db/models/fields/related.py</file>
<original>                            hint=(
                                'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
                                'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'
                            ) % (
                                RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
                                relationship_model_name,
                            ),</original>
<patched>                            hint=(
                                'If you want to create a recursive relationship with an intermediary model, '
                                'use ManyToManyField and specify the "through" and "through_fields" arguments '
                                'to explicitly state the intermediary model and which two foreign keys to use.'
                            ),</patched>
```

This modification corrects the hint in the error messages by replacing the incorrect suggestion to use `ForeignKey` with the correct advice to use `ManyToManyField` for recursive relationships involving an intermediary model. It also clarifies the need to specify both the `through` and `through_fields` arguments to resolve ambiguities related to foreign keys in the intermediary model. This approach should ensure the hint is both accurate and helpful, guiding developers towards the correct configuration of `ManyToManyField` relationships.
