These modifications correct the misleading hint in the error messages generated by the `_check_relationship_model` method in the `ManyToManyField` class. The updated hint now accurately advises on specifying `through_fields` for `ManyToManyField` in cases of recursive relationships with an intermediary model, instead of incorrectly suggesting the use of `ForeignKey` with unsupported arguments.
