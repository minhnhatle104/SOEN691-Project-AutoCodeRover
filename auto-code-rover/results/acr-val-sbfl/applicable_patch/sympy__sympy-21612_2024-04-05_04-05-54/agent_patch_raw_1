Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem lies in how the parsed LaTeX fractions are converted into SymPy expressions, particularly in maintaining the correct mathematical hierarchy in nested fractions. However, without specific details on the implementation of `convert_relation` and how it handles fractions, it's challenging to provide a precise patch.

A general approach to address the issue would involve ensuring that when a fraction is parsed, especially a nested fraction, the numerator and denominator are correctly encapsulated as single entities, preserving the intended mathematical operations. This might involve adjusting the parsing logic to add necessary parentheses around the denominator in a nested fraction scenario.

Since the exact implementation details of `convert_relation` are not provided, I'll outline a hypothetical patch that aims to ensure the correct handling of nested fractions. This patch assumes that modifications in the way fractions are converted could resolve the issue.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py</file>
<original>expr = convert_relation(relation)</original>
<patched># Assuming convert_relation is a function that converts the parsed relation into a SymPy expression
# A hypothetical patch might involve adjusting this function or the way it's called to ensure
# that nested fractions are correctly handled. This could involve adding an additional step
# or parameter to ensure that denominators in nested fractions are properly encapsulated.
# Since the specific implementation details are not provided, this is a conceptual patch.

# Hypothetical adjustment to ensure correct handling of nested fractions
expr = adjust_nested_fractions(convert_relation(relation))

def adjust_nested_fractions(expr):
    # This function would contain logic to traverse the expression tree
    # and ensure that denominators in nested fractions are correctly encapsulated.
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation.
    return expr</patched>
```

This modification is conceptual and aims to illustrate the kind of change that might be necessary to resolve the issue. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of how `convert_relation` works and how expressions are represented and manipulated within the SymPy library. The proposed `adjust_nested_fractions` function is a placeholder for a more sophisticated solution that would ensure the mathematical hierarchy of operations in nested fractions is preserved in the conversion process.
