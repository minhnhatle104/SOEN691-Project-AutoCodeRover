Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the `convert_relation` function or the ability to modify the core parsing logic directly, providing a precise and applicable patch is challenging. The issue stems from the parsing and conversion process not correctly handling the mathematical hierarchy in nested fractions, specifically not encapsulating the denominator of a nested fraction properly.

A more targeted approach would require a deeper dive into the parsing logic, particularly how fractions are handled during the conversion from the LaTeX representation to the SymPy expression. Since the provided context does not include details on the `convert_relation` function or other internal mechanisms that directly handle the conversion of parsed fractions, any patch would be speculative.

However, based on common practices in handling such parsing issues, a general approach might involve ensuring that during the conversion process, fractions, especially nested ones, are treated such that their numerators and denominators are considered as single, encapsulated expressions. This often involves introducing or ensuring the presence of parentheses around expressions to maintain the correct order of operations.

Without the ability to directly modify the relevant parsing and conversion functions, a hypothetical solution would focus on the conceptual approach of enhancing the handling of fraction denominators in nested scenarios. This would likely involve adjusting the parsing rules or the conversion logic to automatically introduce parentheses around the denominator of a fraction when it is itself a fraction or contains complex expressions, ensuring the mathematical integrity of the expression.

Given the limitations and the lack of specific implementation details, I recommend a review of the parsing rules and conversion logic related to fractions in the `convert_relation` function or similar, with a focus on enhancing the handling of nested fractions. This would involve a detailed examination of the parsing library's capabilities and potentially extending or adjusting them to better support complex fraction expressions.

For actionable steps, it would be advisable to:

1. Review the implementation of `convert_relation` and any associated functions or logic that handle the conversion of parsed LaTeX fractions into SymPy expressions.
2. Identify where and how the mathematical hierarchy might be getting lost or misrepresented during the conversion, particularly for nested fractions.
3. Implement adjustments to ensure that denominators in nested fractions are correctly encapsulated, potentially by introducing parentheses or treating them as single expressions during the conversion process.

Given the speculative nature of this guidance and the lack of direct access to modify the code, further investigation and testing within the actual codebase would be necessary to develop and apply an effective patch.
