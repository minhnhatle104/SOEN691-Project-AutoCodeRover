However, based on the issue description and the nature of the problem, it's likely that the bug resides within the implementation of the `parse_latex` function or within the logic that handles the representation and manipulation of fractions as a result of parsing. This would suggest that the bug could be located in the file and method where `parse_latex` is implemented or in related utility functions that handle the conversion of parsed LaTeX fractions into the internal representation used by the library."
