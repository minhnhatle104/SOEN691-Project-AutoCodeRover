The issue suggests that `AlterField.reduce` does not handle cases where the operation is also an `AlterField`, leading to a lack of optimization. To gather more context and find the relevant sections of the codebase to patch, we should:\n\n1. Look into the migration optimizer class to understand how it currently optimizes operations.\n2. Investigate the `AlterField` class, especially focusing on the `reduce` method mentioned in the issue.\n\nBased on this, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationOptimizer\")`: This will help us find the migration optimizer class to understand its optimization logic.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"reduce\", \"AlterField\")`: This will help us find the `reduce` method within the `AlterField` class to see how it currently handles reduction and why it might not be optimizing `AlterField` operations correctly.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls."
