<patched># Check if the builder is for epub and viewcode is disabled for epub
if app.builder.format == 'epub' and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:
        return</patched>
```

Explanation:
The original condition `if app.builder.name.startswith("epub") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:` checks if the builder's name starts with "epub" and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False` to decide whether to proceed with the `viewcode` processing for epub outputs. However, this approach might not be reliable if the builder's name does not strictly start with "epub" or if there are variations in naming conventions for different epub builders.

The patched version changes the condition to check the builder's format directly using `app.builder.format == 'epub'`, which is a more reliable and explicit way to determine if the current build is targeting epub output. This ensures that the check accurately captures all epub generation scenarios, addressing the issue where `viewcode` pages were being created for epub even when `viewcode_enable_epub` was set to `False`.
