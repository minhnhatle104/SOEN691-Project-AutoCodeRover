Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial attempts did not resolve the issue, it's clear that the approach needs to be reconsidered. The core of the problem lies in the condition that checks if `viewcode` pages should be generated for epub outputs based on the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration. The original code snippet provided does not seem to have an obvious flaw in its logic regarding this functionality.

However, since the issue persists and the initial patch did not resolve it, it's possible that the problem might not be with the condition itself but perhaps with how or when this condition is evaluated in the broader context of the Sphinx build process. Without the ability to introduce new diagnostic information or having specific insights into the test failures, crafting a precise patch is challenging.

Given the information at hand and the need to address the issue based on the original description and the code provided, let's reconsider the original code snippet and focus on ensuring that the condition to check the `viewcode_enable_epub` flag is as intended. Since direct modification did not yield the desired outcome, and without further specific details to guide the patch, we are at an impasse regarding proposing a new, actionable patch.

In real-world scenarios, the next steps would typically involve:
- Reviewing the Sphinx build process in more detail, especially how builders are initialized and how configurations are applied.
- Investigating how the `viewcode` extension interacts with different builders, with a focus on epub.
- Conducting a detailed review of test failures to identify any patterns or specific conditions under which the issue manifests.

Without the ability to perform these actions or access more detailed information through this interface, we've reached the limit of how we can proceed with proposing a new patch. The resolution of this issue would likely require a deeper dive into the Sphinx project's internals and possibly more detailed logs or error messages from the test failures to guide the debugging process.
