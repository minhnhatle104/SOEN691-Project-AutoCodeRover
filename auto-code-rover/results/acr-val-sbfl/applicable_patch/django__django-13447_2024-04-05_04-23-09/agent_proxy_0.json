Specifically, we need to understand how the `app_list` is currently being handled and how the `_build_app_dict` method is implemented and used. Given the information provided in the issue, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `_build_app_dict` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us understand where this method is defined and how it's currently being used, which is crucial for making it public as suggested in the issue.\n\n2. **Search for the usage of `app_list` in the codebase**: Since `app_list` is mentioned as a key part of the context that needs manipulation, finding where and how it is used will provide insights into the necessary modifications to include the model class.\n\nTherefore, the API calls I would make are:\n\n- `search_method(method_name=\"_build_app_dict\")`\n- `search_code(code_str=\"app_list\")`"
