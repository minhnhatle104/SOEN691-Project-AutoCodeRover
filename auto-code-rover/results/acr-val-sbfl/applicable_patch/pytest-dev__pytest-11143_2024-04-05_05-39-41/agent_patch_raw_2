Given the feedback and the need to directly address the issue of a number being mistaken for a docstring, it seems the best approach is to ensure that the module's content is correctly interpreted before the assertion rewriting process begins. The initial patch attempted to handle the symptom rather than preventing the issue at its source. Let's focus on ensuring that the module's first expression is correctly identified and handled, particularly before any checks for disabling rewrite based on docstrings.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>    def is_rewrite_disabled(docstring: str) -> bool:
        return "PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE" in docstring
</original>
<patched>    def is_rewrite_disabled(docstring: Optional[Union[str, int]]) -> bool:
        if isinstance(docstring, str):
            return "PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE" in docstring
        return False
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that `is_rewrite_disabled` can handle cases where the "docstring" is not actually a string, directly addressing the issue of a number being misinterpreted as a docstring. By checking the type of `docstring` before attempting to search within it, we avoid the `TypeError` that was being raised.

However, upon reflection, the root cause seems to be earlier in the process, where the module's content is interpreted. The `exec_module` method and the process leading up to the call to `is_rewrite_disabled` should ensure that the first expression of a file is correctly identified as a docstring or not. Since the initial patch did not resolve the issue and without direct access to the part of the code where the module's content is initially parsed or loaded, a more precise patch cannot be provided without further context.

The proposed modification to `is_rewrite_disabled` aims to make the system more robust in the face of unexpected input types, but it's important to note that a comprehensive solution would likely involve adjustments to how modules are pre-processed before assertion rewriting checks are applied. This might include better detection and handling of initial expressions in test files to ensure that non-docstring content is not misinterpreted.
