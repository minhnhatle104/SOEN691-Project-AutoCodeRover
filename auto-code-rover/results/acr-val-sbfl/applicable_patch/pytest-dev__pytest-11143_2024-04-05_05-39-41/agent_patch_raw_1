                raise TypeError(f"TypeError encountered while trying to execute module {module.__name__}. "
                                "This may be caused by a non-string (e.g., number) at the beginning of the file, "
                                "which is being mistaken for a docstring.") from e
            raise

```

These modifications address the issue by first ensuring that the `is_rewrite_disabled` function can gracefully handle cases where the input is not a string, which could occur if the first expression in a file is mistakenly treated as a docstring. The second modification adds error handling around the `exec` call in `exec_module` to provide a more informative error message if a `TypeError` related to iterability occurs, suggesting a possible cause related to the file's initial content. This approach aims to make the error more understandable to the user and hints at a potential fix, without fundamentally changing how pytest processes test files.
