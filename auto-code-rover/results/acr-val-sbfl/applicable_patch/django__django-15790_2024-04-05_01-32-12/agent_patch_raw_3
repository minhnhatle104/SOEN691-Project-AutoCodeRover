Given the constraints and the need to address the issue without causing disruptions to existing functionality or failing tests, a refined approach is necessary. The goal will be to ensure that the system can handle template tag libraries with the same name more gracefully, without immediately raising errors or logging warnings that might not be appropriate in all contexts. Let's focus on enhancing the system's ability to manage potential conflicts internally.

                # Instead of overwriting or raising an error, check if the paths are identical
                # If they are, it's safe to proceed without action as it's not a true conflict
                existing_library = loaded[name]
                if hasattr(existing_library, '__path__') and existing_library.__path__ == path:
                    continue
                else:
                    # If paths differ, append a unique identifier to the name to avoid conflict
                    # This approach allows multiple libraries with the same name to coexist
                    unique_name = f"{name}_{path.replace('.', '_').replace('/', '_')}"
                    loaded[unique_name] = import_library(path)
            else:
                loaded[name] = import_library(path)
        return loaded
</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a different approach to handling duplicate library names in the `get_template_libraries` method. Instead of logging a warning or raising an error when duplicates are detected, it first checks if the duplicate name refers to a library with the same path. If the paths are identical, it's considered safe to ignore the duplicate since it doesn't introduce any new library into the system.

If the paths differ, indicating a potential conflict, the patch introduces a mechanism to allow both libraries to coexist by appending a unique identifier to the library name based on its path. This ensures that each library can be uniquely identified and accessed without overwriting each other, addressing the issue of handling template tag libraries with the same name in a backward-compatible manner.
