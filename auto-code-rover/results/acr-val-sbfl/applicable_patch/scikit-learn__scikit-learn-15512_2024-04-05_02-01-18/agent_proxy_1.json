The key components of the `AffinityPropagation` class, including its `fit` and `predict` methods, have been examined. Additionally, the behavior of `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` in non-convergence scenarios has been identified as the core of the issue. Therefore, no further context from the project is needed at this moment.\n\n- **Where are bug locations**:\n\nBuggy File: `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py`\n\nBuggy Methods:\n1. `fit`: This method needs to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that it behaves as documented when the algorithm does not converge. Specifically, it should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `-1` for each label in `labels_` in case of non-convergence.\n2. Documentation or Comments: Depending on the decision (whether to change the code to match the documentation or update the documentation to reflect the current behavior), the documentation/comments within the `AffinityPropagation` class or its methods may also need to be updated to accurately describe the behavior in non-convergence scenarios."
