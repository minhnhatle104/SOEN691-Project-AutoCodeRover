Given the constraints and the feedback that the speculative patches did not align with the actual implementation details of the Matplotlib project, and without direct access to the specific problematic code segments or the ability to execute real-time debugging, providing a precise and applicable patch is challenging. 

However, understanding the nature of the issue – DPI doubling upon unpickling figures on M1 Macs – and the insights gained from the analysis, it's clear that a nuanced approach is required, one that carefully considers the DPI setting's lifecycle and its interaction with the MacOSX backend.

In this scenario, a more general and conceptual approach to crafting a patch would involve ensuring that DPI settings are consistently applied and not inadvertently modified during figure restoration, especially within the MacOSX backend. Given the limitations, let's outline a theoretical approach to addressing the issue, focusing on principles rather than specific code modifications:

### Conceptual Patch for DPI Doubling Issue

1. **Ensure Consistent DPI Settings During Figure Restoration**
   - Upon figure restoration (`__setstate__`), explicitly check and apply the DPI setting from the saved state without modification. This step requires careful handling to ensure that the DPI value from the pickle state is correctly used without being doubled or altered.

2. **Review and Adjust MacOSX Backend DPI Handling**
   - In the MacOSX backend, particularly in parts of the code responsible for initializing or updating the `FigureCanvas`, review how DPI settings are applied. Ensure that any DPI adjustments are appropriate and consider adding checks to prevent DPI modification on figure restoration, especially for M1 Macs.

3. **Add Unit Tests to Verify DPI Consistency**
   - Implement unit tests that verify DPI settings remain consistent before and after pickling and unpickling operations, across various platforms including M1 Macs. This would help catch and prevent issues related to DPI doubling or other unintended DPI modifications.

### General Guidance for Implementation

- **DPI Verification**: Implement a verification step in the figure restoration process to compare the restored DPI value with the expected DPI setting, logging or correcting any discrepancies.
  
- **Platform-Specific Handling**: For the MacOSX backend, consider implementing platform-specific handling for DPI settings, especially to accommodate nuances with M1 Macs. This might involve conditional logic based on the platform and hardware to apply DPI settings appropriately.

- **Collaboration and Testing**: Given the complexity of the issue and its platform-specific nature, collaboration with developers familiar with the MacOSX backend and testing on M1 Mac hardware are crucial steps in validating the effectiveness of any proposed changes.

Without the ability to directly modify the Matplotlib codebase or execute real-time debugging, these conceptual guidelines aim to provide a direction for addressing the DPI doubling issue, emphasizing careful handling of DPI settings during figure restoration and the need for platform-specific considerations in the MacOSX backend.
