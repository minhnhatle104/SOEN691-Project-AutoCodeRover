Given the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the implementation of the Knuth-Cohen bound. Let's correct the approach based on the typical formula for the Knuth-Cohen bound. The Knuth-Cohen bound for polynomial factorization is more involved than a simple replacement of the Mignotte bound formula. However, without explicit details on the correct formula for the Knuth-Cohen bound in the context of the issue, a precise implementation might involve assumptions. Typically, the Knuth-Cohen bound involves terms related to the polynomial's degree and the size of its coefficients, similar to the Mignotte bound but with different coefficients and potentially additional terms.

Let's assume a more generic improvement based on typical characteristics of the Knuth-Cohen bound, noting that specific coefficients and terms might need adjustment based on the exact mathematical formulation, which was not provided.

This revised patch assumes a more generic form of improvement for the Knuth-Cohen bound, incorporating a logarithmic term which is often part of more sophisticated bounds compared to the simpler Mignotte bound. However, without specific details on the Knuth-Cohen bound formula to be used, this implementation is speculative and should be verified against the actual mathematical definition intended by the issue submitter.
