The issue points out that `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel` should be made hashable, which is not currently the case. To gather more context and find the relevant code to patch, we will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `ManyToManyRel` class to understand its structure and current implementation.\n2. Search for the `make_hashable` method to see how it's implemented and used in other parts of the codebase.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_class(\"ManyToManyRel\")`\n- `search_method(\"make_hashable\")`"
