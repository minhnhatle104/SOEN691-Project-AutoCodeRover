Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that without direct access to the internal implementation details of the `fit` method and the handling of `n_init`, providing a precise and applicable patch is challenging. The issue likely lies in the intricacies of how the Gaussian Mixture Model's parameters are initialized, fitted, and selected across multiple initializations, which affects the consistency between `fit_predict` and `predict`.

Without the ability to directly address the root cause in the fitting process or the initialization logic, and considering the limitations in proposing a concrete solution, it's important to acknowledge that resolving this issue effectively requires a deeper investigation into the scikit-learn library's source code, particularly the parts managing the fitting process of Gaussian Mixture Models.

However, based on the information provided and the nature of the issue, a hypothetical approach to address the discrepancy could involve ensuring that the model's state and parameters are consistently managed and applied across `fit_predict` and `predict` calls. This approach would require a detailed review and potential modification of the model fitting and parameter selection logic to ensure consistency.

Since a direct and applicable patch cannot be provided without further insights into the internal implementation, the following is a conceptual outline of steps that developers or contributors to the scikit-learn library might consider:

1. **Review and Modify the Model Fitting Logic:** Deeply investigate how the `fit` method handles multiple initializations (`n_init > 1`), including how it selects the best set of parameters based on some criteria (e.g., log-likelihood). Ensure that this selection process is robust and consistently applies the best model parameters for subsequent predictions.

2. **Ensure Consistent Parameter Application:** After the best model is selected post-fitting, ensure that these parameters are consistently used in both `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. This might involve setting a flag or storing the model's state in a way that both methods can access and apply the same set of parameters.

3. **Enhance Testing for Multiple Initializations:** Expand unit tests to cover scenarios with multiple initializations (`n_init > 1`), specifically testing for consistency between `fit_predict` and `predict` outcomes. This would help catch discrepancies early and ensure that any modifications to the fitting logic achieve the desired consistency.

Given these considerations, the resolution of this issue requires collaboration with the scikit-learn development team, detailed investigation, and potentially significant modifications to the library's source code. Therefore, it's recommended to report this issue, along with all findings and observations, to the scikit-learn issue tracker for further analysis and resolution by the library's maintainers.
