Given the context and the nature of the issue, the root cause seems to be related to how the model parameters are selected and used in the `predict` method after fitting the model with multiple initializations (`n_init > 1`). Since we identified that the `predict` method does not directly cause the issue but rather how the model parameters are managed after fitting, we need to ensure consistent use of the best set of parameters chosen after multiple initializations for both `fit_predict` and subsequent `predict` calls.

However, without direct access to the `fit` method's implementation and how `n_init` is handled, we can propose a conceptual patch that ensures the model parameters (`self.means_` and any other relevant parameters) are consistently updated and used after the model is fitted with multiple initializations. This conceptual patch assumes that the fitting process selects the best model based on some criteria (e.g., log-likelihood) and updates the model's parameters accordingly.

# Ensure the model uses the best set of parameters after fitting with multiple initializations
# This is a conceptual patch; the actual implementation may require adjustments
# based on how the best parameters are selected and stored during the fitting process.
if hasattr(self, '_best_params'):
    self.means_ = self._best_params['means']
    # Update other relevant parameters similarly, e.g., weights, covariances, etc.

return self._estimate_weighted_log_prob(X).argmax(axis=1)
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that after fitting the model with multiple initializations, the best set of parameters (e.g., means, covariances) is stored in an attribute (conceptually named `_best_params` here). Before predicting, we ensure that the model uses this best set of parameters. This approach requires that the fitting process is modified to store the best parameters upon completion, which is not shown here due to the lack of direct access to the `fit` method's implementation details.

Please note, this is a high-level conceptual patch. The actual implementation may vary based on the internal workings of the `GaussianMixture` fitting process, especially regarding how multiple initializations are handled and how the best model parameters are selected and stored.
