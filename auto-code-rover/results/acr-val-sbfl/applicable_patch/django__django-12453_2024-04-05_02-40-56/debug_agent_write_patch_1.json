I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\nfrom django.utils.six import StringIO\nfrom django.utils.six.moves import input\n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\nthe serialize_db_to_string method.\n\"\"\"\ndata = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\ndef _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\ndef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n# ...\nwith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\nself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search results, let's analyze the issue and the proposed solution in detail.\n\n### Issue Analysis\n\nThe issue at hand involves the `TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` feature in Django, which fails to restore objects correctly due to ordering constraints. This problem arises because the serialization process does not account for the order in which models referenced by foreign keys should be deserialized to maintain integrity constraints. Specifically, the `serialize_db_to_string` method serializes models without considering the dependencies between models that are enforced by foreign keys. Consequently, when `deserialize_db_from_string` attempts to restore the database state, it can encounter integrity errors if a model that references another model through a foreign key is deserialized before the model it depends on.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution involves wrapping the deserialization process in a transaction, as shown in the provided diff. This approach is consistent with how Django's `loaddata` command handles deserialization, which wraps the entire process in a transaction to avoid similar integrity errors.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n- **`BaseDatabaseCreation` Class**: This class is responsible for creating and managing the test database. It includes methods for serializing and deserializing the database state, which are crucial for implementing the `serialized_rollback` feature. The proposed changes directly affect this class.\n\n- **`serialize_db_to_string` Method**: This method serializes the entire database into a JSON string. It uses `serializers.sort_dependencies` to order the models before serialization. However, as the issue description points out, this sorting does not account for foreign key dependencies in a way that would prevent integrity errors during deserialization.\n\n- **`deserialize_db_from_string` Method**: Currently, this method deserializes objects from a string and saves them to the database without wrapping the process in a transaction. The proposed change is to wrap the deserialization and saving of objects in a transaction by using `transaction.atomic`, which should prevent integrity errors by ensuring that all objects are saved in a consistent state or not at all if an error occurs.\n\n- **Usage of `transaction.atomic`**: The search results show that wrapping operations in transactions is a common pattern in Django, especially when dealing with operations that need to maintain database integrity. The proposed change aligns with these practices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe proposed patch is a straightforward and effective solution to the problem. By wrapping the deserialization process in a transaction, it ensures that either all objects are restored to their correct state, respecting foreign key constraints, or none are, thus preventing partial and inconsistent database states. This change should be thoroughly tested, especially in scenarios involving complex model dependencies and circular foreign keys, to ensure that it does not introduce any regressions or new issues."
