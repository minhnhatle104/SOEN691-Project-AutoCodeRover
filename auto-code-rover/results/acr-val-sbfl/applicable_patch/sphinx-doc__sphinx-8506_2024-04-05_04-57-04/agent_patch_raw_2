Given the feedback and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, a more nuanced approach may be required. The initial attempt aimed to make the regular expression more permissive, but this might have unintended consequences or may not fully address the validation logic's requirements.

A more targeted approach could involve adjusting the validation logic in the `handle_signature` method to specifically allow for the `[enable=]PATTERN` syntax, without broadly changing the regular expression that could affect other parts of the documentation validation. This approach focuses on handling the specific case mentioned in the issue, while minimizing the impact on the existing validation rules.

Here's a revised patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/domains/std.py</file>
<original>if not m:
    logger.warning(__('Malformed option description %r, should '
                      'look like "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", '
                      '"/opt args" or "+opt args"'), potential_option,
                   location=signode)
    continue</original>
<patched>if not m:
    # Check for specific pattern [enable=]PATTERN and allow it explicitly
    if not re.match(r'\[\w+=\][^\s]+', potential_option):
        logger.warning(__('Malformed option description %r, should '
                          'look like "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", '
                          '"/opt args" or "+opt args", or "[enable=]PATTERN"'), potential_option,
                       location=signode)
        continue
    # Extract option name and args for the specific allowed pattern
    optname, args = re.match(r'\[(\w+)=\]([^\s]+)', potential_option).groups()
    args = '=' + args  # Prepend '=' to args to match the expected format</patched>
```

This modification introduces a specific check for the `[enable=]PATTERN` syntax before logging a warning for a malformed option description. If the `potential_option` matches this specific pattern, the method proceeds to extract the option name and arguments, adjusting the format to fit the expected structure for further processing. This way, the specific syntax that caused the issue is explicitly allowed, while the general validation logic remains unchanged for other option descriptions.

This approach aims to resolve the issue by providing a targeted fix for the reported problem, ensuring that the `[enable=]PATTERN` syntax is accepted without altering the validation of other option formats. It's crucial to test this patch thoroughly to confirm that it addresses the issue as intended and does not introduce any new problems.
