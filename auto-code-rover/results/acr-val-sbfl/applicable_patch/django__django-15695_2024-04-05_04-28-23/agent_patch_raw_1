Explanation:
The modification addresses the issue where `RenameIndex.database_backwards` does not properly handle the scenario of unnamed indexes moving backward and then forward again. By checking if the index exists in the `from_state` before proceeding with the renaming operation, the patch ensures that only indexes that were previously renamed (and thus exist in the `from_state`) are considered for restoration to their original names. This approach avoids the crash caused by attempting to rename an index that does not exist or was not previously renamed, aligning with the expected behavior of restoring the old auto-generated name for unnamed indexes during backward migrations.
