Therefore, the suspicious methods identified by the external analysis tool might not be directly relevant to the issue at hand. Instead, we should focus on the functionality around generating monomials. Given this, the relevant function based on the issue description is `itermonomials`. Let's start by searching for this method in the entire codebase to understand its implementation and context.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"itermonomials\")\n```"
