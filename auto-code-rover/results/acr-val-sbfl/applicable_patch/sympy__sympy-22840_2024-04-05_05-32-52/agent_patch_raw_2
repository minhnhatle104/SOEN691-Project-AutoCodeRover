Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, it seems the issue might not be directly related to the uniqueness of the `MatrixSymbol` names but rather how the expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` instances are reconstructed and substituted back after the CSE process. The initial analysis might have misinterpreted the core problem. Let's attempt a different approach focusing on ensuring that the matrix elements are correctly handled during the CSE process, especially in the context of substitution and rebuilding of expressions.

                # Instead of directly creating a new MatrixSymbol, check if orig_expr is a MatrixSymbol
                # and handle its elements individually to preserve the structure and indexing.
                if isinstance(orig_expr, MatrixSymbol):
                    # Create a new symbol for each element in the matrix
                    new_matrix_elements = [[next(symbols) for j in range(orig_expr.cols)] for i in range(orig_expr.rows)]
                    new_matrix = Matrix(orig_expr.rows, orig_expr.cols, lambda i, j: new_matrix_elements[i][j])
                    for i in range(orig_expr.rows):
                        for j in range(orig_expr.cols):
                            subs[orig_expr[i, j]] = new_matrix[i, j]
                    replacements.append((orig_expr, new_matrix))
                    return new_matrix
                else:
                    sym = MatrixSymbol(sym.name, orig_expr.rows, orig_expr.cols)</patched>

Explanation:
This modification takes a different approach by focusing on how expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` instances are handled during the CSE process. Instead of treating the entire `MatrixSymbol` as a single entity to be replaced, this patch proposes handling each element of the `MatrixSymbol` individually. When an original expression is identified as a `MatrixSymbol`, instead of creating a new `MatrixSymbol` for it, the patch creates individual symbols for each element within the matrix. This ensures that the structure and indexing of the matrix are preserved during the CSE process, potentially resolving the issue related to strange behavior with `MatrixSymbol` indexing. This approach aims to maintain the integrity of matrix operations and their elements throughout the simplification process.
