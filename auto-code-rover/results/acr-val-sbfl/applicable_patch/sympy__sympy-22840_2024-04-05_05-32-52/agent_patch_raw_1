Explanation:
The patch addresses the issue where `MatrixSymbol` instances might not be uniquely identified during the common subexpression elimination (CSE) process, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing these symbols. By ensuring that each `MatrixSymbol` created during the CSE process has a unique name, we can avoid potential conflicts and ensure that the indexing and substitution of `MatrixSymbol` elements are handled correctly. This is achieved by checking if the generated symbol name conflicts with any existing symbol names within the expressions being processed and, if so, appending a counter to the name to make it unique.
