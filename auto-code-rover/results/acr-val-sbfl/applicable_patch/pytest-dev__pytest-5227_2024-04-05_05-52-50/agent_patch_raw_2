Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's crucial to reassess the approach. However, based on the information provided and the constraints of this interaction, I cannot directly run or evaluate tests to understand why they failed. Typically, test failures after such a change could be due to hard-coded expectations about the log format in the tests themselves or related functionality that depends on the specific format of the logs.

Without the ability to directly inspect test failures or further details on the specific tests that failed, I can only hypothesize that ensuring all related documentation, help messages, and potentially any test cases that rely on the log format are updated to match the new format would be the next step.

Given this, I'll reiterate the patch with an emphasis on ensuring that any developer or user-facing documentation and help messages are clear about the change. Additionally, it's worth considering if any internal mechanisms or tests explicitly depend on the old log format, they would need to be identified and updated accordingly. However, without the ability to search or modify test files directly based on feedback, this patch will focus on the code changes as initially outlined.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/logging.py</file>
<original>DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s"</original>
<patched>DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s"</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/logging.py</file>
<original>add_option_ini(
        "--log-format",
        dest="log_format",
        default=DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT,
        help="log format as used by the logging module.",
    )</original>
<patched>add_option_ini(
        "--log-format",
        dest="log_format",
        default=DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT,
        help="Enhanced log format including the module name and filename.",
    )</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>src/_pytest/logging.py</file>
<original>add_option_ini(
        "--log-file-format",
        dest="log_file_format",
        default=DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT,
        help="log format as used by the logging module.",
    )</original>
<patched>add_option_ini(
        "--log-file-format",
        dest="log_file_format",
        default=DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT,
        help="Enhanced log file format including the module name and filename.",
    )</patched>
```

This approach maintains the initial changes to the log format but attempts to clarify the help messages for the affected command-line options. If tests are failing due to expectations about the log format, a review of the test suite for hardcoded expectations would be necessary, adjusting them to accommodate or recognize the new format.
