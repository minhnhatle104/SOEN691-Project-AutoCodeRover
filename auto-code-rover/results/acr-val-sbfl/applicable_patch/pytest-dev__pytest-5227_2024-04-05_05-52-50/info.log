The `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` string's definition and its usage in the `pytest_addoption` method within the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file are directly related to the issue at hand.

Identify where the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is defined and used within the project, which was found in `src/_pytest/logging.py`.\n2. Understand how this default logging format is applied and potentially propose modifications to include the module name and consider the inclusion of the relative path in the logging output, as per the issue description.\n\nIf the task requires identifying additional specific methods or lines of code that interact with the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` beyond its definition and usage in command-line option defaults, the information provided does not specify other areas to investigate.
