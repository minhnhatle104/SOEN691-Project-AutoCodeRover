Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems the problem arises when pytest tries to handle exceptions during the capturing process, especially when an exception is raised in the `__repr__` method of a class. The issue is likely not with the capturing mechanism per se but with how exceptions raised during capturing (especially in `__repr__`) are handled or reported. However, without a clear indication of a specific bug in the provided code snippets or a clear path to reproduce the issue outside of the provided traceback, suggesting a precise patch is challenging.

A general approach to mitigate issues like this could involve adding exception handling around calls that could invoke user-defined methods like `__repr__`, which might raise exceptions. This would prevent the test framework from crashing due to unhandled exceptions in user code. However, since the provided code snippets and context do not pinpoint a specific location where such handling is missing or faulty, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a general approach rather than a specific fix.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/capture.py</file>
<original>def read_global_capture(self):
    return self._global_capturing.readouterr()</original>
<patched>def read_global_capture(self):
    try:
        return self._global_capturing.readouterr()
    except Exception as e:
        return ("Error capturing output: " + str(e), "Error capturing output: " + str(e))</patched>
```

This modification wraps the `read_global_capture` method's call to `self._global_capturing.readouterr()` in a try-except block. If an exception occurs (which could be due to issues in user-defined methods like `__repr__`), it catches the exception and returns a tuple indicating that an error occurred during output capturing. This approach ensures that the framework can handle exceptions gracefully without crashing.

Please note, this patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to handling exceptions in capturing mechanisms. The actual issue might require a more specific or different solution based on a deeper analysis and understanding of the pytest framework's internals and the exact cause of the `INTERNALERROR`.
