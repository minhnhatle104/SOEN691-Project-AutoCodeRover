Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, it's clear that a more nuanced approach is needed. The issue arises from exceptions thrown within the `__repr__` method, which is not directly handled by the provided code snippets. However, the traceback suggests that the problem occurs when pytest attempts to report an error and calls `__repr__` on an object that raises an exception.

A more appropriate patch might involve ensuring that pytest can gracefully handle exceptions thrown by `__repr__` methods of objects it tries to report on. Since the direct modification of the `read_global_capture` method didn't address the issue, we should consider a broader approach that targets the reporting mechanism itself, particularly how exceptions are formatted for reports.

Given the traceback and the context, it seems that the exception handling during the reporting phase might not be robust against exceptions thrown by `__repr__`. Unfortunately, without specific code snippets that show how pytest formats exceptions for reports, we can only speculate on a general solution.

A hypothetical patch would involve wrapping calls to `__repr__` (or any similar method that could invoke `__repr__`) in a try-except block during the reporting phase. This would catch exceptions thrown by `__repr__` and replace them with a generic message or a simplified representation that doesn't risk raising further exceptions.

Since the exact location within the pytest codebase where this handling should be implemented is not clear from the provided information, the following patch is speculative and intended to illustrate the concept:

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py</file>
<original>s = repr(x)</original>
<patched>try:
    s = repr(x)
except Exception as e:
    s = f"<Exception in __repr__: {e}>"</patched>
```

This modification targets a hypothetical location in the pytest codebase where objects are represented for reporting purposes. It wraps the call to `repr(x)` in a try-except block. If `repr(x)` raises an exception (which could happen if `x.__repr__` is implemented in a way that raises an exception), it catches this exception and replaces the intended representation with a message indicating that an exception occurred within `__repr__`. This ensures that pytest can continue its reporting without being interrupted by such exceptions.

Please note, this patch is based on a speculative understanding of the pytest codebase structure and the issue's nature. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific code paths involved in exception reporting within pytest.
