Given the feedback and the need to correct the approach, let's refine the patch to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior and addresses the issue without causing test failures. The initial attempt might have overlooked the necessity to maintain compatibility with the existing matrix multiplication behavior while adding the required validation. Let's attempt a revised patch that focuses on validating the operand types more accurately before proceeding with the operation.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/matrices/common.py</file>
<original>    def __matmul__(self, other):
        return self.__mul__(other)</original>
<patched>    def __matmul__(self, other):
        from sympy.matrices.matrices import MatrixBase
        if not isinstance(other, MatrixBase):
            raise ValueError("Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead for scalar multiplication.")
        return self._eval_matrix_mul(other)</patched>
```

This revised patch ensures that the `__matmul__` method first checks if the `other` operand is an instance of `MatrixBase`, which is a common base class for matrix-like objects in SymPy. If the operand is not a matrix, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that scalar operands are not allowed with the `@` operator, directing users to use the `*` operator for scalar multiplication instead. This approach should prevent scalar values from being used with `@` while allowing matrix-to-matrix multiplication to proceed as expected.
