Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to ensure the logic accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231 for handling two-digit years. The goal is to interpret a two-digit year in a way that if it appears to be more than 50 years in the future, it is considered to represent the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits. This requires a careful adjustment of the year calculation logic.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/utils/http.py</file>
<original>if year < 100:
    if year < 70:
        year += 2000
    else:
        year += 1900</original>
<patched>if year < 100:
    # Determine the current year
    current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
    # Calculate the full year assuming it's in the current century
    assumed_year = (current_year // 100) * 100 + year
    # If the assumed_year is more than 50 years ahead of the current year, adjust the year to the previous century
    if assumed_year - current_year > 50:
        year = assumed_year - 100
    # If the assumed_year is 50 years or less ahead, or in the past, it's considered correct
    else:
        year = assumed_year</patched>
```

This modification addresses the issue by dynamically calculating the century for a two-digit year based on the current year. It first assumes the year is in the current century and then checks if this assumption places the year more than 50 years in the future. If so, it adjusts the year to the previous century. This approach aligns with the guidelines from RFC 7231, ensuring that the `parse_http_date` method interprets two-digit years in a manner that is both dynamic and contextually aware of the current date.
