        "content": "Analyzing the provided code snippet from `django/utils/http.py` for the `parse_http_date` method, we can identify the section that needs to be addressed based on the issue description. The issue points out that the current logic for handling two-digit years is not compliant with RFC 7231, which states that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\n\nThe relevant part of the code is:\n\n```python\nif year < 100:\n    if year < 70:\n        year += 2000\n    else:\n        year += 1900\n```\n\nThis code hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years, assuming that years `0-69` map to `2000-2069` and years `70-99` map to `1970-1999`. This logic does not take into account the current year to dynamically decide the century of the two-digit year, which is the core of the issue reported.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to modify this part of the code to dynamically calculate the century of a two-digit year based on the current year, following the guideline from RFC 7231. This involves comparing the two-digit year against the last two digits of the current year and deciding the century based on whether the year appears to be more than 50 years in the future or not. \n\nNext steps will involve drafting a patch to correct this logic, ensuring that the `parse_http_date` method becomes compliant with RFC 7231 regarding the handling of two-digit years."
