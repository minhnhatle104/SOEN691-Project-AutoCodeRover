    # If the year is more than 50 years in the future, it is interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits
    if year > current_year_last_two:
        if (year - current_year_last_two) > 50:
            year += 1900
        else:
            year += 2000
    else:
        if (current_year_last_two - year) < 50:

This modification updates the logic for handling two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` method to comply with RFC 7231. It dynamically calculates the century for a two-digit year based on the current year, ensuring that a year appearing to be more than 50 years in the future is interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.
