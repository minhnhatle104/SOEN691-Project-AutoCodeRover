Understanding the feedback and the need for accuracy in addressing the issue with two-digit years in compliance with RFC 7231, let's attempt a different approach. The goal is to ensure that the logic for interpreting two-digit years dynamically adjusts based on the current year, correctly handling the interpretation of years that appear to be more than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.

Given the constraints and the need for a correct implementation, let's revise the patch with a focus on accurately calculating the century for two-digit years, ensuring it adheres closely to the specifications.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/utils/http.py</file>
<original>if year < 100:
    if year < 70:
        year += 2000
    else:
        year += 1900</original>
<patched>if year < 100:
    # Get the current year to determine the correct century for two-digit years
    current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
    # Calculate the century prefix (e.g., 19 for 1999, 20 for 2005)
    century = current_year - (current_year % 100)
    # Determine if the two-digit year should be in the past century
    if current_year % 100 - year > 50:
        century -= 100
    # For years within 50 years of the current year, adjust to the current century
    elif year - current_year % 100 > 50:
        century += 100
    year += century</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a more nuanced approach to determining the correct century for a two-digit year. It first calculates the current century's prefix and then decides whether the year should be adjusted to the previous or next century based on its proximity to the current year. This method ensures that the interpretation of two-digit years dynamically adjusts in accordance with the current date, adhering to the specifications outlined in RFC 7231.
