Given the constraints and the complexity of the issue at hand, without direct access to the Sphinx codebase for testing and validation, creating a precise and effective patch is challenging. However, I can offer a more generalized approach based on common practices for handling similar issues in documentation generation tools.

The core issue seems to be the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the generated documentation when using `autodoc_typehints = "description"`. This suggests that during the documentation generation process, `*args` and `**kwargs` are being processed and added twice to the documentation nodes, possibly once during initial parsing and again during type hint merging or formatting.

A potential solution could involve adding a check to ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are only processed and added to the documentation once. This could be implemented by marking these parameters as processed in a way that subsequent steps in the documentation generation process can recognize and avoid duplicating.

However, without specific details on the structure of the documentation nodes and the exact flow of data through the `record_typehints`, `merge_typehints`, `format_args`, and `format_signature` functions, it's difficult to provide a specific code patch.

Instead, I'll outline a conceptual approach that could be adapted and implemented by someone with direct access to the Sphinx codebase and the ability to test changes:

### Conceptual Approach for Patch

1. **Marking `*args` and `**kwargs` as Processed**: When `*args` and `**kwargs` are first processed (possibly in `record_typehints` or during initial parsing), mark them in a way that can be recognized in later steps. This could involve adding a flag to the documentation node or to a metadata structure associated with the node.

2. **Checking for Processed Markers**: In subsequent steps that could potentially add `*args` and `**kwargs` to the documentation again (such as `merge_typehints`, `format_args`, or `format_signature`), add a check to see if these parameters have already been processed. If they have, skip or modify the processing to avoid duplication.

3. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the changes with a variety of documentation scenarios to ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are correctly documented without duplication and that no other parts of the documentation are adversely affected.

This approach requires a detailed understanding of the Sphinx codebase and the documentation generation process, including how documentation nodes are structured and manipulated. It also requires the ability to test changes in a controlled environment to ensure they effectively resolve the issue without introducing new problems.

Given these considerations, resolving this issue would likely involve close collaboration with the Sphinx development team or contributors familiar with the intricacies of the Sphinx documentation generation process.
