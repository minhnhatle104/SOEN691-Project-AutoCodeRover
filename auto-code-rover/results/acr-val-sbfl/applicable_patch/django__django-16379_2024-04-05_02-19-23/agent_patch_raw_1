These modifications address the race condition by handling the `FileNotFoundError` exception gracefully in both the `has_key` and `_is_expired` methods. This approach ensures that if the file is deleted between the check and the attempt to open it, or during the deletion process in `_is_expired`, the system will handle the situation gracefully without crashing.
