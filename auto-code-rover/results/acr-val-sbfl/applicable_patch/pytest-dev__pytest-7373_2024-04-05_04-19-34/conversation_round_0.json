The caching key is only the string itself (see `cached_eval` in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`). However, the evaluation also depends on the item's globals, so the caching can lead to incorrect results. Example:\n```py\n# test_module_1.py\nimport pytest\nskip = True\n@pytest.mark.skipif(\"skip\")\ndef test_should_skip():\nassert False\n```\n```py\n# test_module_2.py\nimport pytest\nskip = False\n@pytest.mark.skipif(\"skip\")\ndef test_should_not_skip():\nassert False\n```\nRunning `pytest test_module_1.py test_module_2.py`.\nExpected: `test_should_skip` is skipped, `test_should_not_skip` is not skipped.\nActual: both are skipped.\n---\nI think the most appropriate fix is to simply remove the caching, which I don't think is necessary really, and inline `cached_eval` into `MarkEvaluator._istrue`.\n</issue>"
