Given the feedback, let's refine our approach to address the issue more accurately. The initial attempt aimed to directly handle single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` instances in both the `as_explicit` and `_entry` methods. However, considering the failure in resolving the issue, a more precise adjustment might be needed, particularly focusing on how single-element `BlockDiagMatrix` instances are treated during the conversion process.

Upon reevaluation, it appears that the core issue might not have been directly addressed in the initial patch. The error message `TypeError: 'One' object is not subscriptable` suggests that the problem occurs when the code attempts to subscript an object that doesn't support this operation. This could happen if the `BlockDiagMatrix` is incorrectly handling its single block, especially if that block is not a regular matrix but rather a special matrix type (like `OneMatrix`) that doesn't support subscripting in the same way.

Given this insight, a more targeted approach would be to ensure that the conversion process properly handles all types of blocks within a `BlockDiagMatrix`, including special cases like `OneMatrix`. However, without specific details on the failed tests and without direct evidence of mismanagement of special matrix types in the provided code snippets, crafting a precise patch is challenging.

A hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that all elements within a `BlockDiagMatrix`, regardless of their type, are correctly converted into a format that can be handled by the `ImmutableDenseMatrix` constructor. This might involve checking the type of each block and converting it appropriately before attempting to access its elements.

Since the initial patches did not resolve the issue and without new specific insights or error messages from the failed tests, providing a new concrete patch is speculative. The correct approach would likely involve a deeper dive into how different types of matrix blocks are handled during the conversion process and ensuring that types like `OneMatrix` are correctly accounted for.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the failed tests to understand exactly how they fail and what types of blocks cause issues.
- Debugging the conversion process step by step for a `BlockDiagMatrix` with a single `OneMatrix` block to see where the process breaks down.
- Consulting documentation or source code comments related to matrix type handling in Sympy, especially for special matrix types like `OneMatrix`.

Without the ability to dynamically interact with the codebase, run tests, or receive direct feedback from the execution environment, providing a more accurate patch is not feasible in this format.
