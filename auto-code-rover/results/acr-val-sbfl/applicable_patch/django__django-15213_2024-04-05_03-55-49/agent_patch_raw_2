Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, it's clear that the approach to directly manipulate the SQL string within the `ExpressionWrapper`'s `as_sql` method, especially with hardcoded checks for boolean fields and negation, was not appropriate. A more refined approach is needed that respects Django's ORM architecture and the way it handles expressions and field types.

Upon reevaluation, a potential issue could be that the `ExpressionWrapper` does not correctly handle or propagate the `output_field` information when compiling its contained expression. This could lead to incorrect SQL generation, especially for expressions that fundamentally alter the query's logic, such as negation. However, the provided code snippet does not show an incorrect handling of `output_field` directly. Instead, the issue might be more subtle, possibly related to how the `ExpressionWrapper` interacts with the query compiler and the database connection.

Given the constraints and the goal to provide a more accurate solution, let's focus on ensuring that `ExpressionWrapper` correctly utilizes its `output_field` during SQL compilation, without making assumptions about the specific type of the field or the specifics of the SQL being generated.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
    return compiler.compile(self.expression)</original>
<patched>def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
    # Compile the contained expression using the compiler.
    sql, params = compiler.compile(self.expression)
    # Check if the output_field requires special handling, e.g., wrapping the expression.
    if hasattr(self.output_field, 'as_sql'):
        # Delegate to the output_field's as_sql if available, passing the compiled SQL.
        sql, params = self.output_field.as_sql(compiler, connection, sql, params)
    return sql, params</patched>
```

This revised patch removes the incorrect assumption about handling boolean fields and negation directly within the `ExpressionWrapper`. Instead, it introduces a check to see if the `output_field` has its own `as_sql` method, which some custom fields might implement to control how their SQL is generated. This approach allows for more flexibility and respects the abstraction layers within Django's ORM, letting fields that require special SQL handling to define their behavior.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and aims to address the issue based on the understanding that `ExpressionWrapper` might not be correctly utilizing `output_field` information during SQL compilation. Further testing and validation would be necessary to ensure compatibility with Django's ORM and that it resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
