Given the complexity of the issue and the constraints provided by the Django ORM framework, it's clear that a different approach is needed. The initial attempts focused on modifying the `as_sql` method within the `ExpressionWrapper` class, but these did not resolve the issue effectively. Given the nature of the problem — incorrect SQL generation for negated `Q` objects when wrapped in an `ExpressionWrapper` — the solution likely requires a more nuanced understanding of how Django's ORM constructs SQL queries from expressions.

Upon further reflection, it's apparent that a direct manipulation of SQL strings or altering the behavior based on the `output_field` type within the `ExpressionWrapper` is not the correct approach. Instead, the solution should ensure that the `ExpressionWrapper` correctly interprets and propagates the negation of `Q` objects through to the SQL generation phase without introducing explicit field type checks or SQL string manipulations, which could lead to brittle code and unexpected behaviors across different database backends.

Given the limitations in the provided context and the complexity of Django's ORM, a precise patch cannot be confidently proposed without a deeper investigation into related parts of the ORM, such as how `Q` objects are converted into SQL and how `ExpressionWrapper` interacts with other parts of the query compilation process.

However, a conceptual approach to address issues of this nature in Django's ORM would involve ensuring that the `ExpressionWrapper`:

1. Correctly maintains and applies any negation (`NOT`) logic present in the wrapped expression during the SQL compilation phase.
2. Properly integrates with Django's query compilation process, ensuring that modifications to the logic of the wrapped expression (such as negation) are accurately reflected in the generated SQL.

Without the ability to propose a specific code patch that addresses the issue directly, the recommended next steps would be:

1. **Review Related ORM Components**: Examine closely related parts of Django's ORM, especially those involved in query compilation and the handling of `Q` objects and their negation. This could reveal insights into how these components interact and potentially identify where the logic breaks down when `ExpressionWrapper` is involved.

2. **Engage with Django Community**: Given the complexity of the issue, engaging with the Django developer community, including mailing lists and Django's issue tracker, could provide additional insights or highlight similar issues that have been addressed in the past.

3. **Enhanced Testing**: Develop a comprehensive set of tests that cover various use cases involving `ExpressionWrapper` and negated `Q` objects. This could help identify specific conditions under which the issue manifests and guide towards a more targeted solution.

In summary, while a specific patch cannot be provided based on the current understanding and context, these conceptual approaches and next steps offer a pathway to diagnosing and potentially resolving the issue within the Django ORM framework.
