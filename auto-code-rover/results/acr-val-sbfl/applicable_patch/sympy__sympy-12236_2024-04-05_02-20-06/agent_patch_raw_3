Given the limitations and the lack of direct access to the `apart` function's implementation, creating a specific patch without more detailed information about the failure or the internal workings of the `apart` function is speculative. However, I understand the need for a concrete attempt to address the issue based on the information provided. 

Considering the nature of the issue, which involves incorrect results from the `apart` function potentially due to mishandling of polynomial division or domain issues, a speculative patch could involve ensuring that polynomial division operations consider all domain constraints and handle edge cases more gracefully. 

Since the direct cause of the issue isn't clear and we don't have specific details on the `apart` function's implementation, I'll provide a hypothetical patch aimed at improving the handling of division operations in symbolic expressions, focusing on the `dmp_exquo` function as an example. This patch would aim to add additional checks or fallbacks for cases where division might lead to incorrect simplification or representation issues.

# Hypothetical Patch

```python
<file>sympy/polys/densearith.py</file>
<original>if dmp_zero_p(r, u):
    return q
else:
    raise ExactQuotientFailed(f, g)</original>
<patched>if dmp_zero_p(r, u):
    # Ensure the quotient respects the original domain constraints
    if not K.is_Field and not dmp_zero_p(q, u):
        try:
            q = dmp_convert(q, u, K)
        except DomainError:
            raise ExactQuotientFailed(f, g, "Domain conversion failed")
    return q
else:
    raise ExactQuotientFailed(f, g)</patched>
```

This hypothetical patch introduces a check after a successful division (when the remainder is zero) to ensure that the quotient respects the original domain constraints before returning it. If the domain conversion fails (a hypothetical `DomainError`), it raises an `ExactQuotientFailed` exception with a more specific error message. This could help in cases where the issue is related to domain handling after division.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on a conceptual understanding of the potential issue. It assumes the existence of a `DomainError` exception and a `dmp_convert` function for domain conversion, which may not exist in the actual SymPy codebase. The actual implementation would require a detailed understanding of the domain handling mechanisms in SymPy and might involve different functions or methods.
