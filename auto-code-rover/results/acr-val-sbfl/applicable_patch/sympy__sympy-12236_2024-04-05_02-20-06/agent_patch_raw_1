Given the context and the issue described, it seems the problem might not be directly in the `dmp_exquo` or `exquo` methods themselves but rather in how the `apart` function interacts with these methods, especially in handling cases where the division cannot be exact due to domain constraints. However, without direct access to the `apart` function's implementation and without a clear bug identified in the provided methods, proposing a specific patch is challenging. 

A hypothetical patch could involve ensuring that the `apart` function correctly handles cases where exact division is not possible, perhaps by introducing additional checks or fallback mechanisms. However, without specific details on the failure mode beyond the incorrect output, this is speculative.

Since the issue revolves around the incorrect result from the `apart` function, a more targeted approach would involve examining how `apart` uses the results from `dmp_exquo` and `exquo`, and ensuring that domain constraints are properly considered. This might involve adjustments in the `apart` function to handle special cases or improve domain handling, but without specific code or error details for `apart`, a concrete patch cannot be provided.

For educational purposes, here's an example of how one might structure a patch if there were a hypothetical issue with error handling in `dmp_exquo`:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/polys/densearith.py</file>
<original>if dmp_zero_p(r, u):
    return q
else:
    raise ExactQuotientFailed(f, g)</original>
<patched>if dmp_zero_p(r, u):
    return q
elif some_additional_condition:  # Hypothetical condition to handle specific cases
    return handle_special_case(q, r)  # Hypothetical function to handle special cases
else:
    raise ExactQuotientFailed(f, g)</patched>
```

This example is purely illustrative and not based on a specific identified bug in the `dmp_exquo` method. It demonstrates how one might add additional logic to handle special cases if such were identified as necessary by a deeper analysis of the `apart` function's behavior and its interaction with polynomial division methods.
