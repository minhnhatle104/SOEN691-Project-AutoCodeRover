Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that without direct insight into the `apart` function's implementation or specific details on how it fails beyond the incorrect output, crafting an effective patch is speculative. The issue seems to revolve around the handling of polynomial division, particularly in cases where the division is not exact, which is a complex area involving domain considerations, polynomial degrees, and potentially the handling of symbolic variables.

However, based on the general understanding of the issue and without direct access to the problematic `apart` function or specific error messages from the failed tests, here's a conceptual approach to addressing issues in symbolic computation libraries like SymPy:

1. **Enhance Error Handling and Messaging**: Improve error handling in the division functions to provide more detailed diagnostics. This can help identify why the division is failing or producing unexpected results.

2. **Review Domain Coercion Logic**: Ensure that the logic for domain coercion (e.g., from integers to rationals) is robust and handles edge cases gracefully. This might involve reviewing and potentially enhancing the logic in both `dmp_exquo` and `exquo` methods.

3. **Add Special Case Handling**: If there are known edge cases where division behaves unexpectedly, adding explicit checks and handling for these cases can prevent incorrect results.

4. **Enhance Testing**: Add more comprehensive tests covering a wider range of inputs, especially edge cases, to ensure that any changes do not introduce regressions and that existing issues are resolved.

Without the ability to directly modify the code or run tests, I can only suggest a conceptual approach rather than a specific code patch. If there were specific areas of the code identified as problematic or if there were more detailed error messages available, it would be possible to offer a more targeted solution.
