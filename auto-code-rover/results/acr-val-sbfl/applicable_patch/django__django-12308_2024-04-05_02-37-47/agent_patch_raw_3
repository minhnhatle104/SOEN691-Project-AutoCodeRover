Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that the initial approach to directly modify the handling of all fields in `display_for_field` to accommodate `JSONField` specifically might not be the correct approach, or the implementation details were not aligned with Django's expectations for field handling in the admin.

Reflecting on the Django model field system and admin interface, a more nuanced approach might be necessary. The `display_for_field` function is designed to work generically across a wide range of field types, and introducing specific logic for `JSONField` could introduce unintended side effects or not address the core issue effectively.

However, given the constraints and the feedback that the provided patches did not resolve the issue, I will provide a conceptual solution that should be explored further:

1. **Extend the Admin Interface for Custom Display**: Instead of modifying the `display_for_field` directly, consider extending the admin interface for models containing `JSONField` to use a custom display function. This approach leverages Django's existing mechanisms for customizing admin displays without altering the core utility functions.

2. **Use a Custom Admin Method**: For models with `JSONField`, define a method in the model's admin class that correctly formats the JSON data for display. This method can then be referenced in the `list_display` or used as a `readonly_field` display function, ensuring that JSON data is always correctly serialized and presented.

3. **Implement Field Wrapping**: In scenarios where modifying the admin directly is not viable, consider wrapping the `JSONField` in a custom field type that serializes its data to JSON strings automatically. This custom field would behave like a `JSONField` in all respects but ensures that its representation is always a valid JSON string.

Given the feedback and the limitations of direct code modification responses, these conceptual solutions provide a pathway to resolving the issue within the Django framework's expected usage patterns and extension mechanisms. Further exploration and implementation of these concepts would be necessary to develop a working solution.
