Given the situation and the need to address the issue with a more focused approach, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem or in the proposed solution. Since the original implementation in the `_print_tuple` method already correctly formats single-element tuples with a comma, and a direct modification to this logic did not resolve the issue, we must consider alternative approaches or deeper issues that were not addressed by the initial analysis.

However, based on the information provided and the constraints of the current context, creating a specific patch without additional insights into the failure modes or the broader context in which the `_print_tuple` method operates is challenging. The initial analysis and the hypothetical patch were based on the assumption that the method's logic might not be correctly handling single-element tuples, but this was shown to be incorrect.

Without further specific details about the tests that failed or additional context about how the `_print_tuple` method's output is being used or processed within the larger codebase, proposing a new patch is speculative. The code provided for the `_print_tuple` method appears to correctly implement the desired behavior for single-element tuples.

Given these constraints, the best course of action would be to re-examine the issue with a broader perspective, considering other parts of the codebase that interact with the `_print_tuple` method's output or further analyzing the test failures to identify specific conditions or scenarios that lead to incorrect behavior. This could involve looking into how the lambdify function processes the output of `_print_tuple` or investigating if changes in other parts of the SymPy codebase in version 1.10 could affect the behavior observed.

Without additional actionable information or the ability to conduct a broader analysis, providing a new patch is not feasible under the current constraints. Further investigation and more detailed insights into the issue are required to identify the root cause and develop an effective solution.
