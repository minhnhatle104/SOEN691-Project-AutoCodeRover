Given the analysis and the information provided, it appears there was a misunderstanding regarding the identification of a bug within the `_print_tuple` method. The method's implementation correctly handles single-element tuples by including a comma, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. Therefore, based on the code snippets and the analysis provided, there does not seem to be a need for a patch related to the handling of single-element tuples in the `sympy/printing/str.py` file.

The issue reported might stem from a misunderstanding or an external factor not directly related to the `_print_tuple` or `_print_Tuple` methods' implementations. Since the provided code snippets correctly implement the expected behavior for single-element tuples, no modification is necessary for these methods.

However, to ensure clarity and to address the initial request, here's a hypothetical patch format that would have been used if a modification were needed. This is for illustrative purposes only and does not apply to the current situation, as no bug was identified in the provided method implementations.

# Hypothetical modification (not required based on analysis)
```python
<file>sympy/printing/str.py</file>
<original>
def _print_tuple(self, expr):
    if len(expr) == 1:
        return "(%s,)" % self._print(expr[0])
    else:
        return "(%s)" % self.stringify(expr, ", ")
</original>
<patched>
# No changes required as the original implementation correctly handles single-element tuples.
</patched>
```

In conclusion, based on the detailed analysis of the `_print_tuple` and `_print_Tuple` methods, there is no identified bug that necessitates a patch. The methods as implemented correctly address the formatting of single-element tuples.
