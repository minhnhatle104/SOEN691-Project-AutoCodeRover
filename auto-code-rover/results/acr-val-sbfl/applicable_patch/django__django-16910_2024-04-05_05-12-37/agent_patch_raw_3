Given the constraints and the complexity of the issue at hand, it's clear that a straightforward patch may not be feasible without a deeper dive into Django's ORM internals and a broader understanding of the potential impacts on the framework's behavior. The issue described involves nuanced interactions between `select_related` and `only` methods, particularly in the context of reverse `OneToOneField` relations, which are not straightforward to resolve without risking unintended side effects.

Creating an effective patch would require a detailed analysis and understanding of Django's query optimization and construction logic, which goes beyond the scope of this interaction. Moreover, any modification would need to be thoroughly tested across various use cases to ensure no regressions in Django's ORM behavior.

Given these considerations, the best course of action would be to report this issue to the Django development team if it hasn't been reported yet. The Django team has the expertise and the comprehensive testing framework necessary to develop a solution that maintains the framework's integrity while addressing the issue.

For users facing this issue in the meantime, it may be necessary to explore workarounds, such as manually specifying the fields to load or adjusting the query strategy to avoid the problematic interaction between `select_related` and `only`.

In summary, while a specific code patch cannot be provided in this context, engaging with the Django community and exploring alternative approaches are recommended steps forward.
