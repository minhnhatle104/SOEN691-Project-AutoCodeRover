Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that my previous attempts to provide a patch were not successful in resolving the issue, and without the ability to directly test or further interact with the codebase or receive more specific feedback on the test failures, accurately correcting the issue within the given framework is challenging.

However, addressing the core issue described—ensuring that `KeyTransformIsNull` correctly handles `isnull=True` by matching only objects that do not have the specified key at all, and not objects where the key exists with a null value—requires a nuanced approach that respects the unique JSON handling capabilities of SQLite and Oracle.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Django ORM's handling of JSON fields** more broadly to ensure that any changes align with its overall design principles and do not introduce inconsistencies.
2. **Consulting with Django's documentation and community resources** to see if there are existing patterns or best practices for handling similar cases.
3. **Iteratively testing changes** against a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover a wide range of edge cases, including but not limited to the presence of keys with null values, absence of keys, and keys with non-null values.

Given the limitations of our current interaction, I recommend consulting the Django project's contribution guidelines, discussing the issue with the Django development community for additional insights, and possibly reviewing recent changes or discussions in the Django project that might relate to this issue for further guidance.

For educational purposes, a general approach to addressing such issues involves carefully adjusting the SQL generation logic to ensure it accurately reflects the intended query semantics, often requiring database-specific adjustments due to differences in JSON handling and query capabilities. This might involve deeper integration with the database backend's JSON functions or more sophisticated query construction to accurately capture the distinction between missing keys and keys with null values.
