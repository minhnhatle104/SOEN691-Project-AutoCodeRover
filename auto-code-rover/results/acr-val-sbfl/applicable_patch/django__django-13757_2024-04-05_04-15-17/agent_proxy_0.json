            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to focus on how the `KeyTransformIsNull` class handles the `isnull=True` condition, specifically for SQLite and Oracle databases, as the behavior deviates from the expected outcome. The external analysis tool has already pointed out a suspicious method in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` within the `KeyTransformIsNull` class that could be directly related to the issue. Given this, our primary focus should be on understanding the implementation details of the `KeyTransformIsNull` class and its `as_sqlite` method, as well as any related logic that might influence the behavior for SQLite and Oracle databases.\n\nLet's proceed with the following search API calls to gather the necessary context and code snippets:\n\n1. `search_class(\"KeyTransformIsNull\")`: This will help us locate the `KeyTransformIsNull` class in the codebase and understand its structure and inheritance.\n\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"as_sqlite\", \"django/db/models/fields/json.py\")`: Since the external tool specifically flagged the `as_sqlite` method in the `KeyTransformIsNull` class, this call will provide us with the implementation details of this method, which is crucial for addressing the issue.\n\nThese two API calls should give us a good starting point to understand the problem and begin formulating a patch."
