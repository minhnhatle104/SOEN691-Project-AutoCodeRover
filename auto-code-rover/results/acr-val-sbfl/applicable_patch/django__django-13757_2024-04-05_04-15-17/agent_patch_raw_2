Given the feedback and the need to revise the approach, let's refine the patch to ensure it correctly addresses the issue without causing test failures. The goal remains to modify the `as_sqlite` and `as_oracle` methods in the `KeyTransformIsNull` class to properly handle `isnull=True` by distinguishing between missing keys and keys with null values.

Upon reevaluation, it seems the initial approach might have been overly complex or incorrect in its SQL logic. Let's simplify and correct the logic to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

<original>    def as_sqlite(self, compiler, connection):
        if not self.rhs:
            return HasKey(self.lhs.lhs, self.lhs.key_name).as_sqlite(compiler, connection)
        return super().as_sql(compiler, connection)
</original>
<patched>    def as_sqlite(self, compiler, connection):
        if not self.rhs:
            # Corrected approach to exclude keys that are present but set to null
            template = "JSON_TYPE(%s, %%s) IS NULL OR JSON_TYPE(%s, %%s) NOT IN ('null', 'true', 'false', 'number', 'string', 'array', 'object')"
            lhs, params = self.process_lhs(compiler, connection)
            path = '$.' + self.lhs.key_name
            return template % (lhs, lhs), (path, path)
        return super().as_sql(compiler, connection)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/json.py</file>
<original>    def as_oracle(self, compiler, connection):
        if not self.rhs:
            return HasKey(self.lhs.lhs, self.lhs.key_name).as_oracle(compiler, connection)
        return super().as_sql(compiler, connection)
</original>
<patched>    def as_oracle(self, compiler, connection):
        if not self.rhs:
            # Adjusted logic for Oracle to correctly handle the isnull=True condition
            template = "NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM JSON_TABLE(%s, '$' COLUMNS (exists_path VARCHAR2(4000) PATH '$.%s'))) OR JSON_VALUE(%s, '$.%s') IS NULL"
            lhs, params = self.process_lhs(compiler, connection)
            path = self.lhs.key_name
            return template % (lhs, path, lhs, path), params + params
        return super().as_sql(compiler, connection)
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to correct the initial approach by simplifying the SQL logic and ensuring it accurately targets the issue described. For SQLite, the patch now uses `JSON_TYPE` to check for the absence of the key or its null value explicitly. For Oracle, the revised approach uses `JSON_TABLE` and `JSON_VALUE` functions to distinguish between missing keys and keys with null values, aligning with the expected behavior.
