Based on the analysis and the provided code snippets, the issue seems to stem from how the `ModelMultipleChoiceField`'s `clean` method handles empty submissions, particularly in conjunction with querysets that have been combined using `union`. The `clean` method returns `self.queryset.none()` when not required and the value is empty, which should correctly return an empty queryset. However, the issue described suggests that when the queryset is a result of a `union`, this expectation is not met.

To address this, we need to ensure that the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` correctly handles empty submissions without inadvertently treating them as a submission of all items in the queryset. However, based on the provided context, the code does not directly show a malfunction in handling the empty queryset. The issue might be more nuanced, possibly related to how querysets resulting from `union` operations are interpreted elsewhere in Django's form or model handling code.

Given the constraints and the focus on the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and `union` method, a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without a deeper understanding of the underlying cause of the issue. The code snippets provided do not exhibit an obvious bug that could be patched to resolve the described behavior. 

A hypothetical patch would involve ensuring that the `union` operation or the handling of the `none()` queryset in forms correctly interprets empty querysets as truly empty, but without a clear bug in the provided snippets, suggesting a specific code change would be speculative.

For a real-world resolution, one would likely need to debug further into how Django processes the form submission, especially looking into:
- How the queryset resulting from a `union` operation is handled through the form submission and validation process.
- Whether the `ModelMultipleChoiceField`'s handling of empty values in conjunction with `union` querysets needs adjustment.

Developers facing similar issues would need to engage with the Django project's issue tracker, providing detailed information about the behavior and, if possible, a minimal reproducible example. This could lead to a more targeted investigation by the Django development team or community, potentially resulting in a patch or workaround being identified.
