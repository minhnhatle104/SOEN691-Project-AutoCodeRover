Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears that a direct patch to the provided code snippets may not address the underlying problem, especially without clear evidence of a bug in those snippets and considering the speculative nature of any changes. The issue seems to stem from a deeper interaction within Django's ORM and form handling systems, particularly with how combined querysets from `union` operations are treated upon form submission.

However, understanding the importance of providing a solution, another approach could be to ensure that the form's clean method explicitly handles empty submissions in a way that prevents the unintended addition of all objects matching the queryset. This approach focuses on enhancing the validation to avoid misinterpretation of empty submissions rather than altering the behavior of `union` or `none`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>elif not self.required and not value:
            return self.queryset.none()</original>
<patched>elif not self.required and not value:
            # Explicitly handle empty submissions to prevent unintended additions
            # This approach focuses on enhancing validation and clarity
            return self.queryset.filter(pk__in=[])</patched>
```

This patch modifies the handling of empty submissions for `ModelMultipleChoiceField` by explicitly returning a queryset filtered by an empty list of primary keys. This method ensures that the queryset is indeed empty and avoids any potential misinterpretation or side effects caused by the `none()` method after a `union` operation. 

**Important Note**: This solution is a workaround that addresses the symptom of the issue rather than the root cause, which seems to involve complex interactions within Django's ORM and form systems. It's crucial to test this change thoroughly in the context of the application to ensure it does not introduce any unintended behavior. Additionally, reporting this issue to the Django development team or community, with a detailed description and any findings from debugging, could lead to a more comprehensive solution or reveal more about the underlying cause.
