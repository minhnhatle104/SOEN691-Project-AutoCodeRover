Given the complexity of the issue and the analysis provided, creating a direct patch without a clear indication of a bug in the provided snippets is challenging. However, I'll attempt to provide a speculative patch based on the understanding that the issue might involve the handling of empty querysets resulting from `union` operations in `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>elif not self.required and not value:
            return self.queryset.none()</original>
<patched>elif not self.required and not value:
            # Ensure that an empty queryset is treated as truly empty
            # This is a speculative fix and should be tested thoroughly
            empty_qs = self.queryset.none()
            if hasattr(empty_qs, 'union'):
                # Attempt to explicitly mark the queryset as empty
                return empty_qs.model.objects.none()
            return empty_qs</patched>
```

This patch is speculative and aims to address the issue by ensuring that when the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` attempts to return an empty queryset (`self.queryset.none()`), it explicitly returns a new empty queryset from the model's manager if the queryset supports `union` operations. This is under the assumption that the `union` operation might affect the behavior of `none()` in some contexts, which is not clearly indicated by the provided code snippets. 

**Important Note**: This patch is based on speculation and a hypothetical understanding of the issue. It should be thoroughly tested in a development environment to ensure it does not introduce unintended side effects. Additionally, engaging with the Django community through issue trackers or forums might provide further insights or alternative solutions.
