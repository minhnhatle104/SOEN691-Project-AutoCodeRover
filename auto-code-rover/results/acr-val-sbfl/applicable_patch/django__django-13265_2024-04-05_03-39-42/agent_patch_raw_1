Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential solution involves ensuring that the `_order` field is properly handled when `order_with_respect_to` is used, especially before indexes that include the `_order` field are added. The patch would need to ensure that the `_order` field is created or recognized as existing in the model before any operations that reference it, such as adding indexes, are performed.

However, based on the provided code snippets and the analysis, it's clear that the issue arises due to the order of operations in migrations, particularly how `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is handled in relation to index creation. The solution would likely involve adjusting the migration generation logic to ensure the `_order` field is accounted for appropriately.

Since the exact cause and solution are not directly evident from the provided snippets and would require a deeper understanding of Django's internals and possibly changes in multiple places, a hypothetical patch might look like this:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/autodetector.py</file>
<original>if order_with_respect_to:
    self.add_operation(
        app_label,
        operations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
            name=model_name,
            order_with_respect_to=order_with_respect_to,
        ),
        dependencies=[
            (app_label, model_name, order_with_respect_to, True),
            (app_label, model_name, None, True),
        ]
    )</original>
<patched># Ensure _order field creation is accounted for before adding indexes
if order_with_respect_to:
    # Add a preliminary operation to ensure _order field exists
    self.add_operation(
        app_label,
        operations.AddField(
            model_name=model_name,
            name='_order',
            field=models.IntegerField(default=0),
        ),
        dependencies=[
            (app_label, model_name, None, True),
        ],
    )
    self.add_operation(
        app_label,
        operations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(
            name=model_name,
            order_with_respect_to=order_with_respect_to,
        ),
        dependencies=[
            (app_label, model_name, '_order', True),
            (app_label, model_name, order_with_respect_to, True),
            (app_label, model_name, None, True),
        ]
    )</patched>
```

This modification is hypothetical and aims to illustrate how one might approach ensuring the `_order` field is handled before index creation. In reality, modifying Django's migration system would require careful consideration of existing migrations, backward compatibility, and extensive testing.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and intended for illustrative purposes. Applying changes to Django's core should only be done with a thorough understanding of the framework, comprehensive testing, and ideally, discussion with the Django development community.
