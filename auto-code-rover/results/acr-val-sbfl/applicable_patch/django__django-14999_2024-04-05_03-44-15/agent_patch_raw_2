Given the feedback and the need to revise the approach, let's consider a different angle for the patch. The initial attempt aimed to directly address the operation based on the model's `db_table` attribute. However, considering the failure in tests, it might be more appropriate to refine the conditions under which the `alter_db_table` method decides to proceed with renaming the table, ensuring it aligns more closely with the intended behavior without introducing regressions.

            (self.connection.features.ignores_table_name_case and

        # This includes when the db_table is explicitly defined and matches the new_db_table,
        # and when the old and new table names are the same (accounting for case sensitivity based on backend).
        if model._meta.db_table and model._meta.original_attrs.get('db_table') == new_db_table:
            # If the db_table is explicitly set to the new_db_table, treat as noop.
            return
        if (old_db_table == new_db_table or
            (self.connection.features.ignores_table_name_case and

```

This revised patch introduces a more nuanced check at the beginning of the `alter_db_table` method. It specifically looks for cases where the `db_table` is explicitly defined in the model's meta options (`model._meta.original_attrs.get('db_table')`) and matches the `new_db_table`. This approach aims to more accurately identify scenarios where the rename operation should indeed be a noop, based on the explicit configuration of the model, while also preserving the existing checks for table name equality (including case sensitivity considerations based on the database backend). This should address the issue without causing the previously observed test failures.
