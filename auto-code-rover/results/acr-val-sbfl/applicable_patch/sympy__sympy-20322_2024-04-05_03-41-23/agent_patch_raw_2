Given the complexity of the issue and without identifying a specific bug in the provided code snippets, it's challenging to propose a direct patch that would resolve the issue without potentially introducing other issues or not addressing the root cause. The inconsistency described seems to stem from a deeper logic handling within the SymPy library, particularly how expressions are simplified and evaluated with the `evaluate=False` parameter.

However, based on the information provided and without direct access to more detailed logs, codebase history, or the ability to run tests, I'll provide a speculative approach that might guide towards a solution. This approach involves ensuring that the simplification process respects the `evaluate` parameter consistently, especially for functions like `ceiling`.

Given the speculative nature of this task and the limitations mentioned, here's an illustrative attempt to address potential areas in the simplification logic:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/mul.py</file>
<original>if is_rational:
    if d is S.One:
        return True</original>
<patched># Ensure that the evaluation respects the 'evaluate' parameter, if applicable
# This is a speculative patch and might not directly correspond to an existing issue
if is_rational and self.evaluate:
    if d is S.One:
        return True</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/core/mul.py</file>
<original>if sign == 1 and saw_NON is False and saw_NOT is False:
    return True
if sign < 0:
    return False</original>
<patched># Speculatively adjusting the logic to account for 'evaluate' parameter
# This change is illustrative and may not align with actual library structure or variable availability
if self.evaluate:
    if sign == 1 and saw_NON is False and saw_NOT is False:
        return True
    if sign < 0:
        return False</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/printing/str.py</file>
<original>if not b:
    return sign + '*'.join(a_str)
elif len(b) == 1:
    return sign + '*'.join(a_str) + "/" + b_str[0]
else:
    return sign + '*'.join(a_str) + "/(%s)" % '*'.join(b_str)</original>
<patched># Adding a speculative check to ensure 'evaluate' parameter is considered
# Note: This patch assumes the existence of a context or flag that tracks the 'evaluate' state
if self.evaluate_context.get('evaluate', True):
    if not b:
        return sign + '*'.join(a_str)
    elif len(b) == 1:
        return sign + '*'.join(a_str) + "/" + b_str[0]
    else:
        return sign + '*'.join(a_str) + "/(%s)" % '*'.join(b_str)</patched>
```

These modifications are speculative and based on the assumption that there's a mechanism to track the `evaluate` state across these methods, which might not be the case in the actual SymPy codebase. The real solution would likely require a thorough investigation into how the `evaluate` parameter influences the parsing, simplification, and printing of expressions, and ensuring that this influence is consistently applied across the library.
