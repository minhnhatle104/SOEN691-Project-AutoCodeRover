Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems that the inconsistency arises due to the way `Mul` expressions are simplified and printed, especially when the `evaluate` parameter is involved. However, without a clear bug or misbehavior identified in the provided code snippets, proposing a specific patch is challenging. The issue might not lie directly within the methods `_eval_is_integer`, `_eval_pos_neg`, or `_print_Mul` but rather in how the `evaluate` parameter is handled across these methods or how `ceiling` function expressions are simplified.

A hypothetical patch might involve ensuring that the `evaluate` parameter's effect is consistent across different versions and operations. However, without pinpointing a specific erroneous behavior or a clear understanding of the intended behavior changes between versions, suggesting a concrete patch is speculative. 

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue would likely involve:
1. Adding unit tests to capture the expected behavior of `sympify` and `simplify` with `ceiling` expressions, specifically testing with both `evaluate=True` and `evaluate=False`.
2. Debugging the simplification process to understand how `evaluate` influences the outcome and identifying where the behavior diverges between versions.
3. Reviewing commit history and discussions between versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2 to understand the rationale behind any changes affecting this behavior.

Given these constraints, below is a speculative approach to ensure consistent handling of the `evaluate` parameter in the simplification process, specifically within the `_print_Mul` method. This is purely illustrative and may not directly address the reported issue without further investigation.

```python
<file>sympy/printing/str.py</file>
<original>if args[0] is S.One or any(isinstance(arg, Number) for arg in args[1:]):
    factors = [self.parenthesize(a, prec, strict=False) for a in args]
    return '*'.join(factors)</original>
<patched># Added check to ensure consistent handling of evaluate parameter
if not self.evaluate and (args[0] is S.One or any(isinstance(arg, Number) for arg in args[1:])):
    factors = [self.parenthesize(a, prec, strict=False) for a in args]
    return '*'.join(factors)</patched>
```

This modification assumes the existence of an `evaluate` attribute or parameter in the `StrPrinter` class that mirrors the behavior of the `evaluate` parameter in `sympify`. The actual solution would likely require a more comprehensive approach, including modifications in how expressions are simplified and ensuring that the `evaluate` parameter is consistently applied throughout the process.
