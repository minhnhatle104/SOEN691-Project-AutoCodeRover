This patch modifies the `_blockmul` method in the `BlockMatrix` class to handle the multiplication of block matrices more explicitly. When the result of multiplying two blocks is zero, it ensures that a `ZeroMatrix` with the appropriate dimensions is used instead of the scalar `Zero`. This approach should prevent the `AttributeError` when attempting to access matrix properties on a `Zero` object.
