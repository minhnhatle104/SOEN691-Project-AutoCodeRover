Given the constraints and the feedback, let's attempt a different approach for the patch, focusing on ensuring that the multiplication operation correctly handles instances where a `ZeroMatrix` should be produced, directly within the `_blockmul` method. This approach will aim to directly address the conversion of `Zero` to `ZeroMatrix` within the context of block matrix multiplication.

```python
<file>sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py</file>
<original>    def _blockmul(self, other):
        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and
                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):
            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)

        return self * other</original>
<patched>    def _blockmul(self, other):
        from sympy.matrices.expressions import ZeroMatrix
        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and
                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):
            new_blocks = []
            for i in range(self.blockshape[0]):
                row = []
                for j in range(other.blockshape[1]):
                    sum_block = sum(self.blocks[i, k] * other.blocks[k, j] for k in range(self.blockshape[1]))
                    if isinstance(sum_block, Zero):
                        sum_block = ZeroMatrix(self.blocks[i, 0].rows, other.blocks[0, j].cols)
                    row.append(sum_block)
                new_blocks.append(row)
            return BlockMatrix(new_blocks)

        return self * other</patched>
```

This revised patch explicitly checks for instances of `Zero` resulting from the block multiplication and converts them into `ZeroMatrix` with the appropriate dimensions. This approach aims to directly address the issue where a `Zero` object is incorrectly used in place of a `ZeroMatrix`, leading to the `AttributeError` when matrix-specific attributes are accessed.
