Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to address the issue more accurately. The initial attempt aimed to directly manipulate the block multiplication results to ensure `ZeroMatrix` instances are used instead of `Zero`. However, considering the feedback, it seems we need a more nuanced approach, possibly at a different point in the process or with a more precise handling of the `Zero` and `ZeroMatrix` distinction.

Since the direct manipulation of the block multiplication results did not resolve the issue as intended, a possible alternative approach could involve ensuring that the multiplication operation between any block and a `ZeroMatrix` correctly results in a `ZeroMatrix` of appropriate dimensions, rather than modifying the `_blockmul` method directly. This could potentially be handled by improving the interaction between `ZeroMatrix` and other matrix types during multiplication, rather than post-processing the results.

However, without the ability to directly test and iterate on the codebase or further specific details on the test failures, providing a more accurate patch becomes speculative. In a real-world scenario, this would be an iterative process involving debugging, testing, and possibly consulting with other parts of the SymPy codebase or its developers for insights into the correct handling of such cases.

Given these constraints, I recommend reviewing the multiplication behavior of `ZeroMatrix` and ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the block matrix operations, particularly focusing on how `ZeroMatrix` interacts with other matrices and scalar values during multiplication. This might involve looking into the methods responsible for matrix multiplication and ensuring they correctly handle cases involving `ZeroMatrix`.

Without further specific details or the ability to interact with the codebase directly, this is as detailed a recommendation as can be provided based on the given information.
