After reevaluating the issue and considering the complexity of the pretty printing functionality for the Sum expression and the alignment problem between the summand and additional terms, it's clear that a different approach is needed. The misalignment issue seems to stem from how the sum symbol, the summand (e.g., `x`), and additional terms (e.g., `+ 3`) are combined and how their alignment is calculated. The initial patch attempt focused on adjusting the baseline calculation, which was not the right approach.

Upon further inspection of the provided code snippet and the issue description, it appears that the problem might be related to how the additional terms are handled in relation to the sum symbol and the summand. The code responsible for rendering the sum expression and additional terms does not seem to properly align these elements when combining them.

Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations of the provided code snippet and information, it's challenging to propose a precise patch without a deeper understanding of the entire pretty printing system and how it handles different mathematical expressions. The alignment issue might require a more comprehensive review of the pretty printing system, including how it handles whitespace, line breaks, and the relative positioning of mathematical symbols and expressions.

To properly address this issue, it would be beneficial to:

1. Conduct a thorough review of the pretty printing system's handling of complex mathematical expressions, focusing on the alignment of symbols and terms.
2. Investigate how additional terms are appended to the sum expression and explore ways to ensure their proper alignment, possibly by adjusting the handling of whitespace and line breaks.
3. Consider implementing a more flexible system for aligning mathematical expressions, taking into account the varying widths and heights of symbols and terms.

Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations of the provided information, it's challenging to provide a specific patch that would resolve the issue without a deeper understanding of the entire pretty printing system and its handling of mathematical expressions.
