```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2</original>
<patched>prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2 - 1 if prettyF.height() % 2 == 0 else max_upper + sign_height//2</patched>
```

Explanation:
The issue with the alignment of `x` and `+ 3` in the pretty print of a Sum expression seems to stem from how the baseline for the final formatted expression (`prettyF`) is calculated. The original calculation does not account for the possibility that the height of the expression to be printed (`prettyF.height()`) might be an even number, which can lead to misalignment when trying to center the expression relative to the sum symbol. The patched code adjusts the baseline calculation to account for this scenario by checking if `prettyF.height()` is even and, if so, subtracting one from the baseline adjustment. This should help in better centering the expression relative to the sum symbol, thereby fixing the alignment issue with `x` and `+ 3`.
