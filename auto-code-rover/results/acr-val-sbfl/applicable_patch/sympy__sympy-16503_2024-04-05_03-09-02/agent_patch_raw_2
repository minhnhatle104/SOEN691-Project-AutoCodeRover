Given the initial attempt did not resolve the issue and considering the complexity of the pretty printing functionality, a more nuanced approach is required. The alignment problem between `x` and `+ 3` suggests that the adjustment of the baseline or the handling of additional terms in the sum expression might not be correctly accounted for. 

Upon re-examination of the provided code snippet, it seems the issue might not solely be in the calculation of the baseline but rather in how additional terms (`+ 3` in the issue description) are integrated with the sum expression. Since the initial patch did not address the problem, let's consider an alternative approach that ensures additional terms are properly aligned with the sum symbol and the variable `x`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>prettyF = prettyForm(*prettySign.right(prettyF))</original>
<patched># Adjust the addition of extra terms to ensure proper alignment
if not first:
    # Calculate the required padding to align the extra terms
    extra_term_padding = max(0, prettySign.width() - prettyF.width())
    padded_prettyF = stringPict(' ' * extra_term_padding) + prettyF
    prettyF = prettyForm(*prettySign.right(padded_prettyF))
else:
    prettyF = prettyForm(*prettySign.right(prettyF))</patched>
```

Explanation:
The original code always appends the sum symbol (`prettySign`) to the left of the expression (`prettyF`) without considering the width of `prettyF` relative to `prettySign`. This can lead to misalignment when `prettyF` contains additional terms that extend its width beyond that of the sum symbol. The patched code introduces a conditional check to determine if it's not the first iteration of appending symbols to `prettyF`. If it's not the first iteration (implying there are additional terms), it calculates the necessary padding to ensure that `prettyF` aligns correctly with the sum symbol. This padding is prepended to `prettyF` before appending it to the right of `prettySign`, ensuring that additional terms are properly aligned with the sum symbol and the variable `x`. This approach aims to address the alignment issue by considering the relative widths of the sum symbol and the expression, including any additional terms.
