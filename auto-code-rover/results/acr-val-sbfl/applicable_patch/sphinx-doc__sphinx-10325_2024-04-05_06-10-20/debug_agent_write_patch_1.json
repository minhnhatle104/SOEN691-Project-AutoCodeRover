Please describe.**\nI have two situations:\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into how Sphinx's autodoc extension currently handles the documentation of inherited members and identifies potential areas for implementing the requested feature. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n1. **`inherited_members_option` Function**:\n   - This function is responsible for converting the `:members:` option to auto directives. It checks if the argument is `None` or `True`, returning `'object'` in those cases, otherwise, it returns the argument as is. This function doesn't currently support a list of classes to exclude but could be a starting point for modifying how inherited members are specified.\n\n2. **`filter_members` Method in `Documenter` Class**:\n   - This method filters members based on various criteria, such as privacy, special methods, and documentation status. It includes a nested function `is_filtered_inherited_member` that checks if a member is inherited from a specified superclass. This method is crucial for implementing the feature request, as it already has logic to filter members based on inheritance. Modifying this method to accept a list of classes from which members should be ignored could directly address the issue.\n\n3. **`get_object_members` Method in `ClassDocumenter` Class**:\n   - This method retrieves the members of a class. It checks if specific members are requested or if all members should be included. When the `:inherited-members:` option is used, it currently returns all members from the base classes. This behavior could be modified to filter out members from specified base classes.\n\n4. **`import_object` Method in `MethodDocumenter` Class**:\n   - This method is responsible for importing the object to be documented and distinguishing between class methods and static methods. While not directly related to the handling of inherited members, understanding how objects are imported and categorized could be useful for ensuring that the proposed changes do not interfere with the documentation of methods.\n\n5. **`format_args` Method in `MethodDocumenter` Class**:\n   - This method formats the arguments of a method for documentation. Like `import_object`, it's not directly related to inherited member handling but provides context on how method signatures are processed, which could be relevant when documenting inherited methods.\n\nTo implement the requested feature, modifications are likely needed in the `filter_members` method to support filtering out members from a list of specified base classes. Additionally, the `get_object_members` method might require adjustments to selectively include or exclude inherited members based on the new logic. The `inherited_members_option` function could also be expanded to parse and handle a list of classes more effectively.\n\nThe next steps would involve drafting patches to these methods to support the desired functionality, ensuring that the `:inherited-members:` option can accept a list of classes and properly ignore members from those classes when documenting a module or class."
