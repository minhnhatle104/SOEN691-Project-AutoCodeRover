The initial approach attempted to make the regular expression case-insensitive directly within the expression itself. However, considering the feedback, a more robust solution involves modifying both the regular expression compilation and the line matching process to ensure case insensitivity. 

In modification 1, the regular expressions for commands (`_command_re`) and the overall line type (`_type_re`) are converted to case-insensitive by applying `.casefold()` to the strings before compiling them. This method ensures that the regular expressions themselves are case-insensitive.

In modification 2, the line being matched is converted to lowercase using `.casefold()` before the matching process. This ensures that the input line is in a consistent case with the regular expression, further ensuring that the case sensitivity of the input does not affect the matching process.

These modifications together ensure that commands in the QDP files are matched in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue without failing tests due to case sensitivity.
