This patch modifies the regular expression used to identify command lines in QDP files to be case-insensitive. The `(?i)` at the start of the regular expression achieves this by making the match case-insensitive, allowing commands like "read serr" or "READ SERR" to be recognized as valid commands. This change addresses the issue where QDP commands were expected to be in uppercase, aligning the behavior with QDP's case-insensitive nature.
