            "content": "Given the feedback, it seems necessary to refine the identification of the exact buggy location within the provided context. However, based on the initial analysis, the buggy location was identified accurately within the context of the provided information. The `send_robust` method in the `Signal` class, located in the `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py` file, is where the issue of not logging exceptions raised in receivers was pinpointed. This method catches exceptions from receivers but does not log them, which is the core of the reported issue.\n\nTo ensure thoroughness and in response to the feedback, I will reiterate the identified buggy location with the information already gathered:\n\n- **Buggy Location**:\n  - **File**: `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`\n  - **Class**: `Signal`\n  - **Method**: `send_robust`\n\nThis method is responsible for sending signals and robustly handling exceptions from receivers without logging them, which is the behavior that needs to be patched according to the issue description. No further context from the project seems necessary for addressing this specific issue, as the modification required is quite clear: adding logging functionality within the exception handling block of the `send_robust` method."
