To address the issue more effectively and ensure that the patch does not introduce test failures, it's crucial to integrate the logging in a way that minimally impacts the existing functionality while providing the desired logging capability. Let's refine the patch by ensuring the logging setup is done at the beginning of the file, which is a common practice, rather than within the exception handling block. This approach minimizes the changes within the `send_robust` method and ensures that logging is configured correctly for the entire module.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/dispatch/dispatcher.py</file>
<original>from django.utils import ...</original>
<patched>from django.utils import ...
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/dispatch/dispatcher.py</file>
<original>            except Exception as err:
                responses.append((receiver, err))</original>
<patched>            except Exception as err:
                # Log the exception with the receiver information
                logger.exception("Exception raised in receiver: %r", receiver)
                responses.append((receiver, err))</patched>
```

This revised approach ensures that the logging setup is done once at the module level, which is a more efficient and cleaner way to handle logging. The actual logging within the `send_robust` method is now straightforward, focusing solely on logging the exception when it occurs. This should maintain the existing functionality while adding the desired logging capability, hopefully without introducing any test failures.
