Given the constraints and the need to ensure that the patch does not introduce test failures, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the application of the patch or in the interpretation of the test failures. However, without specific details on the test failures or further context, the best course of action is to refine the proposed solution based on best practices and common patterns in Django for handling logging within its components.

Let's revise the approach to ensure that the logging is done in a way that is consistent with Django's practices, focusing on minimizing the impact on the existing codebase and ensuring that the logging does not inadvertently affect the behavior of the `send_robust` method.

Given the constraints and the feedback, here is a refined version of the patch that aims to address the issue more precisely:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/dispatch/dispatcher.py</file>
<original>import threading</original>
<patched>import threading
import logging

# Initialize logger at the module level
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the logging module is imported and a logger is initialized at the module level, following Django's convention for logging within its components.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/dispatch/dispatcher.py</file>
<original>            except Exception as err:
                responses.append((receiver, err))</original>
<patched>            except Exception as err:
                # Log the exception with the receiver information using Django's logging practices
                logger.error("Exception raised in receiver %r: %s", receiver, err, exc_info=True)
                responses.append((receiver, err))</patched>
```

In this modification, the logging call is adjusted to use `logger.error` instead of `logger.exception`, which is a subtle but important distinction. The `logger.error` method is used with `exc_info=True` to log the exception information. This approach is chosen to provide more control over the logging level and to ensure that the logging behavior is consistent with how Django logs errors in other parts of the framework.

These modifications aim to address the issue by adding logging for exceptions raised in receivers of Django signals in a manner that is consistent with Django's logging practices, without introducing changes that could affect the existing functionality or cause test failures.
