Given the feedback and the need to revise the approach while ensuring that the issue of recursion is addressed, let's consider an alternative solution. The goal remains to trigger the "xlim_changed" callback for all shared axes without causing recursion. A potential solution is to add a mechanism to track whether the "xlim_changed" event has already been processed for a set of shared axes during a single update cycle.

This approach involves adding a temporary attribute or a flag to the axes object to indicate that the "xlim_changed" event has been processed for this set of shared axes. This flag would be checked before emitting the event to prevent recursion.

        self.already_processing = any(getattr(other, '_processing_xlim_changed', False)
                                      for other in self.shared_axes.get_siblings(self.axes))
        if not self.already_processing:
            # Mark all shared axes as processing xlim_changed
            for other in self.shared_axes.get_siblings(self.axes):
                setattr(other, '_processing_xlim_changed', True)

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # Clear the processing flag on all shared axes
        if not self.already_processing:
            for other in self.shared_axes.get_siblings(self.axes):
                delattr(other, '_processing_xlim_changed')

left, right = self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=False, auto=auto)  # Avoid direct emit to prevent recursion
with _SharedXLimChangedContext(self) as ctx:
    if emit and not ctx.already_processing:
        # Now safe to emit xlim_changed without causing recursion
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
return left, right</patched>
```

This modification introduces a context manager `_SharedXLimChangedContext` to manage the state of "xlim_changed" processing across shared axes. It prevents recursion by ensuring that "xlim_changed" is only emitted once per update cycle for a set of shared axes. The `emit` parameter is temporarily set to `False` during the call to `_set_lim` to prevent immediate recursion, and the actual emission of "xlim_changed" is controlled by the context manager based on whether any of the shared axes are already processing the event. This approach ensures that the callbacks are triggered appropriately without causing infinite recursion.
