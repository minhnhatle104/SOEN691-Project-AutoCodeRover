<patched>left, right = self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)
# Trigger 'xlim_changed' for shared axes
if emit:
    for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
        if other is not self:
            other.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', other)
return left, right</patched>
```

This modification addresses the issue by ensuring that the "xlim_changed" callback is triggered for all shared axes when the `set_xlim` method is called with `emit=True`. It does this by explicitly calling the `callbacks.process` method for each sibling axis after the x-axis limits have been set. This approach avoids the recursion problem mentioned in the issue by not altering the `emit` parameter in the recursive `set_xlim` calls for sibling axes, but instead directly triggering the callback after all limit changes have been made.
