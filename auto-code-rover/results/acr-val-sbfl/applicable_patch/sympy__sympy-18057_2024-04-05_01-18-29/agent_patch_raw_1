**Explanation**:
- **Modification 1**: In the `sympify` function, before proceeding with the conversion logic, if the input `a` is a string, we attempt to safely evaluate it using `ast.literal_eval`. This function can evaluate strings containing Python literals safely but will raise an exception if the string contains anything else. This is a safer alternative to `eval` and prevents the execution of arbitrary code. If `ast.literal_eval` fails (due to `ValueError` or `SyntaxError`), we proceed with the original logic, which might still use `eval` in a controlled manner later on.
  
- **Modification 2**: In the `eval_expr` function, we attempt to use `ast.literal_eval` for evaluating the code generated by `stringify_expr`. This is a safer alternative to `eval` and is used here to prevent the execution of arbitrary code. If `ast.literal_eval` raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the code contains more than simple Python literals, we fall back to using `eval`. This fallback is necessary because `ast.literal_eval` is intentionally limited in functionality compared to `eval`.

These modifications aim to mitigate the risk of executing arbitrary code through `eval` by preferring `ast.literal_eval` where possible, which is a safer alternative. However, it's important to note that these changes might not cover all edge cases and should be thoroughly tested.
