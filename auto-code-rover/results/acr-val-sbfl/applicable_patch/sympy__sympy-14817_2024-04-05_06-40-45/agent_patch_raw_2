Given the feedback and the need to address the issue without introducing new errors, let's refine the approach. The original problem seems to stem from an incorrect handling of negative items in the `_print_MatAdd` method, specifically the misuse of `sympify` to determine if an item is negative, which is not only unnecessary but also error-prone when dealing with string representations of symbols.

A more robust solution would avoid the use of `sympify` for this purpose and instead rely on the properties of the `MatrixExpr` objects themselves to determine if an item should be printed with a leading '+' or not. Since the traceback indicates a problem with parsing, specifically with symbols ending in '*', we need to ensure that our approach does not rely on parsing symbol names as expressions.

            if s is None:
                s = pform     # First element
            else:
                if S(item.args[0]).is_negative:
                    s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' '))
                    pform = self._print(item)
                else:
                    s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' + '))
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, pform))

        return s

<patched>    def _print_MatAdd(self, expr):
        s = None
        for item in expr.args:
            pform = self._print(item)
            if s is None:
                s = pform     # First element
            else:
                # Instead of checking if the first argument is negative,
                # we check if the item itself should be considered negative.
                # This avoids parsing issues and incorrect assumptions about the item's structure.
                if hasattr(item, 'is_negative') and item.is_negative:
                    s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' '))
                else:
                    s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' + '))
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, pform))

        return s
</patched>
```

This revised patch removes the reliance on `sympify` for determining negativity, which was the root cause of the parsing error. Instead, it checks if the `item` itself has an `is_negative` property, a more direct and error-resistant method for determining how to format the output. This approach should maintain the intended functionality of pretty printing `MatAdd` expressions while avoiding the issues caused by parsing symbol names.
