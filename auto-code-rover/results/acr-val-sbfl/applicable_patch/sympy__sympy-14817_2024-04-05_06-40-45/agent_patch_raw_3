Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the initial approach to directly modify the handling of negative items in the `_print_MatAdd` method may not directly address the root cause of the issue or introduces new problems. The error seems to stem from an incorrect assumption about the structure of the items being printed, specifically when attempting to determine if an item is negative, which leads to a misuse of `sympify`.

A more appropriate solution would be to ensure that the logic for determining negativity does not rely on potentially erroneous assumptions about the item's structure or involve parsing symbol names that could lead to syntax errors. Since the direct manipulation of the printing logic did not yield the desired outcome, let's consider a different approach that focuses on ensuring the integrity and correctness of the items before they are processed by the `_print_MatAdd` method.

However, based on the constraints and the feedback that the provided patches did not resolve the issue, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem or the solution might require a deeper integration with the SymPy codebase that isn't captured in the provided context.

Without further specific details on the tests that failed or additional insights into the underlying logic of the SymPy pretty printing and sympify mechanisms, providing a more accurate patch becomes challenging. The issue might not solely reside in the handling of negative items within the `_print_MatAdd` method but could also involve how expressions and symbols are interpreted and processed throughout the pretty printing process.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the failed tests to understand the specific conditions and expressions that lead to failures.
- Consulting with the SymPy documentation or contributors to gain deeper insights into the intended behavior of pretty printing matrix expressions and the role of sympify in this process.
- Exploring alternative approaches to handling expressions within the pretty printing process that do not rely on potentially error-prone parsing or assumptions about expression structure.

Given the limitations of this interactive format, a precise patch cannot be provided without further context and exploration.
