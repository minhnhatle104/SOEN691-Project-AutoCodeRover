        "content": "Based on the collected context from the search API results, let's analyze the relevant parts of the Django codebase that could be contributing to the issue described.\n\n1. **`ModelBase.__new__` method in `django/db/models/base.py`**: This method is responsible for creating new model classes. It performs several important tasks, such as ensuring that the model class is properly set up with a meta class (`_meta`), handling abstract models, setting up fields (including inherited fields), and registering the model with the app's model registry. A key part of this process involves handling primary keys, including auto-created primary keys and inherited primary keys. Since the issue involves inherited primary keys and the warning `models.W042`, any changes or bugs in this method could potentially lead to the observed behavior.\n\n2. **`Apps.get_registered_model` method in `django/apps/registry.py`**: This method retrieves a model class from the registry based on its app label and model name. It's used in various parts of Django to ensure that operations are performed on the correct model class. While this method itself might not be directly responsible for the issue, it plays a crucial role in the model registration process, which could be affected if inherited primary keys are not handled correctly.\n\n3. **`Apps.lazy_model_operation` method in `django/apps/registry.py`**: This method allows for operations to be deferred until all specified models have been loaded and registered. This is particularly relevant for operations that depend on relationships between models, such as setting up foreign keys or inheriting fields from parent models. If there's a bug or change in how these operations are queued or executed, it could affect how primary keys are inherited.\n\n4. **`Apps.do_pending_operations` method in `django/apps/registry.py`**: This method executes any operations that have been deferred until a model is fully loaded and registered. It's the mechanism by which `lazy_model_operation`'s deferred functions are eventually executed. Any issues in this process could potentially lead to problems with model setup, including the inheritance of primary keys.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to revolve around the handling of primary keys in model inheritance, particularly in how models are constructed (`ModelBase.__new__`) and how model registration and deferred operations are managed (`Apps` class methods). The warning `models.W042` suggests that Django is not recognizing the manually specified primary key in the inherited model and is instead attempting to auto-create a primary key.\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to investigate further into how Django 3.2 alpha has changed the handling of primary keys in model inheritance, specifically looking at changes in the `ModelBase.__new__` method and the model registration process in `Apps`. It's possible that a change in Django 3.2 alpha inadvertently affected the recognition of inherited primary keys, leading to the observed warnings."
