Given the constraints and the need to accurately address the issue without causing other functionalities to fail, it appears that my previous attempts may have misunderstood the core problem or introduced changes that were either too broad or not directly addressing the root cause. Without further specific details on the test failures or additional insights into the internal workings of Pylint's file discovery and ignore mechanism, accurately crafting a patch becomes challenging.

However, based on the initial problem statement and the provided context, the issue lies in the handling of `ignore-paths` during recursive file discovery. Since direct modifications to the handling of `ignore_paths` and pattern transformation did not resolve the issue, and without the ability to further debug or test changes within this environment, I recommend a review of the Pylint's documentation and source code related to file discovery and ignore mechanisms for potential discrepancies or updates in the handling of these features.

For users facing similar issues, a potential workaround could involve manually filtering out files or directories that match the `ignore-paths` patterns before passing them to Pylint, though this approach may not be feasible for all use cases.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the test failures to understand how the proposed changes impacted the functionality.
- Engaging with the Pylint development community for insights or known issues related to `ignore-paths` handling in recursive mode.
- Incrementally testing changes locally or in a development environment to isolate the impact and ensure compatibility with existing functionalities.

Without the ability to perform these actions in this environment, I'm unable to provide further modifications to resolve the issue accurately.
