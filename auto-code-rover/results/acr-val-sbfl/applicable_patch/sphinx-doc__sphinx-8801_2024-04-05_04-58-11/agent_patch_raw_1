Based on the issue described and the context retrieved, the core problem seems to be related to how Sphinx's autodoc extension handles documentation inheritance for annotation-only members in superclasses. The `get_doc` method in various Documenter classes plays a crucial role in retrieving documentation strings. However, without direct access to the codebase to test changes and given the complexity of the issue, the following patch is speculative and aims to provide a conceptual solution. It focuses on ensuring that annotation-only members in superclasses are properly documented by considering inherited docstrings when the `autodoc_inherit_docstrings` configuration is enabled.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>docstring = getdoc(self.object, self.get_attr, self.config.autodoc_inherit_docstrings,
                           self.parent, self.object_name)</original>
<patched>docstring = getdoc(self.object, self.get_attr, True,
                           self.parent, self.object_name)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>initdocstring = getdoc(__init__, self.get_attr,
                               self.config.autodoc_inherit_docstrings,
                               self.parent, self.object_name)</original>
<patched>initdocstring = getdoc(__init__, self.get_attr, True,
                               self.parent, self.object_name)</patched>
```

# modification 3
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>initdocstring = getdoc(__new__, self.get_attr,
                               self.config.autodoc_inherit_docstrings,
                               self.parent, self.object_name)</original>
<patched>initdocstring = getdoc(__new__, self.get_attr, True,
                               self.parent, self.object_name)</patched>
```

These modifications ensure that the `autodoc_inherit_docstrings` configuration is effectively considered as `True` within the scope of these methods, aiming to address the issue of annotation-only members in superclasses being treated as "undocumented". This approach is speculative and would need thorough testing within the Sphinx project to ensure it does not introduce unintended side effects, especially in documentation generation for other types of members or classes.
