Given the context and the nature of the issue, a potential patch could involve ensuring that the SQL generated by Django's ORM explicitly handles column references in a way that avoids ambiguity, especially in "GROUP BY" clauses and when dealing with subqueries. However, without a deep dive into the entire Django ORM codebase and understanding all potential side effects, this patch should be considered as a starting point for further testing and refinement.

```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</file>
<original>    def as_subquery_condition(self, alias, columns, compiler):
        qn = compiler.quote_name_unless_alias
        qn2 = self.connection.ops.quote_name

        for index, select_col in enumerate(self.query.select):
            lhs_sql, lhs_params = self.compile(select_col)
            rhs = '%s.%s' % (qn(alias), qn2(columns[index]))
            self.query.where.add(
                RawSQL('%s = %s' % (lhs_sql, rhs), lhs_params), 'AND')

        sql, params = self.as_sql()
        return 'EXISTS (%s)' % sql, params

<patched>    def as_subquery_condition(self, alias, columns, compiler):
        qn = compiler.quote_name_unless_alias
        qn2 = self.connection.ops.quote_name

        for index, select_col in enumerate(self.query.select):
            lhs_sql, lhs_params = self.compile(select_col)
            # Ensure column references are unique to avoid ambiguity
            rhs = '%s.%s AS unique_col_%s' % (qn(alias), qn2(columns[index]), index)
            self.query.where.add(
                RawSQL('%s = %s' % (lhs_sql, rhs), lhs_params), 'AND')

        sql, params = self.as_sql()
        # Modify the GROUP BY clause to reference the unique aliases
        if 'GROUP BY' in sql:
            sql = sql.replace('GROUP BY', 'GROUP BY unique_col_')
        return 'EXISTS (%s)' % sql, params
</patched>
```

This modification attempts to address the ambiguity by ensuring that each column in the subquery condition is aliased uniquely. Additionally, it modifies the `GROUP BY` clause to reference these unique aliases. This approach might not directly solve all scenarios leading to the "column reference is ambiguous" error, but it targets the core issue of ambiguity in SQL generated by Django's ORM when handling subqueries and annotations.

Please note, this patch is hypothetical and focuses on the described issue. Applying such changes to the Django ORM requires thorough testing across various use cases to ensure it does not introduce regressions or new issues.
