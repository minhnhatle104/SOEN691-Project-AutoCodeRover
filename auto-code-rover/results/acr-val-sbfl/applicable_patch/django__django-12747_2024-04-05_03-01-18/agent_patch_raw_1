```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>deleted, _rows_count = collector.delete()</original>
<patched>deleted, _rows_count = collector.delete()
# Ensure consistency in _rows_count when no objects are deleted
if deleted == 0:
    model_labels = set(self.model._meta.label for self in del_query)
    _rows_count = {label: 0 for label in model_labels}</patched>
```

This patch addresses the inconsistency in the result format of the `QuerySet.delete` method when zero objects are deleted. By ensuring that `_rows_count` contains an entry for the model with a count of 0 when no objects are deleted, the result format becomes consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. This change aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue.
