Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to ensure consistency in the `_rows_count` dictionary without introducing errors in other parts of the system. The goal is to make sure that `_rows_count` behaves consistently for models with and without foreign keys when no objects are deleted. A more careful approach would be to adjust how `_rows_count` is populated in the `Collector.delete` method, ensuring it includes all models involved in the query, even if their delete count is zero. This approach minimizes the risk of side effects in other parts of the Django framework.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>deleted, _rows_count = collector.delete()</original>
<patched># Patch to ensure consistency in _rows_count for zero deletions
deleted, _rows_count = collector.delete()
# Normalize _rows_count to include all models in the queryset with zero deletions
all_models = {model._meta.label: 0 for model in collector.data.keys()}
_rows_count = {**all_models, **_rows_count}</patched>
```

This revised patch aims to normalize `_rows_count` by ensuring it includes all models that were part of the deletion process, even if no records were deleted for some of them. By initializing `all_models` with a count of 0 for each model in `collector.data.keys()` (which includes all models considered during the collection phase) and then merging it with `_rows_count`, we ensure that the final `_rows_count` dictionary reflects a consistent state. This approach should address the inconsistency issue while minimizing the impact on other functionalities.
