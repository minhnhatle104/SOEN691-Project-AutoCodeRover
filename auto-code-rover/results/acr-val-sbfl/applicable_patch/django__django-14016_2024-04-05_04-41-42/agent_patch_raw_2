Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more accurately without introducing test failures, let's refine the approach. The goal remains to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully during the deep copy process, specifically when dealing with `Q` objects that include `dict_keys`. However, we need to ensure compatibility with all existing functionalities and tests.

The initial approach attempted to directly modify the handling of `dict_keys` during the deep copy process. A more subtle and compatible approach would involve ensuring that any non-pickleable objects are transformed into a pickleable state before the deep copy operation, without altering the core logic of deep copying and combining `Q` objects.

Given this, let's adjust the strategy to focus on preparing the `Q` object for deep copying by ensuring its contents are pickleable, without changing the deep copy logic itself. This approach minimizes the risk of introducing incompatibilities or test failures.

        if not other:
            return copy.deepcopy(self)
        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.
        elif not self:
            return copy.deepcopy(other)

        obj = type(self)()
        obj.connector = conn
        obj.add(self, conn)
        obj.add(other, conn)
        return obj
</original>
<patched>    def _combine(self, other, conn):
        if not isinstance(other, Q):
            raise TypeError(other)

        # Prepare for deepcopy by ensuring all elements are pickleable
        def make_pickleable(obj):
            if isinstance(obj, Q):
                for index, child in enumerate(obj.children):
                    if isinstance(child, tuple) and len(child) == 2:
                        key, value = child
                        if isinstance(value, dict_keys):
                            obj.children[index] = (key, list(value))
            return obj

        self = make_pickleable(self)
        other = make_pickleable(other)

        # If the other Q() is empty, ignore it and just use `self`.
        if not other:
            return copy.deepcopy(self)
        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.
        elif not self:
            return copy.deepcopy(other)

        obj = type(self)()
        obj.connector = conn
        obj.add(self, conn)
        obj.add(other, conn)
        return obj
</patched>
```

This modification focuses on pre-processing the `Q` objects before the deep copy operation in `_combine` method to ensure that all elements, specifically `dict_keys`, are in a pickleable form (e.g., converting `dict_keys` to lists). This approach avoids altering the deep copy mechanism itself, aiming for a solution that is less likely to introduce regressions or test failures.
