# modification 1
```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>prepared_request = req.copy()</original>
<patched># Update the method of the request based on the redirect response before copying
# Preserve the method change across subsequent redirects
if i > 0:  # If this is not the first redirect
    req.method = method
prepared_request = req.copy()</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>method = req.method</original>
<patched># Initially set the method to the current request's method
# This line remains unchanged, but is included for context
method = req.method

# The actual method modification based on status codes is handled correctly in the original code
# The key change is to ensure the modified method is applied to the req object before copying for the next redirect</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The core issue arises from the fact that the `req` object's method is modified based on the redirect response status code, but this modification is not preserved for subsequent redirects because `req.copy()` is called before applying the method change to the `req` object itself.
- The proposed patch ensures that if there has been at least one redirect (i.e., `i > 0`), the `req` object's method is updated to the last modified method before it is copied for the next redirect. This way, the method change induced by a `303 See Other` response, for example, is preserved across all subsequent redirects.
- The second modification is more of a clarification than a change, indicating that the method is initially set correctly and the actual logic for modifying the method based on status codes does not need to be altered. The critical change is ensuring that the `req` object reflects these modifications before being copied for the next redirect.
