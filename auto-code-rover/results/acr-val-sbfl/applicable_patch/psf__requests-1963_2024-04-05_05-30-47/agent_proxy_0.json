The external analysis tool's output, while useful, does not directly point to the methods involved in handling redirects. Therefore, we will focus on the `Session` class and methods related to redirect handling, such as `resolve_redirects`.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `Session` class and the `resolve_redirects` method within it to get more context about how redirects are currently handled:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Session\")`\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"resolve_redirects\", \"Session\")`"
