Given this information, I will perform the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")`: This will help us understand the structure of the `ManyToManyField` class, including any relevant attributes and methods that deal with the `symmetrical` argument and `related_name`.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"contribute_to_class\", \"ManyToManyField\")`: Since the `contribute_to_class` method is mentioned as suspicious, it's likely where the logic for handling `related_name` and `symmetrical` arguments is implemented or invoked. Understanding this method will be crucial.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_get_m2m_reverse_attr\", \"ManyToManyField\")`: The `_get_m2m_reverse_attr` method might contain logic related to how the reverse relationship attributes are determined, which could be relevant when dealing with symmetrical relationships.\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for understanding how `ManyToManyField` handles the `symmetrical` and `related_name` arguments and guide us in developing a patch to raise an error when a `related_name` is defined in a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `ManyToManyField` class and its methods, we can derive a few key points relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **ManyToManyField Class Structure**: The `ManyToManyField` class inherits from `RelatedField` and is defined with several attributes and methods that manage many-to-many relationships. The constructor (`__init__`) accepts various parameters including `related_name` and `symmetrical`, which are directly related to the issue.\n\n2. **contribute_to_class Method**: This method is responsible for setting up the many-to-many relationship on the class to which the field is added. It contains logic for handling symmetrical relationships, especially when the field is self-referential. Notably, it automatically sets a `related_name` for symmetrical relations to avoid clashes and ensure internal use of backward relations. However, it does not currently raise an error if a developer manually specifies a `related_name` for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`, which is the crux of the issue.\n\n3. **_get_m2m_reverse_attr Method**: This method provides the related accessor or database column name for the many-to-many table, particularly handling the reverse attribute. It iterates through fields in the through model to find the appropriate reverse attribute. While this method is crucial for managing many-to-many relationships, it does not directly contribute to the issue of preventing `related_name` in symmetrical `ManyToManyField` instances but helps understand the underlying mechanics.\n\nGiven this analysis, the focus for addressing the issue should be on modifying the `contribute_to_class` method within the `ManyToManyField` class. Specifically, we need to introduce logic that checks if a `related_name` is provided for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField` and, if so, raises an appropriate error to inform the developer that this is not supported. This approach will directly address the problem described in the issue by preventing confusion and ensuring developers are aware of the constraints around symmetrical `ManyToManyField` instances."
