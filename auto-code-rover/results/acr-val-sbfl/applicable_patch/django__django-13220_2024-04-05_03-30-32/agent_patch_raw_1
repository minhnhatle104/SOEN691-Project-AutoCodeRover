```

This patch adds an `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class to allow instances to be compared based on their content. The method first checks if the other object is an instance of `ValidationError`, returning `NotImplemented` if not. It then compares instances based on `error_dict` if both have this attribute, falling back to comparing `error_list` if both have it. If neither comparison is applicable, it compares the instances based on the `messages` property, converting the lists to sets for order-independent comparison. This approach addresses the requirement for the comparison to be independent of the order in which errors were raised.
