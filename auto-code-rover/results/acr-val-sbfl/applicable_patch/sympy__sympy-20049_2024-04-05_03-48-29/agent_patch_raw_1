This patch attempts to address the issue by adding logic to the `vel` method in the `Point` class to automatically calculate the velocity of a point if it has not been explicitly defined. This is done by iterating over all points for which the position relative to the current point is known, attempting to calculate the velocity based on the time derivative of the position vector in the specified reference frame. If this calculation is successful for any point, it sets the velocity for the current point and breaks out of the loop. If no such calculation is successful, it falls back to raising the original `ValueError`. This approach aims to provide a more intuitive behavior for users, aligning with the expectation set by the handling of angular velocities between reference frames.
