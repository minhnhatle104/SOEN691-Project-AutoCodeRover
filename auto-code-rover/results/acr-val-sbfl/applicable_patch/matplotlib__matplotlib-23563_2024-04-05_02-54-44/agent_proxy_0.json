            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `Line3D` object is used within the matplotlib library, specifically in the context of 3D plotting. The error message \"AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\" suggests that there's an issue with how the vertices (or points) that make up the line are being handled or accessed.\n\nGiven this, we should look into the `Line3D` class to understand its structure and how it's supposed to work, especially regarding the `_verts3d` attribute. Additionally, since the error occurs during the drawing phase, it would be useful to examine the `draw` method within the context of 3D plotting. This could help us identify any discrepancies or missing steps related to the `_verts3d` attribute handling.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls to gather more information:\n- `search_class(\"Line3D\")`: This will help us understand the structure of the `Line3D` class and any relevant methods or attributes, including `_verts3d`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"draw\", \"Line3D\")`: Since the error occurs during drawing, examining the `draw` method within the `Line3D` class could provide insights into how `_verts3d` is expected to be used or set up."
