Given the feedback and the need to address the issue without causing test failures, let's revise the approach to ensure that `iter_content` behaves as expected when `decode_unicode=True` is specified, without altering the behavior in scenarios that currently work correctly.

The core issue seems to be a misunderstanding or misimplementation of how `iter_content` should return unicode content when `decode_unicode=True`. The original implementation suggests that it attempts to decode content based on the response's encoding, but there might be a gap in ensuring that this happens as expected.

Upon reviewing the provided code snippets and considering the feedback, it seems the initial patch might have misunderstood the control flow or introduced changes that were too broad or incorrectly scoped. Let's focus on a more targeted adjustment that directly addresses the issue without altering the existing logic that works correctly for other scenarios.

# Revised Patch

```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>if decode_unicode:
            chunks = stream_decode_response_unicode(chunks, self)</original>
<patched>if decode_unicode:
            if self.encoding is None:
                self.encoding = 'utf-8'  # Assuming UTF-8 if encoding is not specified
            chunks = stream_decode_response_unicode(chunks, self)</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The revised patch directly addresses the issue where `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` does not return unicode content as expected. The original approach to modify both `requests/models.py` and `requests/utils.py` might have been too invasive or misaligned with the library's design, potentially leading to test failures.
- This patch ensures that if `decode_unicode` is `True` and the response's encoding has not been set (`None`), it defaults to `'utf-8'`, a common and reasonable default for web content. This change is made before calling `stream_decode_response_unicode`, ensuring that the decoding process has a specific encoding to work with.
- It's a more conservative approach, focusing on the scenario described in the issue without broadly altering the behavior of other parts of the code. This should minimize the risk of introducing regressions or failing existing tests.

This approach assumes that the primary issue is the absence of a default encoding in cases where the response's encoding is not explicitly set. By ensuring there's always an encoding to use when `decode_unicode=True`, it aims to resolve the user's issue without broader impacts on the library's functionality.
