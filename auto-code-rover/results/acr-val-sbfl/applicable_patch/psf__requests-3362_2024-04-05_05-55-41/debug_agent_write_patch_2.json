However, they observe that it returns bytes instead.\n\nGiven the context:\n- The `iter_content` method does attempt to decode content when `decode_unicode=True`, but this is contingent on the response's encoding being set. If the encoding is not determined (`None`), the `stream_decode_response_unicode` function will yield bytes as received without decoding.\n- There might be a misunderstanding or a bug related to how the response's encoding is determined or applied in the decoding process, leading to the observed behavior.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Verify how the response's encoding is determined and ensure it is correctly set for JSON documents.\n- Ensure that the decoding process in `stream_decode_response_unicode` is correctly applied when `decode_unicode=True` in `iter_content`.\n- Consider adding more explicit documentation or error handling around the encoding detection and decoding process to clarify expected behaviors and common pitfalls."

The presence of `Content-Type` and `charset` in various parts of the codebase, however, points towards the mechanism for determining and handling response encodings.\n\n### Analysis of Search Results:\n\n1. **Absence of a Direct `encoding` Method in `Response`**:\n   - This implies that encoding is likely handled through properties or indirectly through other methods. It's common for HTTP libraries to determine encoding based on the `Content-Type` header of the response, which might include a `charset` parameter specifying the encoding.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `Content-Type`**:\n   - The match in `requests/models.py` suggests that this file handles or processes the `Content-Type` header of responses. This is a likely place where the library could parse headers to determine the response's encoding.\n\n3. **Occurrences of `charset`**:\n   - With multiple matches in `requests/utils.py` and a match in `requests/models.py`, it's clear that these files are involved in encoding determination and possibly conversion. The presence in `utils.py` suggests utility functions or helpers that deal with encoding issues, which could be directly related to how `iter_content` handles `decode_unicode`.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nGiven the absence of direct methods for encoding within the `Response` class and the presence of `Content-Type` and `charset` in key files, it's reasonable to conclude that the bug might not be due to a single method or function but rather how these components interact to determine and handle encoding.\n\nThe user's issue with `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` returning bytes instead of a unicode object could stem from a few areas:\n\n- **Encoding Determination**: If the response's encoding isn't correctly determined or if the `Content-Type` header's `charset` is not properly parsed, `iter_content` might not decode the content as expected.\n- **Encoding Application**: Even if the encoding is correctly determined, the application of this encoding in `stream_decode_response_unicode` or through `iter_content` might have issues.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo further pinpoint the bug, a detailed examination of how `requests/models.py` and `requests/utils.py` handle the `Content-Type` header and `charset` to set and use the response's encoding would be necessary. Specifically, looking into how `Response` objects determine their encoding based on response headers and how this encoding is subsequently used in decoding content could reveal the source of the issue."

The original implementation suggests that it attempts to decode content based on the response's encoding, but there might be a gap in ensuring that this happens as expected.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided code snippets and considering the feedback, it seems the initial patch might have misunderstood the control flow or introduced changes that were too broad or incorrectly scoped.

The original approach to modify both `requests/models.py` and `requests/utils.py` might have been too invasive or misaligned with the library's design, potentially leading to test failures.\n- This patch ensures that if `decode_unicode` is `True` and the response's encoding has not been set (`None`), it defaults to `'utf-8'`, a common and reasonable default for web content. This change is made before calling `stream_decode_response_unicode`, ensuring that the decoding process has a specific encoding to work with.\n- It's a more conservative approach, focusing on the scenario described in the issue without broadly altering the behavior of other parts of the code. This should minimize the risk of introducing regressions or failing existing tests.\n\nThis approach assumes that the primary issue is the absence of a default encoding in cases where the response's encoding is not explicitly set. By ensuring there's always an encoding to use when `decode_unicode=True`, it aims to resolve the user's issue without broader impacts on the library's functionality."
