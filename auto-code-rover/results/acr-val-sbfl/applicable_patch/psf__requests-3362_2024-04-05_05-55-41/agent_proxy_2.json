To achieve this, let's focus on how the encoding is determined for a response and ensure that the `decode_unicode` parameter's behavior is as expected in the `iter_content` method. \n\nTo get more context on how encoding is determined and applied, we should look into the following:\n\n1. How the response's encoding is set or determined within the `requests` library. This could involve the headers of the response or some form of auto-detection.\n2. Any related documentation or comments within the codebase that explain the intended behavior of `iter_content` when `decode_unicode=True` is used, especially in relation to JSON content.\n\nConstructing search API calls to gather this information:\n\n- search_method_in_class(\"encoding\", \"Response\")\n- search_code(\"Content-Type\")\n- search_code(\"charset\")\n\nThese searches aim to uncover how `Response.encoding` is determined, which directly impacts the behavior of `stream_decode_response_unicode` when decoding content in `iter_content`. Understanding this process better will help in identifying whether the issue lies in the encoding detection, application, or elsewhere."
