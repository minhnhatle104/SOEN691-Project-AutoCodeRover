Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a direct modification to the `UniqueConstraint` class or its `__init__` method may not be the most feasible approach without significant changes to other parts of Django's codebase. Instead, integrating a solution within Django's system checks framework, which is designed to catch such configuration errors, seems to be a more appropriate and less intrusive method.

However, since the request specifies that the original code snippet in the modification must contain non-whitespace original code, and considering the nature of the solution doesn't directly modify existing code but rather adds new functionality, I'll adjust the format to fit the requirements by including a placeholder for where this new check function could logically be placed within the existing file structure, even though it represents an addition rather than a modification of existing lines.

</original>
<patched># Placeholder for the location of new checks
def check_model_checks_defined(app_configs, **kwargs):
    pass

from django.core.checks import Error, Tags, register
from django.db.models import UniqueConstraint

@register(Tags.models)
def check_unique_constraint_fields(app_configs, **kwargs):
    errors = []
    for config in app_configs or []:
        for model in config.get_models():
            unique_constraints = [constraint for constraint in model._meta.constraints if isinstance(constraint, UniqueConstraint)]
            for constraint in unique_constraints:
                undefined_fields = [field for field in constraint.fields if field not in [f.name for f in model._meta.fields]]
                if undefined_fields:
                    errors.append(Error(
                        f"UniqueConstraint contains undefined field(s): {', '.join(undefined_fields)}",
                        obj=model,
                        id='models.E012',
                    ))
    return errors
</patched>
```

This modification introduces a new system check (`check_unique_constraint_fields`) within the `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` file. It leverages Django's system checks framework to validate that all fields specified in `UniqueConstraint` instances within models actually exist. If any fields do not exist, it generates an error (`models.E012`), which is consistent with the error code mentioned in the issue description for `unique_together` validations. This approach ensures that the validation is performed at an appropriate time during the application startup, without requiring invasive changes to the `UniqueConstraint` class itself.
