To address the issue, we need to add a check in the `UniqueConstraint`'s `__init__` method to ensure that the fields specified actually exist on the model. This involves modifying the `django/db/models/constraints.py` file. Since the `UniqueConstraint` class does not have direct access to the model's fields during its initialization, the actual validation might need to be deferred until the constraint is added to a model. However, for the purpose of this patch, we will focus on the immediate code change required in the `__init__` method to introduce a placeholder for such validation.

This patch introduces a new optional parameter `model` to the `__init__` method of `UniqueConstraint` and a new method `_validate_model_fields` to perform the validation. The actual integration to pass the model instance when creating `UniqueConstraint` instances within Django's model framework would require additional changes in the codebase where `UniqueConstraint` instances are created and associated with models. This patch serves as a conceptual solution to demonstrate how the validation could be implemented. Further integration would be needed to fully resolve the issue as described.
