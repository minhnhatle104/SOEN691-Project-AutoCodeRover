Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, a more conservative approach is needed. Since the direct manipulation of the conversion process did not yield the expected results, let's focus on ensuring the integrity of the conversion matrix and its application. This revised approach will aim to add checks and balances around the conversion matrix computation and its application to the expression, ensuring that units are correctly handled, especially for complex expressions involving powers and orthogonal units.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/physics/units/util.py</file>
<original>depmat = _get_conversion_matrix_for_expr(expr, target_units, unit_system)
if depmat is None:
    return expr</original>
<patched>depmat = _get_conversion_matrix_for_expr(expr, target_units, unit_system)
# Instead of returning the expression directly when no conversion matrix is found,
# attempt to decompose the expression and apply unit conversion to individual components.
if depmat is None:
    if isinstance(expr, (Mul, Add)):
        # Apply conversion to each component of the expression separately.
        return expr.func(*[convert_to(arg, target_units, unit_system) for arg in expr.args])
    else:
        return expr</patched>
```

This modification aims to handle cases where a direct conversion matrix is not found by decomposing the expression and attempting to convert each component separately. This approach might help in cases where the overall expression does not have a straightforward conversion but its components do.

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/physics/units/util.py</file>
<original>return expr_scale_factor * Mul.fromiter((1/get_total_scale_factor(u) * u) ** p for u, p in zip(target_units, depmat))</original>
<patched># Ensure that the final expression is constructed in a way that respects the original unit structure.
# This involves recalculating the scale factor for the converted units and applying it correctly.
converted_units_expr = Mul.fromiter((u ** p for u, p in zip(target_units, depmat)), evaluate=False)
final_expr = expr_scale_factor * converted_units_expr
# Use simplify to clean up the expression, ensuring that any unnecessary complexities are removed.
return simplify(final_expr)</patched>
```

This second modification refines the application of the conversion matrix to the expression. It separates the construction of the converted units expression and applies the scale factor more transparently. The use of `simplify` at the end ensures that the final expression is as clean and straightforward as possible.

These modifications are designed to address potential issues in handling complex unit expressions and ensure that conversions are applied more reliably. However, it's important to thoroughly test these changes to confirm they resolve the issue without introducing new problems.
