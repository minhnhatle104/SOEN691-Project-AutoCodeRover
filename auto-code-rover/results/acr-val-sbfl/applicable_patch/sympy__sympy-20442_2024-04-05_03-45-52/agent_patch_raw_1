Based on the provided context and the issue described, it seems the unexpected behavior in the `convert_to` function might be due to how the conversion matrix is applied or how the total scale factor is calculated, especially for expressions involving units with exponents. Without specific details on the exact cause of the bug, a general approach to patching could involve ensuring that the conversion process respects the mathematical properties of units and their combinations.

Given the complexity of the issue and without a precise pinpoint of the bug, I'll propose a hypothetical patch that aims to refine the handling of expressions involving powers during the conversion. This patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential direction for fixing the issue based on the provided context.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/physics/units/util.py</file>
<original>if depmat is None:
    return expr</original>
<patched># Check if the conversion matrix is None and if the expression involves powers that might not have been handled correctly.
if depmat is None:
    # Attempt a more direct conversion if possible when the matrix is not applicable.
    if isinstance(expr, Pow) and isinstance(expr.base, Quantity):
        base_unit = unit_system.get_dimensional_expr(expr.base)
        if base_unit in target_units:
            # Adjust the expression to directly convert the base unit and apply the exponent afterwards.
            converted_base = expr.base.convert_to(target_units, unit_system)
            return Pow(converted_base, expr.exp)
    return expr</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/physics/units/util.py</file>
<original>expr_scale_factor = get_total_scale_factor(expr)
return expr_scale_factor * Mul.fromiter((1/get_total_scale_factor(u) * u) ** p for u, p in zip(target_units, depmat))</original>
<patched># Adjust the calculation of the expression scale factor to handle complex unit expressions more accurately.
expr_scale_factor = get_total_scale_factor(expr)
# Ensure that the multiplication respects the original unit proportions and exponents.
patched_expr = Mul.fromiter((expr_scale_factor/get_total_scale_factor(u) * u) ** p for u, p in zip(target_units, depmat))
# Simplify the resulting expression to ensure any redundant units or factors are properly reduced.
return simplify(patched_expr)</patched>
```

Please note, these patches are speculative and aim to address potential areas in the `convert_to` function that could lead to the reported issue. Actual implementation might require a deeper understanding of the specific cause of the bug and testing to ensure the patch correctly resolves the issue without introducing new ones.
