Given the context and the issue with parsing Greek characters in the `MathematicaParser` class, a potential cause could be the handling of symbol names that are not directly supported by the Python syntax used in the `sympify` function. Since Greek characters are valid in Mathematica and should be converted to their SymPy equivalents, we need to ensure that these characters are correctly recognized and transformed during the parsing process.

One approach to address this issue is to enhance the `_from_fullformlist_to_sympy` method to explicitly handle Greek characters by mapping them to their corresponding SymPy symbols. This requires importing the `symbols` function from SymPy and adding a mapping for Greek characters.

This patch introduces a mapping for Greek symbols within the `_from_fullformlist_to_sympy` method, allowing the parser to recognize and convert Greek characters from Mathematica expressions to their corresponding symbols in SymPy. The `symbols` function is used to dynamically create symbols for Greek characters, ensuring they are correctly interpreted and included in the resulting SymPy expression.
