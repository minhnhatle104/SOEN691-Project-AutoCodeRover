Given the nature of the issue with parsing Greek characters and the provided context, it seems that the problem might not be directly related to the handling of Greek characters as symbols within the parsing process itself. Instead, the issue might stem from the initial tokenization or the interpretation of tokens as valid SymPy expressions. Since the direct mapping of Greek characters or enhancing the symbol handling did not resolve the issue, we might need to consider ensuring that Greek characters are correctly tokenized and recognized as valid parts of expressions throughout the parsing process.

Considering this, a more general approach could be to ensure that the tokenization process correctly handles Greek characters by treating them as valid parts of symbol names. This adjustment does not require specific handling of Greek characters but rather ensures that the tokenizer correctly identifies them as part of valid identifiers.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/parsing/mathematica.py</file>
<original>_literal = r"[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*"</original>
<patched>_literal = r"[A-Za-zα-ωΑ-Ω][A-Za-zα-ωΑ-Ω0-9]*"</patched>
```

This modification expands the regular expression used for identifying literals (which can include symbol names) to include Greek lowercase and uppercase characters. By doing so, the tokenizer will recognize tokens containing Greek characters as valid literals, which should then be correctly processed in subsequent stages of the parsing process.

This approach addresses the issue at a more foundational level by ensuring that Greek characters are not discarded or misinterpreted during the initial tokenization stage, which is critical for correctly parsing expressions containing these characters.
