When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.\nThis problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.\nThis can be easily added into default Django static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:\ndef render(self, context):\nurl = self.url(context)\n# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME']\nif self.varname is None:\nreturn url\ncontext[self.varname] = url\nreturn ''\nOn more research I found that FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage ignores SCRIPT_NAME as well.\nWe might have to do a lot of changes but I think it's worth the efforts.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze the key components related to the issue of adding support for `SCRIPT_NAME` in `STATIC_URL` and `MEDIA_URL`:\n\n1. **FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage**:\n   - Both `FileSystemStorage` and `StaticFilesStorage` classes are crucial for handling file storage in Django. `StaticFilesStorage` inherits from `FileSystemStorage`, indicating that any changes affecting URL handling in `FileSystemStorage` could also impact `StaticFilesStorage`.\n   - The `url` method in `FileSystemStorage` is likely where the URL for a file is generated. This method could be a potential place to integrate `SCRIPT_NAME` support, ensuring that the generated URLs correctly include the script prefix when necessary.\n\n2. **set_script_prefix and clear_script_prefix**:\n   - The `set_script_prefix` method in `django/urls/base.py` allows setting a script prefix for the current thread, which is a critical piece of functionality for handling applications deployed under a sub-path.\n   - The existence of these methods indicates that Django has a mechanism for handling script prefixes, but this mechanism might not be fully integrated or utilized in the context of static and media URLs.\n\n3. **Static Template Tag**:\n   - The search for the `{% static '...' %}` template tag didn't return results, which might be due to the search query's specificity or limitations in accessing template tag implementations via the provided APIs. However, the description of the issue suggests that the `static` template tag directly appends `STATIC_URL` to the path without considering `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n   - The absence of direct search results for the `static` template tag means we'll need to infer its behavior based on the issue description and our understanding of Django's handling of static files. The template tag likely relies on the underlying storage system's `url` method to generate the full URL for static files.\n\n**Analysis Summary**:\nTo address the issue, modifications are likely needed in the following areas:\n- Enhancing the `url` method in `FileSystemStorage` (and by extension, `StaticFilesStorage`) to consider `SCRIPT_NAME` when generating URLs.\n- Ensuring that the `static` template tag (and potentially other mechanisms that generate URLs for static and media files) properly incorporates the script prefix set by `set_script_prefix`.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Propose changes to the `url` method in `FileSystemStorage` to prepend `SCRIPT_NAME` to generated URLs if it's set.\n- Investigate further into the implementation of the `static` template tag to understand how it constructs URLs and identify where adjustments are needed to include `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n- Consider how `set_script_prefix` is currently used across the application and ensure consistent application of the script prefix in all URL generation contexts."
