Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to ensure compatibility and address potential issues that might have caused the tests to fail. The primary goal remains to correctly prepend the `SCRIPT_NAME` to URLs generated for static and media files without introducing regressions.

# modification 1 (Refined)
```python
<file>django/core/files/storage.py</file>
<original>    def url(self, name):
        if self.base_url is None:
            raise ValueError("This file is not accessible via a URL.")
        url = filepath_to_uri(name)
        if url is not None:
            url = url.lstrip('/')
        return urljoin(self.base_url, url)</original>
<patched>    def url(self, name):
        from django.urls import get_script_prefix
        if self.base_url is None:
            raise ValueError("This file is not accessible via a URL.")
        url = filepath_to_uri(name)
        if url is not None:
            url = url.lstrip('/')
        # Ensure base_url ends with a slash for correct urljoin behavior
        base_url_with_slash = self.base_url if self.base_url.endswith('/') else self.base_url + '/'
        full_url = urljoin(base_url_with_slash, url)
        # Prepend the SCRIPT_NAME prefix if not already included
        script_prefix = get_script_prefix()
        if not full_url.startswith(script_prefix):
            # Ensure script_prefix ends with a slash for correct urljoin behavior
            script_prefix_with_slash = script_prefix if script_prefix.endswith('/') else script_prefix + '/'
            full_url = urljoin(script_prefix_with_slash, full_url.lstrip('/'))
        return full_url</patched>
```

This refined modification ensures that both `base_url` and `script_prefix` are correctly formatted with trailing slashes before being used in `urljoin`. This is crucial for preventing issues related to the concatenation of paths without proper separators, which might have been a cause of the test failures. Additionally, this approach carefully checks if the `SCRIPT_NAME` is already included in the `full_url` to avoid duplicating the prefix, addressing potential redundancy or incorrect path construction that could also lead to failed tests.
