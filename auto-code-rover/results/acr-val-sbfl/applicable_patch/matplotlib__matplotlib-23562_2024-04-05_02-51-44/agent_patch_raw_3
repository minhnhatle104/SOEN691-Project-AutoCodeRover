Given the constraints and the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue, it appears the solution requires a different approach. The initial problem stems from the absence of the `_facecolors2d` attribute in the `Poly3DCollection` object when `get_facecolors` is called. Since modifying the handling of `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` directly did not resolve the issue, a possible solution is to ensure these attributes are always initialized and accessible, but in a way that doesn't conflict with the existing logic for 3D to 2D projection and color handling.

Considering the error and the structure of the `Poly3DCollection` class, it seems the issue might be resolved by ensuring that `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` are initialized early enough in the object's lifecycle and correctly updated or accessed. However, since direct modifications to handle these attributes differently have not been successful, a more fundamental misunderstanding of the problem might be present, or there might be limitations in the provided context and actions that can be taken.

Given the constraints and the nature of this platform, where iterative debugging and testing are not possible, the best course of action would be to review the logic surrounding the use and initialization of `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` within the `Poly3DCollection` class. This would involve:

1. Ensuring that these attributes are initialized at the time of object creation or shortly thereafter, to prevent access before initialization.
2. Reviewing the logic in methods that modify the 3D properties (`set_3d_properties`, `do_3d_projection`, etc.) to ensure that any changes that could affect the 2D representation of colors are correctly propagated to `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d`.
3. Considering the introduction of a method or logic to safely access `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d`, which could involve checking for their existence and initializing them if they are not present.

Without the ability to directly test and debug within this environment, and given the limitations of the provided context and the feedback on previous attempts, further specific code patches cannot be confidently provided. The resolution of this issue would likely benefit from a closer examination of the `Poly3DCollection` class's lifecycle and interactions with its superclass, `PolyCollection`, within the broader matplotlib codebase.
