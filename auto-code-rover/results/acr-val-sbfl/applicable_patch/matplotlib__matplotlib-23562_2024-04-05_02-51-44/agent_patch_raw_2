Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more effectively, a revised approach is necessary. The core issue seems to stem from the fact that the `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` attributes are not always initialized or updated before they are accessed. A more robust solution would ensure these attributes are properly initialized and updated whenever the 3D properties are set or modified. This approach prevents the `AttributeError` and ensures consistency in the color attributes used for rendering.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py</file>
<original>def set_3d_properties(self):
    # Force the collection to initialize the face and edgecolors
    # just in case it is a scalarmappable with a colormap.
    self.update_scalarmappable()
    self._sort_zpos = None
    self.set_zsort('average')
    self._facecolor3d = PolyCollection.get_facecolor(self)
    self._edgecolor3d = PolyCollection.get_edgecolor(self)
    self._alpha3d = PolyCollection.get_alpha(self)
    self.stale = True</original>
<patched>def set_3d_properties(self):
    # Force the collection to initialize the face and edgecolors
    # just in case it is a scalarmappable with a colormap.
    self.update_scalarmappable()
    self._sort_zpos = None
    self.set_zsort('average')
    self._facecolor3d = PolyCollection.get_facecolor(self)
    self._edgecolor3d = PolyCollection.get_edgecolor(self)
    self._alpha3d = PolyCollection.get_alpha(self)
    # Initialize _facecolors2d and _edgecolors2d to match 3D colors
    self._facecolors2d = self._facecolor3d
    self._edgecolors2d = self._edgecolor3d
    self.stale = True</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py</file>
<original>def do_3d_projection(self):
    ...
    if len(self._edgecolor3d) != len(cface):
        self._edgecolors2d = self._edgecolor3d</original>
<patched>def do_3d_projection(self):
    ...
    # Ensure _facecolors2d and _edgecolors2d are always updated to reflect current state
    self._facecolors2d = np.asarray(cface)
    self._edgecolors2d = np.asarray(cedge)</patched>
```

These modifications ensure that `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` are properly initialized in the `set_3d_properties` method and correctly updated in the `do_3d_projection` method to reflect the current state. This approach addresses the issue by ensuring these attributes are always in sync with their 3D counterparts, thus preventing the `AttributeError` when attempting to access them.
