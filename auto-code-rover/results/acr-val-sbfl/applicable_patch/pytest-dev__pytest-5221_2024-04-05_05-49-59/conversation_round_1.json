The relevant components likely involve the fixture registration and information display mechanisms. Let's start by searching for methods and code related to fixture information display and registration.\n\n1. Search for the method responsible for handling the `--fixtures` argument in pytest. This will likely be part of the command-line parsing or a dedicated method for handling fixture-related commands.\n2. Search for the code or method that registers or stores fixture information, including scope. This is essential to understand how pytest keeps track of fixture scopes internally.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n- search_method(method_name: \"parse_arguments\")\n- search_method(method_name: \"register_fixture\")\n- search_code(code_str: \"--fixtures\")"

        "content": "Based on the search results, it appears that the handling of the `--fixtures` argument and possibly the registration or management of fixtures within pytest are spread across multiple files. The absence of direct hits for `parse_arguments` and `register_fixture` suggests that pytest might use different naming conventions or structures for these functionalities. However, the presence of relevant code snippets in several files provides a good starting point for our analysis.\n\n1. **testing/test_helpconfig.py** and **src/_pytest/helpconfig.py**: These files likely contain code related to the configuration of pytest help options, including the `--fixtures` argument. The presence of `--fixtures` in both testing and source directories suggests that there is both implementation and testing of this feature within these files.\n\n2. **testing/python/show_fixtures_per_test.py**, **testing/python/fixtures.py**, and **testing/logging/test_fixture.py**: These files in the testing directory suggest that there are tests specifically designed to assess the behavior of fixtures and possibly their display with the `--fixtures` option. This could include tests for the visibility of fixtures, their scope, and how they are presented to the user.\n\n3. **src/_pytest/python.py** and **src/_pytest/fixtures.py**: These source files are likely central to the handling of fixtures within pytest. Given the naming, `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` could be responsible for the registration, management, and possibly scope handling of fixtures. Meanwhile, `src/_pytest/python.py` might deal with Python-specific test and fixture handling, including integration with the `--fixtures` argument.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps should involve a deeper examination of these files to understand how pytest currently displays fixture information and where modifications could be made to include fixture scopes in the output. Specifically, we should look into how fixtures are registered and managed in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`, how the `--fixtures` argument is parsed and handled in `src/_pytest/helpconfig.py`, and how fixture information is displayed to the user, which could involve code in `src/_pytest/python.py` and the testing files. This analysis will help identify the exact locations and mechanisms to modify for adding fixture scope information to the `--fixtures` output."
