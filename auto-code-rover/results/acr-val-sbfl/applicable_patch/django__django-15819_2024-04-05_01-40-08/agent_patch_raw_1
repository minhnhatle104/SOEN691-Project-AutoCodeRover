This modification addresses the issue by automatically generating a `related_name` for `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` fields. The `related_name` is constructed using the model name derived from the table name, ensuring uniqueness and avoiding the reverse accessor clashes described in the issue. This approach uses a simple pattern that appends `_%(class)s_related` to the model name, leveraging Django's ability to replace `%(class)s` with the name of the model where the relationship is defined. This solution assumes that the `table2model` function generates sufficiently unique model names from table names, which is a reasonable assumption given Django's `inspectdb` usage patterns.
