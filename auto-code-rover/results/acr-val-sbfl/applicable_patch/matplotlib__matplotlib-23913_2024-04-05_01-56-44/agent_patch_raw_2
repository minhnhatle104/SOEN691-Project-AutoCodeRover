Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to ensure the patch correctly implements the feature request and addresses any potential issues that might have caused the tests to fail. It's crucial to integrate the `draggable` parameter properly and ensure it interacts correctly with the existing codebase, particularly with how the draggable state of the legend is managed.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/legend.py</file>
<original>def __init__(
        self, parent, handles, labels,
        loc=None,
        numpoints=None,      # number of points in the legend line
        markerscale=None,    # relative size of legend markers vs. original
        markerfirst=True,    # left/right ordering of legend marker and label
        scatterpoints=None,  # number of scatter points
        scatteryoffsets=None,
        prop=None,           # properties for the legend texts
        fontsize=None,       # keyword to set font size directly
        labelcolor=None,     # keyword to set the text color
        ...
        alignment="center",       # control the alignment within the legend box
        *,
        ncol=1  # synonym for ncols (backward compatibility)
    ):</original>
<patched>def __init__(
        self, parent, handles, labels,
        loc=None,
        numpoints=None,      # number of points in the legend line
        markerscale=None,    # relative size of legend markers vs. original
        markerfirst=True,    # left/right ordering of legend marker and label
        scatterpoints=None,  # number of scatter points
        scatteryoffsets=None,
        prop=None,           # properties for the legend texts
        fontsize=None,       # keyword to set font size directly
        labelcolor=None,     # keyword to set the text color
        draggable=None,      # make legend draggable
        ...
        alignment="center",       # control the alignment within the legend box
        *,
        ncol=1  # synonym for ncols (backward compatibility)
    ):</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/legend.py</file>
<original>self.set_title(title, prop=title_prop_fp)
        self._draggable = None</original>
<patched>self.set_title(title, prop=title_prop_fp)
        # Initialize draggable state based on the draggable parameter
        if draggable is not None:
            self.set_draggable(draggable, use_blit=False, update='loc')
        else:
            self._draggable = None</patched>
```

This revised patch ensures that the `draggable` parameter is correctly added to the `__init__` method of the `Legend` class and that the `set_draggable` method is called with appropriate arguments if `draggable` is not `None`. This approach should maintain backward compatibility while enabling the new functionality. Additionally, it explicitly handles the case where `draggable` is not provided (i.e., `None`), ensuring that the legend's draggable state is not altered unintentionally.
