            "content": "Given the feedback, it seems necessary to refine our understanding of how `constrained_layout` is managed and interacts with the layout engine, particularly in the context of `subplots_adjust`. To get a more precise location of the bug and understand the handling of `constrained_layout` in greater detail, the following additional context would be beneficial:\n\n1. Investigate how the layout engine is determined and its compatibility with `subplots_adjust` and `tight_layout` is assessed. This requires looking into the method that sets or gets the layout engine for a figure.\n2. Understand the implementation details of `constrained_layout` to see if there's a specific condition or oversight that leads to the warning being issued even when `constrained_layout=False`.\n\nTherefore, the additional API calls I would like to make are:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"get_layout_engine\", \"FigureBase\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"constrained_layout\", \"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a deeper insight into the handling of the layout engine and `constrained_layout` setting, which should help in pinpointing the bug's location more precisely."
