            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how `constrained_layout` is handled within the Matplotlib codebase, especially in relation to `plt.subplots_adjust` and the generation of warnings. Given the information in the issue, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Search for the method that handles `plt.subplots_adjust` to understand how it interacts with `constrained_layout` settings.\n2. Search for the method or code snippet that generates the UserWarning mentioned in the issue to understand under what conditions it is triggered.\n3. Since the issue mentions that the warning is related to the use of `constrained_layout=False`, it would be useful to search for code snippets where `constrained_layout` is checked or modified.\n\nTherefore, the API calls I would like to make are:\n\n- `search_method(\"subplots_adjust\")`\n- `search_code(\"UserWarning\")`\n- `search_code(\"constrained_layout\")`"
