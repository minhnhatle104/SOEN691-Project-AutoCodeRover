Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that my previous attempts to directly modify the handling of the layout engine in relation to the `constrained_layout` setting may not directly address the core issue or might introduce other problems leading to test failures. A more nuanced approach is required, focusing on the specific interaction that leads to the warning being issued unnecessarily.

Given the complexity of the issue and the limitations of the provided context, a precise patch cannot be confidently proposed without a deeper understanding of the internal workings and dependencies within the Matplotlib codebase, especially concerning how layout engines are managed and how their compatibility with various layout adjustments is determined.

However, a general direction for a potential solution, based on the information gathered, would involve ensuring that when `constrained_layout` is explicitly set to `False`, this setting is respected throughout the figure's lifecycle, particularly before any layout adjustments (such as `subplots_adjust`) are applied. This would likely involve a conditional check within the relevant methods to bypass or modify behavior based on the `constrained_layout` setting.

Without the ability to directly test changes or review the full codebase, further speculation on a specific patch may not be productive. It would be advisable to review the issue with the Matplotlib development team or community, possibly through their issue tracker or discussion forums, where a more interactive and iterative approach to debugging and patch development can be undertaken.
