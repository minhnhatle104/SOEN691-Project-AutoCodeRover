Specifically, I will focus on the methods and classes mentioned in the traceback and the external analysis tool output. Here are the API calls I would like to make:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"ImmutableDenseNDimArray.__new__\", \"sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py\")` - This will help understand how the `__new__` method is implemented for `ImmutableDenseNDimArray`, which seems to be directly involved in the error.\n\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"_new\", \"sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py\")` - Since the `_new` method is also mentioned in the traceback, understanding its implementation will be crucial.\n\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"_scan_iterable_shape\", \"sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py\")` - This method is responsible for scanning the shape of the iterable, and the error seems to occur during this process.\n\n4. `search_method_in_file(\"_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs\", \"sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py\")` - This method handles the inputs for ndarray creation, and understanding its logic will be important for resolving the issue.\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive understanding of the code sections involved in the issue, allowing for an informed approach to patching the bug."
