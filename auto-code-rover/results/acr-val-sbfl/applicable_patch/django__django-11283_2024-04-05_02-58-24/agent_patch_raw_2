Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, a revised approach is needed. The original patch aimed to individually update permissions and check for duplicates, which might not have addressed all edge cases or the underlying cause of the issue effectively. Let's consider a different strategy that ensures the migration does not attempt to create duplicate permissions by more thoroughly checking existing permissions before attempting any updates.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py</file>
<original>Permission.objects.filter(
    permissions_query,
    content_type=old_content_type,
).update(content_type=new_content_type)</original>
<patched># First, collect all permissions that match the query and would be updated
permissions_to_update = Permission.objects.filter(
    permissions_query,
    content_type=old_content_type,
)

# Collect codenames of permissions that already exist with the new content type
existing_permission_codenames = set(Permission.objects.filter(
    content_type=new_content_type,
).values_list('codename', flat=True))

updated_permissions = []
for permission in permissions_to_update:
    # Only proceed with update if there's no permission with the same codename for the new content type
    if permission.codename not in existing_permission_codenames:
        permission.content_type = new_content_type
        updated_permissions.append(permission)
    else:
        # Log or handle permissions that would cause duplicate issues
        print(f"Duplicate permission detected and skipped: {permission.codename} for content type {new_content_type}")

# Bulk update the collected permissions to minimize database hits
Permission.objects.bulk_update(updated_permissions, ['content_type'])</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a more cautious approach by first collecting all permissions that are candidates for updating their `content_type`. It then checks against existing permissions with the new `content_type` to ensure no duplicates would be created by the update. Only permissions that do not conflict with existing ones are updated, and the update is performed using `bulk_update` for efficiency. This approach aims to prevent the creation of duplicate permissions by ensuring that an update only occurs when it will not result in a conflict, addressing the core issue without causing test failures.
