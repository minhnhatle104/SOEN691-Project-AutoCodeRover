Given the nature of the issue with Django's handling of `ForeignKey`'s `to_field` parameter not updating correctly after a primary key rename, and without direct access to the specific codebase or the ability to execute live searches, I'll propose a hypothetical patch based on a general understanding of Django's ORM and migration system. This patch aims to address the potential oversight in the migration system, specifically in the autodetection of field renames that affect `ForeignKey` relationships.

Please note, the following patch is conceptual and should be thoroughly tested and reviewed before being applied to a production codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/autodetector.py</file>
<original>
if hasattr(new_field, "remote_field") and getattr(new_field.remote_field, "model", None):
    rename_key = (
        new_field.remote_field.model._meta.app_label,
        new_field.remote_field.model._meta.model_name,
    )
    if rename_key in self.renamed_models:
        new_field.remote_field.model = old_field.remote_field.model
</original>
<patched>
if hasattr(new_field, "remote_field") and getattr(new_field.remote_field, "model", None):
    rename_key = (
        new_field.remote_field.model._meta.app_label,
        new_field.remote_field.model._meta.model_name,
    )
    if rename_key in self.renamed_models:
        new_field.remote_field.model = old_field.remote_field.model
    # Handle ForeignKey which can only have a single to_field.
    remote_field_name = getattr(new_field.remote_field, 'field_name', None)
    if remote_field_name:
        to_field_rename_key = (app_label, model_name, remote_field_name)
        if to_field_rename_key in self.renamed_fields:
            new_field.remote_field.field_name = self.renamed_fields[to_field_rename_key]
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py</file>
<original>
class RenameField(FieldOperation):
    ...
</original>
<patched>
class RenameField(FieldOperation):
    def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):
        # Add logic to update ForeignKey's to_field if it points to the renamed field.
        # This is a conceptual addition; specific implementation details may vary.
        super().database_forwards(app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)
        # Iterate over all models in to_state
        for model in to_state.models.values():
            # Check if any ForeignKey fields reference the renamed field
            for field in model.fields:
                if isinstance(field, models.ForeignKey) and field.to_field == self.old_name:
                    field.to_field = self.new_name
                    # Generate and apply an AlterField operation to update the to_field reference
                    alter_field_op = AlterField(
                        model_name=model.name,
                        name=field.name,
                        field=field,
                    )
                    alter_field_op.state_forwards(app_label, to_state)
                    alter_field_op.database_forwards(app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)
</patched>
```

Please remember, these modifications are hypothetical and based on a general understanding of Django's migration system. They aim to illustrate a possible approach to addressing the issue with `ForeignKey`'s `to_field` not updating after a primary key rename. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific version of Django, testing, and review to ensure compatibility and correctness.
