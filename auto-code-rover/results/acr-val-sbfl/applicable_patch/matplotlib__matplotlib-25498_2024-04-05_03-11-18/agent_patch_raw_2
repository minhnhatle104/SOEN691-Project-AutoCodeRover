Given the constraints and the failure of the initial patch attempt, let's reconsider the approach to resolving the issue. The core problem seems to stem from how changes to the norm, particularly to `LogNorm`, are not properly reflected in the colorbar update mechanisms. Additionally, the `ZeroDivisionError` encountered suggests issues in handling logarithmic scales within the colorbar's value processing logic. 

However, without direct access to test outputs or specific details on the failures, we must refine our approach based on the provided code snippets and the described issue. Since the initial attempt to directly modify handling for `LogNorm` did not resolve the issue, a more general approach to ensuring the colorbar updates correctly for any norm changes might be necessary. 

Given the limitations, let's propose a theoretical patch that aims to ensure the colorbar's norm updates are handled more robustly, without making specific assumptions about the failure of the initial patch.

# Theoretical Patch Proposal

**Note:** This patch is conceptual and aims to address the described issue based on the provided context. It may require adjustments to fit the actual codebase and testing environment.

## Modification 1: Ensuring Norm Updates Trigger Colorbar Redraw

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py</file>
<original>        self._draw_all()</original>
<patched>        self._draw_all()
        # Ensure the colorbar reflects changes in the norm, including LogNorm.
        self.draw_all()</patched>
```

**Explanation:** This modification ensures that after updating the norm and potentially resetting the locator and formatter, the colorbar is redrawn to reflect these changes. The call to `self.draw_all()` is meant to encapsulate any additional drawing logic that might be necessary to fully update the colorbar's appearance. This is a speculative change aimed at addressing potential gaps in the redraw logic following a norm update.

## Modification 2: Robust Handling of Logarithmic Norms in Value Processing

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py</file>
<original>        if not self.norm.scaled():
            self.norm.vmin = 0
            self.norm.vmax = 1</original>
<patched>        # Adjust vmin and vmax for logarithmic norms to avoid division by zero.
        if isinstance(self.norm, LogNorm):
            self.norm.vmin, self.norm.vmax = self.norm.autoscale(np.ma.masked_invalid(self._boundaries))
        elif not self.norm.scaled():
            self.norm.vmin = 0
            self.norm.vmax = 1</patched>
```

**Explanation:** This modification directly addresses the potential cause of the `ZeroDivisionError` by providing a more nuanced handling of `vmin` and `vmax` for logarithmic norms. By using `autoscale` with masked invalid values in the boundaries, it aims to ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are set to valid, non-zero values for logarithmic scales, thus avoiding division by zero errors.

**Final Note:** These theoretical patches are designed based on the assumption that the issue lies in the incomplete handling of norm updates and the specific challenges of logarithmic norms. Actual implementation and testing are necessary to validate these solutions and may require further iteration based on test results and additional context from the codebase.
