This patch modifies the `prepend_prolog` function to better handle cases where the first heading in a document is a domain directive (e.g., `:mod:`). The original implementation only looked for docinfo fields and inserted the prolog immediately after these fields or at the beginning of the document if no docinfo fields were present. The patched version adds a check for lines starting with `.. `, which are used for directives in reStructuredText, and includes handling for empty lines that are part of a directive block. This ensures that the prolog is inserted in a location that does not interfere with the rendering of domain directives in top-level headings.
