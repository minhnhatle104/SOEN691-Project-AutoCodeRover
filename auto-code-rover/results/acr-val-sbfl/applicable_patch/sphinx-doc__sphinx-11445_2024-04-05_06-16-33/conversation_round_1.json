        "content": "The issue describes a problem where setting `rst_prolog` causes top-level headings that contain a domain directive (e.g., `:mod:`) to not render correctly or be included in the toctree. This problem occurs when `rst_prolog` is set in the Sphinx configuration, affecting the rendering of documents that start with a domain directive as their first heading.\n\nFrom the external analysis tool, we identified that the `prepend_prolog` function in `sphinx/util/rst.py` is among the top suspicious methods related to this issue. The `prepend_prolog` function is designed to prepend a string to the content body as a prolog. This is relevant because the `rst_prolog` setting in Sphinx is used to insert content at the beginning of every source file that is processed, which is exactly what this function appears to handle.\n\nThe code snippet from the `prepend_prolog` function shows how it inserts the prolog into the content. It looks for the position after any docinfo (metadata fields at the beginning of a document) and inserts the prolog there, along with a blank line before and after the prolog content. This is done by iterating through the content lines and using regular expression matching to find the end of the docinfo section if it exists.\n\nGiven the issue description and the role of the `prepend_prolog` function, it seems that the insertion of the prolog might be interfering with the correct rendering and inclusion of top-level headings that contain domain directives. Specifically, the process of inserting the prolog could be disrupting the expected structure of the document, leading to issues with how these headings are processed and rendered by Sphinx.\n\nTo address this issue, a potential patch might involve modifying the `prepend_prolog` function to ensure that the insertion of the prolog does not interfere with the rendering of domain directives in top-level headings. This could involve adjusting how and where the prolog is inserted or adding special handling for documents that start with a domain directive to ensure they are processed correctly."
