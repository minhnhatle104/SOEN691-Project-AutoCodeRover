Based on the analysis and the provided code snippet, the issue seems to be that the primary key (PK) of a model instance is not being set to `None` after deletion, specifically for models without any dependencies. The existing code does attempt to set the PK to `None` for all instances after deletion, but the issue report suggests this is not working as expected for models without dependencies. 

Given this, a potential patch would ensure that the PK is explicitly set to `None` for all instances after deletion, regardless of their dependency status. However, from the provided code snippet, it appears that the logic already attempts to do this. Therefore, the patch will focus on ensuring this logic is executed correctly and investigating if there's a condition under which it might not be reached or executed properly.

Since the provided code snippet already includes the logic for setting the PK to `None`, and without specific details on how it fails for models without dependencies, the patch will be more of a speculative improvement to ensure the operation's reliability.

<patched>        # Ensure PK is set to None in a more explicit context
        for model, instances in self.data.items():
            for instance in instances:
                # Explicitly check if instance is not None before setting PK to None
                if instance is not None:
                    setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)
                else:
                    # Log or handle the case where instance is unexpectedly None
                    pass</patched>
```

This modification adds a check to ensure that the instance is not `None` before attempting to set its PK to `None`. This is a speculative improvement, as the original issue might not stem from this part of the code. However, without more specific details on the failure mode for models without dependencies, this patch aims to improve the robustness of the existing logic.

If the issue persists or can be more precisely diagnosed, further modifications might be necessary, potentially involving earlier steps in the deletion process to ensure that models without dependencies are correctly handled and that the code block setting the PK to `None` is always reached and executed as intended.
