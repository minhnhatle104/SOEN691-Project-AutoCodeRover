Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's clear that a different approach is needed. The issue description and the code analysis suggest that the primary key is not being set to `None` for instances of models without any dependencies after they are deleted. The original logic intended to handle this seems to be in place but may not be functioning as expected under certain conditions.

Upon reevaluation, a more targeted approach is required to address the specific scenario described in the issue. Since the original code already attempts to set the PK to `None` for all instances after deletion, the problem might lie in the condition under which this operation is executed or in ensuring that it applies to models without dependencies as well.

Given the constraints and the information available, let's propose a revised patch that ensures the operation to set the PK to `None` is explicitly applied to all instances, with a particular focus on ensuring that it covers models without dependencies.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/deletion.py</file>
<original>        for model, instances in self.data.items():
            for instance in instances:
                setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)</original>
<patched>        # Ensure PK is set to None for all instances after deletion, explicitly checking for models without dependencies
        for model, instances in self.data.items():
            # Check if model has dependencies; if not, or if dependencies are already handled, proceed to set PK to None
            if not self.dependencies.get(model) or all(instance in self.data for instance in self.dependencies.get(model, [])):
                for instance in instances:
                    setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)
            else:
                # Log or handle cases where dependencies might affect setting PK to None
                pass</patched>
```

This modification introduces a more explicit check to ensure that the operation to set the PK to `None` considers whether the model has dependencies and whether those dependencies have been handled. This approach aims to address the issue by ensuring that models without dependencies—or where dependencies are not a factor—are explicitly included in the operation to reset the PK.

This patch is speculative, based on the understanding that the issue might relate to how models without dependencies are processed. If this approach does not resolve the issue, further investigation would be needed, possibly requiring a deeper dive into how dependencies are managed and how they impact the deletion process.
