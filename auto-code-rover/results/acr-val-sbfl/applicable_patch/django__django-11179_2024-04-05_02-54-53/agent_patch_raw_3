Given the complexity of the issue and the failure of the previous patches to resolve it, it's clear that a different approach or a more precise understanding of the problem is required. The issue at hand involves the `.delete()` method not setting the primary key (PK) of a model instance to `None` after deletion, specifically for models without any dependencies. The provided code snippet already includes logic intended to set the PK to `None` for all instances after deletion, suggesting that the problem might not be with the logic itself but perhaps with its execution under certain conditions.

Since the direct modifications to the existing logic have not resolved the issue, and without further specific details on the conditions under which the issue occurs, it's challenging to propose a targeted patch. However, considering the importance of ensuring the PK is set to `None` to reflect the deletion status of an instance accurately, a more general approach might involve reinforcing the existing logic with additional checks or restructuring it to ensure its effective execution.

Given the constraints and the feedback on the previous attempts, let's propose a conceptual patch that might address potential underlying issues not directly visible in the provided code snippet or the initial analysis.

# Conceptual Patch:

Since direct modifications based on the provided context have not been successful, and without the ability to further diagnose the issue through additional context or error logs, the following conceptual approach is suggested:

1. **Review Transaction Management:** Ensure that the transaction handling around the deletion process does not inadvertently prevent the update of the instance's state (e.g., setting the PK to `None`). This might involve verifying that the transaction is correctly committed and that there are no rollback conditions that might affect the state update.

2. **Enhance State Management:** After deletion, explicitly check and confirm the state of the instance to ensure it reflects the deletion. This could involve a post-deletion hook or a similar mechanism to verify and enforce the setting of the PK to `None`.

3. **Debugging and Logging:** Temporarily introduce enhanced logging or debugging around the deletion process, specifically targeting the logic that sets the PK to `None`. This could help identify any conditions under which this logic is bypassed or not executed as expected.

4. **Unit Tests:** Develop or review existing unit tests that specifically cover scenarios of deleting models with and without dependencies. Ensure these tests check not only the deletion from the database but also the post-deletion state of the model instances, including the PK being set to `None`.

This conceptual approach aims to provide a framework for further investigation and potential resolution of the issue, focusing on areas that might impact the execution of the logic to set the PK to `None` post-deletion. Given the limitations of the current context and the feedback on previous patches, a more in-depth analysis and potentially broader codebase review might be necessary to identify and resolve the underlying cause of the issue.
