Given the information from the issue and the tool output, I will start by examining the `cleanse_setting` method in the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class and the `__init__` method in the `LazyObject` class.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"cleanse_setting\", \"SafeExceptionReporterFilter\")` - This will help us understand how `cleanse_setting` is currently implemented and why it might not be handling iterables other than `dicts` properly.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"LazyObject\")` - Although the issue does not directly mention `LazyObject`, the tool output suggests there might be something worth investigating here. Understanding how `LazyObject` is initialized could provide insights into how it interacts with settings cleansing.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for diagnosing the issue."
