Given the constraints and the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue, let's reconsider the approach. The problem seems to stem from how categorical hues are being handled, especially when passed directly to the `map` method in a `PairGrid`. The error suggests that seaborn is attempting to use the hue values directly as keys in a lookup table, which fails because these categorical values are not present as keys, leading to a `KeyError`. This is followed by a `TypeError` when attempting to handle the missing key.

A more robust solution would involve ensuring that the hue values are properly processed and mapped to colors before attempting to use them as keys in the lookup table. This might require a check or preprocessing step in the `_lookup_single` method or a modification in how the `scatterplot` function passes hue values to the mapping functions. However, without the ability to directly modify and test the code, I'll propose a conceptual patch that could address the issue based on the provided context.

# Conceptual Patch:

## Modification 1: Preprocess Hue Values in `scatterplot`
Before calling the mapping functions, ensure that hue values are preprocessed to match the expected format or keys in the lookup table. This might involve ensuring that categorical hues are converted or mapped to their corresponding color values before being passed to the plotting functions.

```python
<file>seaborn/relational.py</file>
<original>    p.map_hue(palette=palette, order=hue_order, norm=hue_norm)</original>
<patched>    # Preprocess hue values if they are categorical to ensure they match the expected keys in the lookup table
    if hue is not None and isinstance(hue, pd.Series) and hue.dtype == 'category':
        # Convert categorical hue values to their corresponding color values
        # This is a conceptual step; the actual implementation would depend on how seaborn structures its color mappings
        hue_colors = hue.cat.categories.map(lambda x: palette[x] if x in palette else default_color)
        kwargs['hue'] = hue_colors
    p.map_hue(palette=palette, order=hue_order, norm=hue_norm)</patched>
```

## Modification 2: Robust Key Handling in `_lookup_single`
Improve the handling of keys in the `_lookup_single` method to gracefully handle cases where the key is not found in the lookup table, especially for categorical data.

```python
<file>seaborn/_oldcore.py</file>
<original>            try:
                normed = self.norm(key)
            except TypeError as err:
                if np.isnan(key):
                    value = (0, 0, 0, 0)
                else:
                    raise err</original>
<patched>            # If the key is not found and cannot be normalized, use a default color
            # This is a safer fallback to prevent errors with categorical data
            value = self.default_color  # Assuming there's a default color attribute or method available</patched>
```

These conceptual patches aim to address the issue by ensuring that categorical hue values are correctly mapped to colors before being used in the plotting functions and by providing a more robust fallback mechanism in the `_lookup_single` method to handle missing keys. Implementing these changes would require a deeper understanding of seaborn's internal structure and testing to ensure compatibility and correctness.
