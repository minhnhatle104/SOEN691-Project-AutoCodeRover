Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's approach the problem with a more direct and simplified strategy, focusing on directly catching and wrapping the `urllib3` exceptions within the methods where they are likely to occur, without introducing decorators. This approach aims to ensure compatibility and minimize the impact on existing code structure and tests.

### Modification 1: Directly Wrapping `DecodeError` in `requests/models.py`

```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import (
    DecodeError, ReadTimeoutError, ProtocolError, LocationParseError)
</original>
<patched>
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import (
    ReadTimeoutError, ProtocolError, LocationParseError)
from .exceptions import DecodeError as RequestsDecodeError
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Updating Exception Handling in `iter_content` Method in `requests/models.py`

```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>
def iter_content(self, chunk_size=1, decode_unicode=False):
    ...
                except ProtocolError as e:
                    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)
                except DecodeError as e:
                    raise ContentDecodingError(e)
                except ReadTimeoutError as e:
</original>
<patched>
def iter_content(self, chunk_size=1, decode_unicode=False):
    ...
                except ProtocolError as e:
                    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)
                except Urllib3DecodeError as e:
                    raise RequestsDecodeError(e)
                except ReadTimeoutError as e:
</patched>
```

### Modification 3: Directly Wrapping `TimeoutError` in `requests/adapters.py`

```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>
from requests.exceptions import ConnectionError, Timeout
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError
</original>
<patched>
from requests.exceptions import ConnectionError, Timeout, TimeoutError as RequestsTimeoutError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError as Urllib3TimeoutError
</patched>
```

### Modification 4: Updating Exception Handling for Timeout in `requests/adapters.py`

```python
<file>requests/adapters.py</file>
<original>
def send(self, request, stream=False, timeout=None, verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None):
    ...
        except TimeoutError as e:
            raise Timeout(e)
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def send(self, request, stream=False, timeout=None, verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None):
    ...
        except Urllib3TimeoutError as e:
            raise RequestsTimeoutError(e)
    ...
</patched>
```

These modifications aim to directly address the issue by ensuring that `urllib3` exceptions such as `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are explicitly caught and re-raised as the corresponding `requests` exceptions. This approach should maintain the existing structure and behavior of the `requests` library while ensuring that exceptions from `urllib3` are properly wrapped, potentially resolving the issue without introducing additional failures in tests.
