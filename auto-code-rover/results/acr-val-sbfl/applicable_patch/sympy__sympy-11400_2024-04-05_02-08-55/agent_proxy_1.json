The relevant file and method where this enhancement should be implemented are:\n    - **File**: `sympy/printing/ccode.py`\n    - **Method**: Modifications would likely be needed in the `CCodePrinter` class, specifically in how it handles unknown functions, which might involve extending the `known_functions` dictionary or modifying the `_print_Function` method to include a special case for `sinc`. \n\nNo additional context from the project is needed at this point since the analysis has provided a clear direction for implementing support for the `sinc` function in C code generation."
