Given the feedback and the need to address the issue with a different approach, let's revise the strategy for adding support for the `sinc` function in the `CCodePrinter` class. Since the direct modification approach did not work as expected, we'll try integrating the `sinc` function support more seamlessly into the existing structure.

The goal is to have `ccode(sinc(x))` generate a piecewise representation that is compatible with C, similar to how it's suggested in the issue description. This means we need to handle the `sinc` function specifically when it's encountered by the printer.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/ccode.py</file>
<original>self.known_functions = dict(known_functions)</original>
<patched>self.known_functions = dict(known_functions)
# Add a custom handler for sinc function
self.known_functions["sinc"] = "sinc_custom_handler"</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/ccode.py</file>
<original>elif hasattr(expr, '_imp_') and isinstance(expr._imp_, Lambda):
    # inlined function
    return self._print(expr._imp_(*expr.args))
else:
    return self._print_not_supported(expr)</original>
<patched>elif hasattr(expr, '_imp_') and isinstance(expr._imp_, Lambda):
    # inlined function
    return self._print(expr._imp_(*expr.args))
elif expr.func.__name__ == "sinc_custom_handler":
    # Handle sinc function specifically
    x = expr.args[0]
    return "((%(x)s) == 0 ? 1.0 : sin(%(x)s)/(%(x)s))" % {'x': self._print(x)}
else:
    return self._print_not_supported(expr)</patched>
```

This approach introduces a custom handler for the `sinc` function within the `CCodePrinter` class. The first modification adds a placeholder for the `sinc` function in the `known_functions` dictionary, which is then checked in the `_print_Function` method. The second modification specifically handles this placeholder, generating the desired piecewise representation for the `sinc` function in C code.

Please note, the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the broader context of the `sympy` codebase, existing coding standards, and thorough testing to ensure compatibility and correctness.
