Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, let's reconsider the approach. The core issue seems to be how `pylint` handles the scenario where a directory and a file share the same name, which is not inherently wrong but leads to unexpected behavior due to how Python's module system works. The initial patch attempted to directly address the symptom rather than ensuring `pylint` correctly interprets Python's module system in such scenarios.

A more robust solution would ensure that `pylint` correctly identifies and processes a directory as a module when a similarly named `.py` file exists in the same directory, without requiring manual intervention like renaming files or adding unnecessary `__init__.py` files. This involves improving how `pylint` determines what constitutes a module and ensuring it aligns with Python's expectations.

Given this, a revised approach would involve adjusting how `pylint` interprets directories and files during its linting process, specifically in the `get_ast` method where the AST is generated. This method should be more intelligent in handling directories that are also considered Python modules.

# Revised Patch
Since the initial patches did not resolve the issue and based on the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding of the problem's root cause. Therefore, without specific lines of code that directly cause the issue, a conceptual patch will be proposed to guide the necessary changes.

## Conceptual Patch:

### Modification in `get_ast` Method
The `get_ast` method should be adjusted to better handle scenarios where a directory and a file share the same name. This involves ensuring that when generating an AST for a directory (which is treated as a module in Python), `pylint` does not erroneously look for an `__init__.py` file in scenarios where it's not needed (Python 3's namespace packages).

```python
<file>pylint/lint/pylinter.py</file>
<original>
if data is None:
    return MANAGER.ast_from_file(filepath, modname, source=True)
</original>
<patched>
# Enhanced handling for directory modules without __init__.py
import os
if data is None:
    if os.path.isdir(filepath) and not os.path.exists(os.path.join(filepath, '__init__.py')):
        # Treat as a namespace package
        return MANAGER.ast_from_directory(filepath, modname)
    else:
        return MANAGER.ast_from_file(filepath, modname, source=True)
</patched>
```

Note: This patch assumes the existence of a hypothetical `ast_from_directory` method in the `MANAGER` object, which would need to be implemented to correctly handle directory modules (namespace packages) without requiring an `__init__.py` file. This method would generate an AST that correctly represents the directory as a module, aligning with Python 3's module import system.

### Additional Considerations
- Ensure that `MANAGER.ast_from_directory` correctly handles namespace packages, potentially by aggregating ASTs from all contained `.py` files.
- Review and adjust error handling in `get_ast` to provide more informative messages for issues related to module loading, especially in cases of naming conflicts.

This conceptual patch aims to address the root cause by aligning `pylint`'s handling of modules with Python's module system, particularly for namespace packages. It's important to further test this approach to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
