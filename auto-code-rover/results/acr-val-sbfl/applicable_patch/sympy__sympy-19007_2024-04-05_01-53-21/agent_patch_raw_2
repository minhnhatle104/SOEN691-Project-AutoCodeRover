Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more directly related to the handling of symbolic indices and the determination of which block an element comes from, let's propose a different approach. The original implementation does not account for the symbolic nature of indices which can lead to incorrect simplifications when accessing elements from a `BlockMatrix`. A more robust solution would involve explicitly handling symbolic indices and ensuring that the method correctly identifies from which block (A or B in the issue description) the element should be fetched.

                break
            else:
                i -= numrows
        for col_block, numcols in enumerate(self.colblocksizes):
            if (j < numcols) != False:
                break
            else:
                j -= numcols
        return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][i, j]</original>

        from sympy import Symbol
        # Initialize variables to track the block and adjusted indices
        row_block = None
        col_block = None
        adjusted_i = i
        adjusted_j = j

        # Determine the row block
        cumulative_rows = 0
        for idx, numrows in enumerate(self.rowblocksizes):
            if isinstance(i, Symbol) or cumulative_rows + numrows > i:
                row_block = idx
                break
            cumulative_rows += numrows
        adjusted_i -= cumulative_rows

        # Determine the column block
        cumulative_cols = 0
        for idx, numcols in enumerate(self.colblocksizes):
            if isinstance(j, Symbol) or cumulative_cols + numcols > j:
                col_block = idx
                break
            cumulative_cols += numcols
        adjusted_j -= cumulative_cols

        # Check if the block was determined; otherwise, raise an error
        if row_block is None or col_block is None:
            raise IndexError("BlockMatrix index out of range")

        # Fetch the element from the appropriate block
        return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][adjusted_i, adjusted_j]</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a different approach by explicitly handling the determination of the row and column blocks, especially under symbolic conditions. It adjusts the indices (`i`, `j`) based on the cumulative sizes of the blocks encountered, ensuring that the correct block is selected and the indices are correctly adjusted for the selected block. This approach should more accurately handle symbolic indices and address the issue of fetching the wrong matrix element from a `BlockMatrix`.
