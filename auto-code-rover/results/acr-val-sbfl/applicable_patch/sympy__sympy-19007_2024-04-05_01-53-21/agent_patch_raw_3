Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that the initial attempts to directly address the issue with symbolic handling and index adjustments may not have targeted the core of the problem effectively. The issue fundamentally lies in the incorrect simplification when accessing elements from a `BlockMatrix`, particularly with symbolic indices that cannot be directly compared or manipulated as integers.

Upon further reflection, the core issue seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem's nature. The problem description indicates that the current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the index could refer to elements in different blocks of the `BlockMatrix`. However, the provided patches attempted to address index range checking and symbolic index handling, which, while important, do not directly address the reported issue of incorrect element simplification.

Given this, it's clear that a different approach is needed, one that directly addresses the need for a more nuanced handling of symbolic indices in a `BlockMatrix`. However, without the ability to propose another patch based on the constraints and the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue, it's important to acknowledge the limitations in this scenario.

The correct approach would likely involve a deeper integration with SymPy's symbolic capabilities, ensuring that when indices are symbolic, the system retains the symbolic representation of the element access rather than attempting to prematurely simplify it to a specific block's element. This would require a nuanced understanding of SymPy's symbolic logic and possibly changes to how `BlockMatrix` interacts with symbolic indices.

Without the ability to submit another patch and given the complexity of the issue, the best course of action would be to consult with the SymPy documentation, explore how symbolic indices are handled in other parts of the library, and possibly engage with the SymPy community for insights on handling such cases. This would provide a more informed basis for addressing the issue in a manner consistent with SymPy's overall design and symbolic manipulation capabilities.
