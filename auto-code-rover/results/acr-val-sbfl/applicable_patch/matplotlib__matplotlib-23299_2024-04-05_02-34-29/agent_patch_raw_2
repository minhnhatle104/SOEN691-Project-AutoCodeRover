Given the complexity of the issue and the lack of a direct indication of the bug's cause from the provided context, a more generalized approach might be necessary to address potential mismanagement of figures within `Gcf` under `rc_context`. Since the issue seems to arise when `get_backend()` is called, leading to figures being cleared from `Gcf`, one speculative approach could be to ensure that the figure management within `Gcf` does not inadvertently lose track of figures due to changes in the backend or `rcParams` that might occur within an `rc_context`.

However, without a clear bug identified in the provided code snippets and considering the speculative nature of the previous patch, it's challenging to propose a new, specific code modification that would resolve the issue without introducing unintended side effects.

A more thorough investigation into how `rc_context` interacts with the backend and figure management, possibly involving debugging and tracing the execution flow, would be essential to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. This would likely involve examining how `rcParams` changes affect backend operations and figure lifecycle events, and ensuring that `Gcf`'s figure tracking remains consistent across these changes.

Given the constraints and the information available, I recommend the following steps for further investigation rather than attempting another speculative patch:

1. **Debugging and Tracing:**
   - Implement logging or debugging statements within `rc_context` and relevant methods of `Gcf` to trace how figures are managed and accessed before, during, and after the execution of `rc_context`.
   - Pay special attention to any changes in `rcParams` that affect the backend or figure management, and how these changes are reflected in the state of `Gcf`.

2. **Review Backend-Specific Behavior:**
   - Since the issue mentions the QtAgg backend, review the implementation of figure management within this backend to identify any behavior that might be sensitive to changes in `rcParams` or the execution context.

3. **Enhanced Testing:**
   - Develop additional test cases that mimic the issue scenario, focusing on creating figures within `rc_context` and observing how their management is affected by calls to `get_backend()` and other operations that might influence `rcParams` or backend state.

Without a clear direction for a patch based on the current understanding of the issue, these investigative steps are crucial for gathering more information and identifying a targeted solution.
