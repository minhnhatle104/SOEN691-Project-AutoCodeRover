Given the nature of the issue, it seems that the problem arises due to the interaction between `rc_context` and the figure management within `Gcf`, particularly when `get_backend()` is called. The issue suggests that figures created within an `rc_context` may not be properly tracked or managed by `Gcf` under certain conditions. However, without a clear indication of a specific bug in the provided code snippets or a direct cause-effect relationship identified in the analysis, proposing a precise patch is challenging. 

Nonetheless, based on the understanding of the issue, a speculative approach to address potential problems could involve ensuring that figure management within `Gcf` is robust against changes in the configuration, especially those temporarily made by `rc_context`. Here's a hypothetical patch that aims to enhance the resilience of figure tracking within `Gcf`:

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py</file>
<original>def destroy_fig(cls, fig):
    """Destroy figure *fig*."""
    num = next((manager.num for manager in cls.figs.values()
                if manager.canvas.figure == fig), None)
    if num is not None:
        cls.destroy(num)</original>
<patched>def destroy_fig(cls, fig):
    """Destroy figure *fig*."""
    # Enhanced check to ensure robust figure tracking
    num = None
    for manager_num, manager in cls.figs.items():
        if manager.canvas.figure == fig:
            num = manager_num
            break
    if num is not None:
        cls.destroy(num)</patched>
```

This modification changes the way a figure's manager number is determined when attempting to destroy a figure. The original code uses a generator expression with `next()` which might prematurely exit in certain contexts or configurations. The patched version iterates over all figure managers explicitly to find the correct manager number, which could potentially be more robust in scenarios where the configuration changes dynamically, such as within an `rc_context`.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on the analysis of the provided context. It aims to address potential issues in figure tracking within `Gcf` but may not directly resolve the reported issue without further testing and validation in the specific context of the problem. Additional investigation and debugging would be necessary to identify the root cause and develop a precise fix.
