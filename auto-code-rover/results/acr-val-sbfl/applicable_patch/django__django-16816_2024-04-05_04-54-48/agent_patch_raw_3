Given the constraints and the feedback received, it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the nature of the issue and the provided context. Since the initial and subsequent patches did not resolve the issue due to a lack of specific details about the `list_display` configuration and the relationship between `Question` and `Choice` models, we'll need to reassess our approach based on the error described and the general Django admin framework behavior.

The error message "Unable to lookup 'choice' on Question or QuestionAdmin" suggests that the admin interface expects a field or method named `choice` that it cannot find. Since the `QuestionAdmin` class provided does not include a `list_display` attribute, and considering the error occurs when accessing the admin page for `Question`, the issue likely lies in an incorrect or missing configuration that was supposed to be detailed in the issue description but was not directly provided in the code snippets.

Given this, and without specific details to correct, we can only hypothesize a solution based on common practices for resolving such issues in Django admin. If the `Question` model is supposed to have a relation to `Choice` that needs to be displayed in the admin interface, and assuming the relation is not directly called `choice` or is not straightforward to display, we would typically implement a method in `QuestionAdmin` to handle this.

However, since the direct approach and the hypothetical patch did not align with the actual issue, and without further specific details on the `list_display` configuration or the exact nature of the `choice` reference, providing another patch without more accurate context may not be productive.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the `Question` and `Choice` model definitions to understand their relationship.
- Confirming the intended items to be displayed in `QuestionAdmin`'s `list_display` and ensuring they are correctly referenced.
- Verifying any custom methods or properties in `Question` or `QuestionAdmin` intended for use in `list_display`.

Without the ability to directly query more information or inspect the models and admin configuration further, we've reached the limit of how we can address the issue based on the provided context and the constraints of this interaction format.
