This patch addresses the issue by adding a check in the `distinct` method to see if the queryset is a result of a combination operation like `union`. If `distinct` is called with field names on such a queryset, it raises a `NotImplementedError`, as supporting distinct field names on combined querysets would require a more complex implementation. If no field names are provided, it applies the `distinct` operation to each of the combined queries. This approach ensures that the `distinct` method behaves more predictably after a `union` operation, while also making it clear that using `distinct` with field names on combined querysets is not supported.
