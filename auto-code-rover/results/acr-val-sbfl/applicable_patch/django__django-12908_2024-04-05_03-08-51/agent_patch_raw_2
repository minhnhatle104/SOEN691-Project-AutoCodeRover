Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the issue as expected, let's consider a different approach. The problem seems to stem from the fact that `.distinct('field_name')` does not work as expected when applied to a queryset resulting from a `.union()` operation. This could be due to how the underlying SQL is generated for such queries, particularly because distinct on specific fields after a union might not be directly supported in the way Django constructs the query.

A more robust solution might involve ensuring that the `.distinct()` method can intelligently handle querysets resulting from `.union()`, especially when field-specific distinctness is requested. However, given the constraints and the initial failure, a simpler and more direct approach might be to ensure that the `.distinct()` call is properly applied to the combined queryset in a way that the database can understand and execute correctly.

Let's attempt a patch that focuses on enhancing the `.union()` method to better support subsequent `.distinct()` calls, especially with field names. This approach involves modifying the `_combinator_query` method used within `union` to ensure it correctly sets up the combined queryset for subsequent distinct operations.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>
<original>    def union(self, *other_qs, all=False):
        # If the query is an EmptyQuerySet, combine all nonempty querysets.
        if isinstance(self, EmptyQuerySet):
            qs = [q for q in other_qs if not isinstance(q, EmptyQuerySet)]
            return qs[0]._combinator_query('union', *qs[1:], all=all) if qs else self
        return self._combinator_query('union', *other_qs, all=all)
</original>
<patched>    def union(self, *other_qs, all=False):
        # Enhanced to ensure compatibility with subsequent distinct calls, especially with field names.
        combined_qs = super(QuerySet, self).none()
        if isinstance(self, EmptyQuerySet):
            qs = [q for q in other_qs if not isinstance(q, EmptyQuerySet)]
            if qs:
                combined_qs = qs[0]._combinator_query('union', *qs[1:], all=all)
        else:
            combined_qs = self._combinator_query('union', *other_qs, all=all)
        
        # Apply distinct directly if 'all' is False to ensure distinct behavior is preserved.
        if not all:
            combined_qs.query.add_distinct_fields()
        return combined_qs
</patched>
```

This patch attempts to directly address the issue by modifying the `union` method to ensure that the resulting queryset is properly set up for distinct operations. The key change is ensuring that if `all` is `False`, which implies that duplicates should not be included in the union result, the `add_distinct_fields` method is called without field names to apply a general distinct operation. This should help ensure that subsequent calls to `.distinct()` with field names are more likely to behave as expected, by setting up the queryset in a way that's more compatible with such operations.

Please note, this patch is a conceptual solution aimed at addressing the described issue. Actual implementation and testing might require adjustments based on the specific behaviors of Django's ORM and the underlying database engine's capabilities regarding union and distinct operations.
