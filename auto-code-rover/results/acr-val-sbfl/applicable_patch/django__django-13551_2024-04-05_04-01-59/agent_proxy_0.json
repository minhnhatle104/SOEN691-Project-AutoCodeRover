            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class and its methods work, especially in relation to generating and checking password reset tokens. Since the issue description suggests modifying the `_make_hash_value()` method to include the user's email address, it's crucial to examine this method and related ones to understand their current implementation and how they can be modified to incorporate the suggested changes.\n\nGiven the information from the issue and the external analysis tool, I will perform the following search API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: This will help us understand the structure of the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class, including all its methods and how they interact with each other.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_make_hash_value\", \"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: Since the issue suggests modifying this method, it's important to see its current implementation to understand how to incorporate the user's email address into the token generation process.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"check_token\", \"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: This method is crucial for understanding how tokens are currently validated. Modifying the token generation process might require changes here as well.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"make_token\", \"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: This method is responsible for generating the password reset tokens. Understanding its current implementation will help in modifying it to include the user's email address in the token generation process.\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive understanding of how password reset tokens are generated and validated in the project, which is essential for addressing the issue at hand."
