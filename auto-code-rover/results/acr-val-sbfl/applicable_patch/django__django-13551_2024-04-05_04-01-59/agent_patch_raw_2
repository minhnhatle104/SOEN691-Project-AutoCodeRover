Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's crucial to revisit the implementation details and ensure compatibility with the existing system. A potential oversight could be the handling of users without an email address, as mentioned in the issue description. Let's adjust the patch to account for this scenario and ensure robustness.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>
<original>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):
        """
        Hash the user's primary key and some user state that's sure to change
        after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it's
        used:
        1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
           same password is chosen, due to password salting).
        2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after
           a password reset.
        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
        invalidates the token.

        Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking
        attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn't compromised.
        """
        # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the
        # database doesn't support microseconds.
        login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)</original>
<patched>    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):
        """
        Hash the user's primary key, email (if available), and some user state that's sure to change

        1. The email field will change upon an email address change, contributing to token invalidation.
        2. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
           same password is chosen, due to password salting).

        login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        email = user.email if hasattr(user, 'email') else ''
        return str(user.pk) + email + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)</patched>
```

This revised modification includes a check to ensure that the user object has an email attribute before attempting to use it in the hash value. This adjustment is made to accommodate user models that might not have an email field, thus addressing the potential issue that could have caused the tests to fail previously. By including this check, the patch aims to enhance security without compromising compatibility with different user models.
