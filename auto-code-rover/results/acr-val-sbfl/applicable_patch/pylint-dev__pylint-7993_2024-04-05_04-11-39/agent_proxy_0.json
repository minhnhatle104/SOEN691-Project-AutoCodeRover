            "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to investigate how the message template functionality is implemented and how it interacts with the rest of the Pylint codebase. Given the information from the issue and the external analysis tool, I will focus on the `TextReporter` class and its `on_set_current_module` method, as it seems directly related to the handling of message templates. Additionally, I'll look into how message definitions are managed, as the problem might also involve how message templates are parsed or recognized.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"on_set_current_module\", \"TextReporter\")` - This will help understand how the `TextReporter` class handles setting the current module and potentially how it processes message templates.\n\n2. `search_class(\"MessageDefinitionStore\")` - Since the issue might be related to how message definitions are recognized or retrieved, understanding this class will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms.\n\n3. `search_code(\"--msg-template\")` - This will help find where and how the `--msg-template` argument is parsed and used within the Pylint codebase, which could lead to the root cause of the issue.\n\nThese API calls are chosen to directly address the components mentioned in the issue and the external analysis tool's output, aiming to cover both the symptom (message template processing) and potential underlying causes (message definition handling)."
