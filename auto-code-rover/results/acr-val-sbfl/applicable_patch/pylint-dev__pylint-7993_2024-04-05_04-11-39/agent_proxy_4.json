            "content": "Given the feedback and the analysis conducted so far, it appears that the identified bug location and the understanding of the issue are accurate based on the information provided. The `TextReporter.on_set_current_module` method within the `pylint/reporters/text.py` file is where the issue with handling custom braces in the message template arises. This method's logic for parsing template arguments and validating them against `MESSAGE_FIELDS` does not accommodate custom braces, leading to the observed issue.\n\nHowever, since further precision in identifying the bug location is requested, but no additional specific directions for further context have been provided, it seems we have reached the extent of the analysis possible with the given information and tools. The analysis points towards the need for a modification in how the `TextReporter.on_set_current_module` method handles message template arguments, particularly with respect to custom braces.\n\nWithout additional specific queries or directions for further exploration within the codebase, the next logical step would be to proceed with drafting a solution based on the current understanding of the issue. This would involve adjusting the argument parsing and validation logic within the identified method to correctly handle custom braces in message templates."
