Given the constraints and the need to accurately address the issue without altering the original program in a way that doesn't match, let's focus on a more precise and minimal change that directly addresses the problem of recognizing and handling custom braces in message templates without introducing additional changes that might conflict with the existing logic of the `TextReporter.on_set_current_module` method.

```python
<file>pylint/reporters/text.py</file>
<original>        arguments = re.findall(r"\{(.+?)(:.*)?\}", template)
        for argument in arguments:
            if argument[0] not in MESSAGE_FIELDS:
                warnings.warn(
                    f"Don't recognize the argument '{argument[0]}' in the --msg-template. "
                    "Are you sure it is supported on the current version of pylint?"
                )
                template = re.sub(r"\{" + argument[0] + r"(:.*?)?\}", "", template)</original>
<patched>        # Modified to correctly handle custom braces by adjusting the regex pattern
        arguments = re.findall(r"\{\{(.+?)(:.*)?\}\}", template)
        for argument in arguments:
            if argument[0] not in MESSAGE_FIELDS:
                warnings.warn(
                    f"Don't recognize the argument '{argument[0]}' in the --msg-template. "
                    "Are you sure it is supported on the current version of pylint?"
                )
                # Adjusting the removal process to handle custom braces correctly
                template = re.sub(r"\{\{" + argument[0] + r"(:.*?)?\}\}", "", template)</patched>
```

This modification aims to directly address the issue with handling custom braces (`{{` and `}}`) in the message template. By adjusting the regular expression used to find arguments within the template, this patch specifically targets arguments enclosed within double braces, which aligns with the user's intention to use custom braces in their message template. The removal process is also adjusted to match this new pattern, ensuring that only the intended parts of the template are affected when unrecognized arguments are encountered. This approach minimizes changes to the existing logic while directly addressing the reported issue.
