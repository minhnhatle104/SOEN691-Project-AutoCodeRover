            "content": "Given the feedback, it seems necessary to refine the understanding of the bug's location and possibly gather more context to ensure the precision of the bug location. To achieve this, I will focus on the handling and parsing of the `--msg-template` argument within the `TextReporter` class, as it's directly related to the issue described. Additionally, examining how custom braces are managed across the codebase could provide insights into potential mismatches or oversights in the current implementation.\n\nTo refine the bug location and gather more context, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"--msg-template\", \"pylint/reporters/text.py\")` - This will help to understand specifically how the `--msg-template` argument is handled within the `TextReporter` file, focusing on parsing and validation logic that could be affecting the recognition of custom braces.\n\n2. `search_code(\"MESSAGE_FIELDS\")` - Since the `MESSAGE_FIELDS` variable is used to validate the fields within the message template, understanding its definition and usage across the codebase could provide insights into potential limitations or issues with the current implementation of template parsing.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a more detailed understanding of how message templates are processed and validated, specifically focusing on the handling of custom braces and the role of `MESSAGE_FIELDS` in this process."
