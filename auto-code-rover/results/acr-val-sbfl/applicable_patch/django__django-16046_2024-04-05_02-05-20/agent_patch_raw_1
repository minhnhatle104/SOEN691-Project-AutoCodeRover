<file>django/utils/numberformat.py</file>
<original>if str_number[0] == "-":
    sign = "-"
    str_number = str_number[1:]</original>
<patched>if str_number and str_number[0] == "-":
    sign = "-"
    str_number = str_number[1:]</patched>
```

This patch ensures that before attempting to access the first character of `str_number` to check if it is a negative sign, the code first checks if `str_number` is not empty. This prevents the `IndexError: string index out of range` when `str_number` is an empty string, which can occur if `number` is `None` or an empty string initially passed to the `format` function.
