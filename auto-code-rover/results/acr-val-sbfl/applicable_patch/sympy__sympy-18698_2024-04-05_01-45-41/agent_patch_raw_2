Given the constraints and without a specific identifiable bug in the provided code snippets, creating a precise and applicable patch is challenging. The issue described suggests a problem with the handling or interpretation of multiplicities in the square-free factorization process, but the provided code does not directly reveal a flaw in the logic or implementation that could lead to the observed inconsistency.

In real-world software development, the next steps would typically involve a deeper investigation, including:
- Reviewing the algorithm implemented in `dmp_sqf_list` to ensure it correctly computes the square-free decomposition and the multiplicities of each factor.
- Debugging the function with specific inputs that lead to the incorrect output, as described in the issue.
- Adding or enhancing unit tests to cover cases similar to the one described in the issue, to ensure that any changes made address the problem without introducing new issues.

Without the ability to perform these steps or more detailed insight into the specific cause of the issue, proposing a direct and accurate patch is not feasible. The resolution would likely involve correcting how multiplicities are calculated, aggregated, or interpreted in the `dmp_sqf_list` function or ensuring that the results are correctly processed and formatted in the `sqf_list` methods in `polyclasses.py` and `polytools.py`.

In the absence of a specific bug or further details, I recommend:
- Revisiting the algorithm in `dmp_sqf_list` for potential logical errors or assumptions that might not hold in all cases, particularly in how it handles the computation and aggregation of multiplicities.
- Ensuring that the `sqf_list` methods in both `polyclasses.py` and `polytools.py` correctly interpret and format the output of `dmp_sqf_list`, especially in edge cases that might lead to the observed inconsistency.

This scenario underscores the importance of thorough testing and debugging in software maintenance and the challenges of diagnosing and resolving issues based on limited information.
