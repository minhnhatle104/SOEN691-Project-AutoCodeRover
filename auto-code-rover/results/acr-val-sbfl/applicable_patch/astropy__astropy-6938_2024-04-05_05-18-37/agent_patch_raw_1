```python
<file>astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py</file>
<original>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</original>
<patched>        if 'D' in format:
            output_field[:] = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring the result of the `replace` operation is assigned back to `output_field`, thus applying the intended replacement of 'E' with 'D' in the exponent part of floating-point numbers. This change ensures that the modifications are correctly reflected in the `output_field` array.
