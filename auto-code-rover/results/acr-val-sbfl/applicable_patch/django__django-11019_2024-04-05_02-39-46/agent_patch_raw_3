Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that the approach to patching the issue needs to be reconsidered. The challenge lies in accurately resolving the order of media files without introducing specific dependency checks that could fail under various conditions or configurations. A more generalized solution that improves the order resolution logic without making assumptions about file naming or explicit dependencies might be the key to addressing the issue effectively.

Considering the core problem is the generation of unnecessary `MediaOrderConflictWarning` due to the perceived but not actual conflict in the order of media files, a refined approach could involve enhancing the merge logic to better handle cases where media files are indeed in the correct order because of their usage across different widgets or forms.

Let's propose a new patch that focuses on refining the merge logic to reduce false positives in conflict detection, without relying on explicit dependency checks or naming conventions.

                    warnings.warn(
                        'Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\n'
                        '%s\n%s' % (combined_list[last_insert_index], combined_list[index]),
                        MediaOrderConflictWarning,
                    )
                # path already exists in the list. Update last_insert_index so
                # that the following elements are inserted in front of this one.
                last_insert_index = index</original>
<patched>                if index > last_insert_index:
                    # Adjust the condition to reduce false positives by checking the relative order
                    # in the original lists as well. This aims to account for cases where the order
                    # in list_1 and list_2 is consistent with the required dependencies.
                    order_conflict = True
                    if list_1.index(path) if path in list_1 else None == index and \
                       list_2.index(path) if path in list_2 else None == last_insert_index:
                        order_conflict = False
                    if order_conflict:
                        warnings.warn(
                            'Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\n'
                            '%s\n%s' % (combined_list[last_insert_index], combined_list[index]),
                            MediaOrderConflictWarning,
                        )
                last_insert_index = index</patched>
```

**Explanation**: This patch attempts to refine the conflict detection logic within the `merge` method. Instead of directly issuing a warning when a media file appears in a different order relative to the last insert index, it first checks if the perceived conflict aligns with the original order of the media files in `list_1` and `list_2`. This additional check aims to identify if the order in the merged list actually reflects a consistent ordering across the original lists, which might indicate that the detected conflict is not a genuine issue. This approach seeks to reduce false positives in conflict warnings by considering the context in which the media files are used across different widgets or forms, without making assumptions about their dependencies.
