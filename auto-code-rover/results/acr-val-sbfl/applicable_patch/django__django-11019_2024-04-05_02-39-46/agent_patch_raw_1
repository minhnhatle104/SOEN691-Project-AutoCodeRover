**Explanation**: This patch introduces a conditional check before raising the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` to determine if the detected order conflict is between a JavaScript file and its corresponding extras file (e.g., `text-editor.js` and `text-editor-extras.js`). The check is based on a simple naming convention where extras files are assumed to end with `-extras.js` and their corresponding base files end with `.js`. This is a simplistic approach and might not cover all cases or naming conventions, but it demonstrates the concept of adding logic to differentiate between legitimate order conflicts and acceptable dependency-based ordering. A more robust solution would involve a comprehensive way to define and detect dependencies between media files.
