Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's possible that the approach to hashing might need reconsideration, especially if `self.instance` is not always hashable or if its hashability does not align with how `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances are expected to be compared or used within sets and dictionaries.

A more robust approach might involve re-evaluating what constitutes the unique identity of a `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instance. If `self.value` is always hashable and uniquely identifies the instance in the context where hashability is required, we could consider basing the hash solely on `self.value`. This approach simplifies the hash function and might avoid issues related to the hashability of `self.instance`.

Let's revise the patch with this consideration:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/models.py</file>
<original>class ModelChoiceIteratorValue:
    def __init__(self, value, instance):
        self.value = value
        self.instance = instance

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, ModelChoiceIteratorValue):
            other = other.value
        return self.value == other
</original>
<patched>class ModelChoiceIteratorValue:
    def __init__(self, value, instance):
        self.value = value
        self.instance = instance

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, ModelChoiceIteratorValue):
            other = other.value
        return self.value == other

    def __hash__(self):
        # Revised hash function to only consider self.value
        return hash(self.value)
</patched>
```

This revision assumes that `self.value` is sufficient for uniquely identifying `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances in the contexts where they are used, which should be validated against the specific requirements and usage patterns within the Django project. This change aims to ensure that the instances are hashable while potentially avoiding the complications that led to test failures with the initial patch.
