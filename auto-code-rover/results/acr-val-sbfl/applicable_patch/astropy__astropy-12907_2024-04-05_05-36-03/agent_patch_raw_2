Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, it's clear that a more nuanced approach is needed, especially considering how nested `CompoundModels` are handled in the `_separable` function. The initial patch attempted to directly address the combination of separability matrices but might have oversimplified the handling of compound operations or missed other underlying issues.

Upon further reflection, the core issue seems to lie not just in how the separability matrices are combined but also in ensuring that the separability of each part of a nested compound model is correctly determined and represented. A more robust solution would involve ensuring that the separability matrix accurately reflects the separability of all inputs and outputs across nested models.

Given the constraints and the need for a more comprehensive solution, let's propose a revised approach that focuses on improving the logic within the `_separable` function to better handle nested structures. This approach will ensure that the separability determination logic more accurately reflects the structure and behavior of nested compound models.

```python
<file>astropy/modeling/separable.py</file>
<original>elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
        sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
        sepright = _separable(transform.right)
        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)</original>
<patched>elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
        # Improved handling for nested CompoundModels
        sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
        sepright = _separable(transform.right)
        if transform.op == '&':
            # For '&' operation, ensure correct handling of nested models by combining matrices directly
            combined_separability = np.logical_and(sepleft, sepright)
        elif transform.op == '|':
            # For '|' operation, the separability should consider the union of separable outputs
            combined_separability = np.logical_or(sepleft, sepright)
        else:
            # Placeholder for additional compound operations handling
            combined_separability = _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)
        return combined_separability</patched>
```

This revised patch takes a more cautious approach to handling the logical operations within nested `CompoundModels`. It explicitly handles the '&' and '|' operations, which are common in compound models, by applying logical AND and OR operations, respectively, to the separability matrices of the left and right models. This approach aims to more accurately reflect the intended separability behavior for compound models, especially when nested.

This patch is a conceptual proposal based on the provided context and understanding of the issue. It's important to thoroughly test this change with various compound model configurations to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems. Further adjustments may be necessary based on those test results and any additional insights gained during the testing process.
