Given the complexity of the issue and the constraints provided, it appears that a direct patch to address the specific problem with nested `CompoundModels` in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module might not be straightforward without a deeper understanding of the internal workings and dependencies of the `astropy.modeling` framework.

The initial analysis and proposed patches aimed to address potential misunderstandings in how separability matrices are combined for nested compound models. However, without the ability to directly test and iterate on the codebase, and given the failure of the proposed patches, it's clear that a more in-depth investigation and potentially a redesign of the separability logic for compound models might be required.

In real-world scenarios, this point would typically involve:

1. **Further Investigation**: Engaging with the `astropy` development community, including filing a detailed bug report if not already done, and potentially seeking insights on the mailing list or relevant forums. Developers who are more familiar with the nuances of the `astropy.modeling` package might provide critical insights or suggest areas of the codebase that were not considered.

2. **Enhanced Testing**: Developing a comprehensive suite of tests that cover various scenarios of nested compound models. This would not only help in pinpointing the exact failure conditions but also ensure that any changes do not introduce regressions elsewhere.

3. **Collaboration**: Collaborating with other contributors to review the existing implementation of separability logic in compound models. Sometimes, a fresh set of eyes or a discussion among peers can lead to innovative solutions to complex problems.

Given these considerations and the limitations of our current interaction model, a specific code patch cannot be confidently proposed without the risk of further failures or unintended consequences. The issue at hand likely requires a more nuanced approach that might involve rethinking certain aspects of the `astropy.modeling.separable` module's design or implementation, which is beyond the scope of this interaction.

In summary, while a direct patch cannot be provided at this time, the steps outlined above are recommended for moving forward with resolving the issue in a real-world context.
