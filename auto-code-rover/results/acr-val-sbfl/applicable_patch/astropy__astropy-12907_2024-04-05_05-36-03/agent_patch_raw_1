Given the context and the identified issue with the handling of nested `CompoundModels` in the `_separable` function, a potential patch could involve ensuring that the separability of nested compound models is correctly computed and aggregated. The issue seems to stem from how the separability of the left and right parts of a compound model are combined. Specifically, for nested compound models, the current logic may not correctly handle the separability matrix's aggregation, leading to incorrect assumptions about input and output separability.

Here's a proposed patch to address this issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>astropy/modeling/separable.py</file>
<original>elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
        sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
        sepright = _separable(transform.right)
        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)</original>
<patched>elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
        sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
        sepright = _separable(transform.right)
        # Ensure correct aggregation of separability for nested compound models
        if transform.op == '&':
            # For the '&' operation, combine separability matrices by logical AND along the corresponding dimensions
            return np.logical_and(sepleft, sepright)
        elif transform.op == '|':
            # For the '|' operation, combine separability matrices appropriately (this may require additional logic based on the operation's semantics)
            return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)
        else:
            # Handle other operations or raise an error/not implemented warning as appropriate
            raise NotImplementedError(f"Operation '{transform.op}' not supported for separability determination.")</patched>
```

This patch introduces a more nuanced handling of the '&' and '|' operations within nested `CompoundModels`. It explicitly checks for these operations and applies a logical AND for the '&' operation, ensuring that the outputs are considered separable only if they are separable in both the left and right parts of the compound model. For the '|' operation and others, the patch suggests that additional logic may be required, or a NotImplementedError could be raised to indicate unsupported operations for separability determination.

This is a starting point for addressing the issue. Further testing and refinement may be needed, especially to handle other operations (`'|'`, etc.) correctly and to ensure that the patch does not introduce regressions for other use cases.
