                # Correctly handle dimensionless exponents for expressions like exp
                return factor ** exp_factor, Dimension(1)

Explanation:
The patch addresses the issue where the dimension of the exponent in expressions like `exp` was not correctly handled as dimensionless. By checking if the exponent's dimension is dimensionless and then explicitly returning `Dimension(1)` for the dimension part of the tuple, we ensure that expressions with a dimensionless exponent are correctly interpreted as such. This approach avoids the incorrect application of dimensions to the result of operations like `exp`, which expect dimensionless exponents.
