            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `Permutation` constructor currently handles cycles, especially non-disjoint cycles, and how it should be modified to achieve the desired behavior. Given the information from the external analysis tool, it seems prudent to start by examining the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class, as this is likely where the constructor logic resides that needs to be adjusted. Additionally, understanding the current implementation of cycle handling might require looking into the `Cycle` class's `__init__` method.\n\nTherefore, I will use the following search API calls to gather more context about the implementation:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"__new__\", \"Permutation\")` - This will help us understand how the `Permutation` constructor currently processes the input cycles.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Cycle\")` - This will provide insight into how cycles are initialized, which might be relevant for handling non-disjoint cycles."
