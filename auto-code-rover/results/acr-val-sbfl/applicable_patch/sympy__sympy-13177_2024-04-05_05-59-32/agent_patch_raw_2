Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it appears that the approach needs to be refined. The core of the problem seems to be with how the `Mod` function itself handles cases where the base of a power is not an integer, rather than how expressions are passed to `Mod`. Since the direct manipulation of `__mod__`, `__rmod__`, and `as_base_exp` did not yield the desired outcome, a more targeted approach towards adjusting the `Mod` function's evaluation logic is necessary.

However, based on the information provided, we do not have direct access to the implementation details of the `Mod` function itself within the provided context. The initial assumption was to adjust how expressions are handled before they are passed to `Mod`, but it seems the issue lies deeper within the `Mod` function's logic for handling non-integer bases in power expressions.

Given this, a hypothetical patch would involve adding a check within the `Mod` function to correctly handle cases where the base of a power is not an integer. Unfortunately, without direct access to the `Mod` function's implementation from the provided context, the following patch is speculative and aims to illustrate the concept of what such a fix might look like:

# Hypothetical modification (conceptual)
```python
<file>sympy/core/mod.py</file>  # Hypothetical file and location
<original>
# Hypothetical original implementation of the Mod function
</original>
<patched>
def Mod(p, q, evaluate=False):
    from sympy.core.power import Pow
    from sympy import S
    
    # Check if p is a power and q is its base or a multiple thereof
    if isinstance(p, Pow) and p.base.is_real and p.exp.is_Integer:
        if p.base == q or (q.is_real and (p.base % q == 0)):
            return S.Zero
        # Additional check for non-integer bases
        elif not p.base.is_integer:
            # Handle the case where the base is not an integer
            # This is a conceptual patch; the actual implementation may vary
            return (p.base ** p.exp) % q
    # Fallback to the original Mod logic if none of the above conditions are met
    return original_Mod_logic(p, q, evaluate)
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch adds logic to handle cases where the base of a power (`p.base`) is not an integer, which was the core issue. It checks if the base is real and not an integer, and then applies the modulo operation directly to the result of the power expression, rather than assuming it would be zero.

Please note, this patch is speculative and intended to illustrate the approach towards a solution. The actual implementation may require access to the `Mod` function's code and thorough testing to ensure compatibility with the wide range of expressions SymPy handles.
