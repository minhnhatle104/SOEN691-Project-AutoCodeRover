# modification 3
```python
<file>sympy/core/function.py</file>
<original>    def as_base_exp(self):
        """
        Returns the method as the 2-tuple (base, exponent).
        """
        return self, S.One
</original>
<patched>    def as_base_exp(self):
        """
        Returns the method as the 2-tuple (base, exponent).
        """
        from sympy import S
        # Ensure that the base is treated correctly as an integer or a float
        if self.is_integer or (self.is_Float and self.is_number):
            return self, S.One
        else:
            return super(Function, self).as_base_exp()
</patched>
```

Note: For the third modification, the logic added aims to address the issue by ensuring that the base is correctly identified as an integer or a float, which is relevant to the problem described. However, without the ability to test the patch in the actual SymPy environment and considering the complexity of symbolic computation, further adjustments and testing would likely be necessary to fully resolve the issue.
