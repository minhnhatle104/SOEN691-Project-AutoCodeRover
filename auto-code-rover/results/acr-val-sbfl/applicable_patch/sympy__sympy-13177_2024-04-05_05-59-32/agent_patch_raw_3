Given the constraints and the feedback received, it's clear that a direct patch to the `Mod` function or related methods without access to the specific implementation details of `Mod` is challenging. The initial approach attempted to address the issue through modifications in the handling of expressions and the `Mod` operation within the `Expr` and `Function` classes. However, without direct visibility into the `Mod` function's implementation and considering the feedback, it's evident that speculative patches cannot be accurately formulated.

The issue at hand involves the `Mod` function not always returning 0 for `Mod(x**2, x)` when `x` is not an integer, which suggests a deeper logic flaw in handling non-integer bases within power expressions in the modulo operation. The correct approach would likely involve adjusting the internal logic of the `Mod` function to better handle these cases, ensuring that it can accurately determine when to return 0 based on the properties of the base and exponent in power expressions.

Without the ability to directly access and modify the `Mod` function's code or without further details on its implementation, providing a concrete and applicable patch is not feasible. The resolution to this issue would require a detailed review and modification of the `Mod` function's handling of power expressions with non-integer bases, potentially involving a more nuanced check of the base and exponent's properties before deciding on the return value.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Implementation of `Mod`**: Directly accessing the source code of the `Mod` function to understand its current logic for handling power expressions and identifying where it fails to account for non-integer bases.

2. **Developing a Test Suite**: Creating a comprehensive set of test cases that cover various scenarios, including integer and non-integer bases, to ensure any modifications to the `Mod` function do not introduce regressions or unintended behavior.

3. **Iterative Development and Testing**: Making targeted adjustments to the `Mod` function's logic to correctly handle the identified issue, followed by rigorous testing against the developed test suite to confirm the resolution of the issue and the maintenance of expected functionality across the board.

Without the specific implementation details of the `Mod` function and the ability to test changes within the actual codebase, providing a detailed and accurate patch is not possible in this context.
