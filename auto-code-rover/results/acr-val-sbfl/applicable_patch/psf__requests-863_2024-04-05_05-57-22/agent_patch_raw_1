<original>    def register_hook(self, event, hook):
        """Properly register a hook."""

        self.hooks[event].append(hook)

<patched>    def register_hook(self, event, hook):
        """Properly register a hook or a list of hooks."""

        if isinstance(hook, list):
            self.hooks[event].extend(hook)

# modification 2
```python
<file>requests/models.py</file>
<original>        hooks = hooks or {}

        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)
</original>
<patched>        hooks = hooks or {}

        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            # This allows for both single hook functions and lists of hook functions to be registered.
            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)
</patched>
```
The second modification is more of a clarification than a change in code. The actual functional change is in the `register_hook` method, which now can handle both single hooks and lists of hooks. This modification ensures that the intent and capability of handling lists of hooks are clear, aligning with the changes made to the `register_hook` method.
