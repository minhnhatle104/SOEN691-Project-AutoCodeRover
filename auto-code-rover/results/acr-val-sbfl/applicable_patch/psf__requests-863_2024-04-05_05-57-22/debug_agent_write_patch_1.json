If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n</issue>"

This analysis will help us address the issue described.\n\n### Analysis of `__init__` Method\nThe `__init__` method of the `Request` class takes several arguments, including `hooks`. The relevant steps for handling the `hooks` argument are as follows:\n- Initially, an empty dictionary is assigned to `self.hooks`.\n- For each event in a predefined list of hooks (`HOOKS`), an empty list is assigned to `self.hooks[event]`.\n- The `hooks` argument provided to `__init__` is expected to be a dictionary. For each key-value pair in this dictionary, `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` is called.\n\n### Analysis of `register_hook` Method\nThe `register_hook` method takes two arguments: `event` and `hook`. It appends the `hook` to the list of hooks for the given `event` in `self.hooks[event]`.\n\n### Identified Issue\nThe issue arises when the `hooks` argument provided to the `__init__` method contains lists of hook functions for each event. The current implementation of `__init__` and `register_hook` does not account for the possibility of the `hook` being a list. Instead, it treats each `hook` as a single callable, leading to the problem described: when a list of hook functions is provided, it is wrapped in another list, causing failures when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nTo resolve this issue, we need to modify the `register_hook` method to accept both single callables and lists of callables for each event. Additionally, we should adjust the loop in the `__init__` method that processes the `hooks` argument to correctly handle lists of hooks.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Modify the `register_hook` method to check if the `hook` argument is a list and, if so, extend the list of hooks for the event instead of appending.\n- Ensure the loop in the `__init__` method that iterates over the `hooks` argument properly handles lists of hooks.\n\nThis solution will allow users to specify multiple hook functions per event in the `hooks` argument, addressing the issue described."
