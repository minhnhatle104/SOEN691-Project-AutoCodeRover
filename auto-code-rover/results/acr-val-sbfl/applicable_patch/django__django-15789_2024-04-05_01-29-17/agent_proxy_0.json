            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how `django.utils.html.json_script` is currently implemented, especially how it handles JSON encoding. Since the issue mentions that the JSON encoder is hardcoded to `DjangoJSONEncoder`, it would be beneficial to look at the implementation of `json_script` to confirm this and to understand the current structure. Additionally, checking if there's any documentation or mention of `json_script` in the codebase could provide insights into why it's not documented and how it's intended to be used.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. `search_method(\"json_script\")`: This will help us find where `json_script` is defined and understand its current implementation, particularly how it handles JSON encoding.\n\n2. `search_class(\"DjangoJSONEncoder\")`: Since the issue mentions that `DjangoJSONEncoder` is hardcoded, understanding how this class is implemented will be crucial for allowing the use of a custom encoder.\n\n3. `search_code(\"django.utils.html.json_script\")`: This search could help us find any comments or undocumented usage of `json_script` within the codebase, which could be relevant for adding documentation.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of how `json_script` is implemented and how it interacts with `DjangoJSONEncoder`, as well as any existing discussions or comments about its documentation."
