Given the constraints and the information provided, it's clear that crafting an effective patch requires a deep understanding of Django's ORM, SQLite's limitations, and the specific context of the error. Without direct access to the underlying issue or more detailed error logs pinpointing the misuse of the "." operator in index expressions, proposing a precise and effective patch is challenging.

However, reflecting on the error message and the Django ORM's behavior, the issue seems to revolve around the handling of unique constraints during the table alteration process in SQLite. SQLite has known limitations with ALTER TABLE operations, requiring a workaround that involves creating a new table, copying data, dropping the old table, and renaming the new table to the old name. The error message suggests that during this process, an index expression is being formed incorrectly, possibly due to how Django's ORM constructs SQL statements for unique constraints.

Given this understanding, a more general approach to addressing such issues in Django, especially when dealing with database backends with specific limitations like SQLite, involves ensuring that the ORM's SQL generation logic correctly accounts for these limitations. This might involve revisiting the ORM's assumptions about SQL syntax compatibility across different database backends and implementing backend-specific logic where necessary.

Since a precise patch cannot be proposed without further insights into the specific cause of the error, the following steps are recommended for developers facing similar issues:

1. **Debugging and Logging**: Enhance logging around the SQL generation and execution process, especially in the parts of the ORM dealing with schema alterations and constraint handling. This can help identify the exact point of failure and the malformed SQL statement.

2. **Review Django and SQLite Documentation**: Review the latest Django documentation and SQLite's limitations regarding ALTER TABLE operations and unique constraints. This can provide clues about potential mismatches between Django's SQL generation logic and SQLite's capabilities.

3. **Engage with the Django Community**: Share the issue, including detailed logs and observations, with the Django community through forums, issue trackers, or mailing lists. The community can offer valuable insights, and the issue might have been encountered and addressed in newer Django versions or ongoing discussions.

4. **Patch Submission and Testing**: If a solution is identified, whether through community engagement or further debugging, ensure thorough testing across multiple environments and SQLite versions. Given the complexity of database schema alterations, changes should be carefully evaluated to avoid introducing regressions.

In summary, while a direct patch cannot be confidently proposed without additional diagnostic information, the steps outlined above offer a pathway for identifying and addressing complex issues related to database schema changes in Django, particularly for backends like SQLite with unique limitations.
