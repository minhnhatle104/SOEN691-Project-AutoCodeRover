Given the complexity of the issue and the lack of a clear, identifiable misuse of the "." operator in the provided code snippets, crafting a precise patch without further diagnostic information or a deeper dive into the Django ORM's internals and how it constructs SQL queries for SQLite is challenging. The error suggests a problem with the SQL generated for handling unique constraints during the table remaking process, specifically an incorrect use of the "." operator in index expressions, which SQLite does not support in the context described.

Without a specific line or operation where the misuse occurs, and based on the information provided, it's difficult to propose a targeted patch. The issue likely lies in the deeper mechanics of how Django's ORM constructs SQL statements for SQLite, particularly around unique constraints and possibly the renaming or altering of fields within those constraints.

A more effective approach to resolving this issue would involve:

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Temporarily adding detailed logging around the SQL generation and execution processes in the `_remake_table` method and related operations. This could help pinpoint the exact SQL statement causing the issue.

2. **Reviewing SQLite Limitations**: A thorough review of SQLite's documentation regarding unique constraints, index expressions, and ALTER TABLE operations. This could provide insights into limitations or behaviors that Django's ORM might not fully account for.

3. **Consulting Django's Issue Tracker and Community**: Searching Django's issue tracker for similar issues or reaching out to the Django community for insights. Sometimes, issues of this nature have been encountered and discussed, if not formally resolved, within the community.

Given these considerations, a direct patch cannot be confidently proposed without further information. However, for the sake of providing a speculative direction based on common issues related to database schema changes in Django, here's a hypothetical approach focusing on ensuring that unique constraints are correctly rebuilt during the `_remake_table` process, acknowledging that this is speculative and not based on a specific identified bug in the provided snippets:

# Speculative modification
```python
<file>django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py</file>
<original># Rename the new table to take way for the old
self.alter_db_table(
    new_model, new_model._meta.db_table, model._meta.db_table,
    disable_constraints=False,
)</original>
<patched># Before renaming the new table, explicitly drop and recreate unique constraints to avoid potential issues with index expressions
# This is a speculative patch and should be adapted based on the actual SQL generation logic that needs correction
for constraint in constraints:
    if isinstance(constraint, models.UniqueConstraint):
        self._delete_constraint(model, constraint.name)
        self._create_unique_sql(model, constraint.fields, constraint.name)

# Rename the new table to take way for the old
self.alter_db_table(
    new_model, new_model._meta.db_table, model._meta.db_table,
    disable_constraints=False,
)</patched>
```

This speculative modification suggests explicitly handling unique constraints by dropping and recreating them around the table renaming operation, hypothesizing that the issue might relate to how unique constraints are managed during the table remaking process. This approach is based on general practices for dealing with database schema changes and should be carefully reviewed and tested, as it might not directly address the specific issue without further diagnostic information.
