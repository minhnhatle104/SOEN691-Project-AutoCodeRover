Given the constraints and the complexity of the issue, it's clear that a direct intervention in the substitution or simplification process might not be straightforward without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of SymPy, especially regarding how expressions are evaluated and simplified.

The issue at hand involves the mathematical handling of expressions that become undefined due to division by zero when substitutions are made. The core of the problem seems to be that the library does not properly handle or recognize the situation where a substitution leads to a division by zero, thus producing an incorrect result instead of indicating the expression is undefined or indeterminate.

Given the nature of symbolic computation and the examples provided, a more accurate approach would involve ensuring that the library can detect and correctly handle cases where substitutions result in divisions by zero. This could potentially be addressed by improving the checks during the evaluation of expressions involving divisions.

However, without the ability to directly modify and test the SymPy codebase, I can only suggest a conceptual approach that might guide the development of a patch.

### Conceptual Patch

The goal would be to modify the evaluation logic for division operations to ensure that cases leading to division by zero are correctly handled as undefined or indeterminate. This would likely involve modifications to the division operation's handling in SymPy, specifically where the denominator can become zero due to substitutions.

Since the direct code modifications cannot be provided, here's a conceptual outline of the approach:

1. **Enhance Division Evaluation Logic**: Modify the logic that evaluates division operations (`__truediv__` in Python 3) to include checks for conditions where the denominator becomes zero due to a substitution. This logic should be sensitive to substitutions that have not yet been evaluated, which might require leveraging SymPy's capabilities for symbolic analysis.

2. **Introduce Undefined or Indeterminate Handling**: When a division by zero is detected, especially after a substitution, the operation should return an `Undefined` or `Indeterminate` expression, depending on SymPy's existing conventions for handling such cases.

3. **Improve Substitution Logic**: Ensure that the substitution logic (`subs` method) is capable of recognizing when a substitution will lead to a division by zero in any part of an expression. This might involve symbolic pre-evaluation of the expression with the proposed substitution to identify potential issues.

### Final Note

Implementing the above conceptual approach would require a detailed understanding of SymPy's internals, particularly how expressions are parsed, evaluated, and simplified. It would also necessitate a thorough testing process to ensure that the changes do not introduce regressions or affect the library's performance for other use cases.

This issue highlights the challenges in symbolic computation, especially in handling edge cases involving undefined or indeterminate expressions. A successful resolution would significantly enhance the robustness of SymPy's symbolic manipulation capabilities.
