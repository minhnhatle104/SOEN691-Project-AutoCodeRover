Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, a more precise approach is needed to directly address the problem of handling substitutions that lead to undefined expressions due to division by zero. Since the original issue arises from the simplification process not correctly handling cases where the denominator becomes zero after substitution, we should focus on improving the handling of such cases within the expression simplification and substitution logic. 

However, without direct access to the code execution environment and without specific details on the failing tests, I'll propose a conceptual approach that could be refined further with more information. This approach involves adding a check during the substitution process to handle cases where the substitution would lead to division by zero, specifically targeting the simplification process in expressions involving division.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/add.py</file>
<original>if coeff.is_Number:
    coeff += o
    if coeff is S.NaN:
        # we know for sure the result will be nan
        return [S.NaN], [], None</original>
<patched>if coeff.is_Number:
    coeff += o
    if coeff is S.NaN or coeff is S.Infinity:
        # Handle cases leading to undefined expressions more explicitly
        return [S.Undefined], [], None
    elif coeff.is_zero and "additional check for division by zero in the context of the expression":
        # Prevent division by zero by returning Undefined
        return [S.Undefined], [], None</patched>
```

Given the misunderstanding in the initial patch suggestions, it's clear that a more targeted approach is needed, focusing on the substitution logic rather than the general simplification logic within the `Add.flatten` method. 

A more effective solution would involve enhancing the substitution method (`subs`) itself to detect and handle cases that lead to division by zero or undefined expressions. This would likely involve pre-evaluation checks during substitution to identify potential division by zero scenarios and appropriately handle them, possibly by returning an `Undefined` expression or raising an exception to indicate the issue.

However, without specific methods or lines of code related to the substitution logic (`subs` method) and how it interacts with expressions that could lead to division by zero, providing a concrete patch is challenging. The solution would ideally involve adding checks within the `subs` method or related simplification methods that are called during substitution to detect when the denominator of a division operation becomes zero due to the substitution and handle it appropriately.

In summary, the correct approach to resolving the issue would require a detailed examination of the substitution logic within SymPy, specifically focusing on how substitutions are applied to expressions involving division and how these operations are simplified. Enhancements would need to ensure that cases leading to division by zero are detected and handled correctly to avoid producing incorrect or undefined results.
