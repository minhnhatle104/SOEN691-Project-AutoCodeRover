Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, it's crucial to revisit the approach while considering the nuances of SQL syntax and the potential impact of simply removing newlines and extra spaces. The goal remains to ensure that the entire `RawSQL` expression is considered for duplicate detection without altering the SQL's semantics or introducing side effects. A more nuanced approach might involve enhancing the duplicate detection logic to consider the entire SQL expression more reliably without merely flattening it into a single line.

without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_normalized).group(1)
params_hash = make_hashable(params)
# Use a more comprehensive key for the 'seen' set to include both the normalized SQL and parameters
if (without_ordering, params_hash) not in seen:
    seen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))
else:
    continue</patched>
```

This revised patch attempts to address the issue by refining the approach to normalizing the SQL expression. Instead of simply converting the SQL to a single line, it now carefully removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line before joining them. This method aims to preserve the SQL syntax and semantics more reliably while still ensuring that the entire expression is considered for duplicate detection. The key used for the `seen` set now includes both the normalized SQL and the parameters, providing a more robust basis for identifying duplicates.

This approach should mitigate the risk of altering the SQL's semantics through normalization, which might have been a factor in the test failures observed with the initial patch. However, thorough testing is still essential to confirm that this solution resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
