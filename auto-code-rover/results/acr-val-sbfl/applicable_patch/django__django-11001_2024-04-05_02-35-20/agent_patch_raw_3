Given the complexity of the issue and the challenges with previous patches, it's clear that a different approach is neededâ€”one that addresses the core problem without introducing side effects or failing tests. The issue at hand is the incorrect identification of duplicates in the `ORDER BY` clause due to reliance on a partial match of the SQL expression. A more precise solution would involve improving the way duplicates are detected without altering the SQL expression itself.

Considering the constraints and the need for a solution that maintains the integrity and semantics of the SQL expressions, a revised approach could involve using a more sophisticated method for identifying duplicates that accounts for the entirety of the SQL expression and its parameters.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</file>
<original>if (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:
    continue
seen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))</original>
<patched># Implement a more sophisticated duplicate detection mechanism
# This involves creating a hash of the entire SQL expression and its parameters
# to ensure uniqueness without altering the expression itself.
expr_hash = hash((sql, make_hashable(params)))
if expr_hash in seen:
    continue
seen.add(expr_hash)</patched>
```

This modification changes the strategy for detecting duplicates by hashing the entire SQL expression along with its parameters. This approach aims to uniquely identify each `ORDER BY` expression based on its full content rather than a potentially ambiguous part of it. By using a hash of the entire SQL expression and its parameters, we can more reliably detect duplicates without the risk of incorrectly identifying two different expressions as the same due to similarities in a portion of their SQL.

This solution should address the core issue of duplicate detection in the `ORDER BY` clause without the need to alter the SQL expression itself, thus avoiding the problems encountered with previous patches. It's essential to thoroughly test this new approach to ensure it effectively resolves the issue without introducing new problems or failing existing tests.
