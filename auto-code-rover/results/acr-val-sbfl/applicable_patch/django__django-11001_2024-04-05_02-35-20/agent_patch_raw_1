This modification addresses the issue by transforming the SQL query into a single line before performing the duplicate detection check. This ensures that the entire `RawSQL` expression is considered, rather than just the last line, thus preventing incorrect identification of duplicates based on partial matches. The `strip()` method is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace, which could affect the comparison if not handled. This change should be thoroughly tested to ensure it does not introduce any side effects, especially in complex queries or those involving special characters that might be affected by whitespace normalization.
