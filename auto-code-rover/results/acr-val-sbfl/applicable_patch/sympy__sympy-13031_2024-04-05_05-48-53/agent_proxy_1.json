            "content": "- do we need more context:\n\nGiven the analysis and the information at hand, it seems necessary to investigate the implementation details of `row_join` and `col_join` methods, as these are crucial for the functioning of `hstack` and `vstack`. Since these methods are directly responsible for the horizontal and vertical concatenation of matrices, any changes in their behavior could explain the issue observed between SymPy 1.0 and 1.1. Therefore, the following search API calls are needed to get more context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"row_join\")`: To understand how matrices are joined horizontally and to see if there were any changes in its implementation.\n2. `search_method(\"col_join\")`: To understand how matrices are joined vertically and to see if there were any changes in its implementation.\n\n- where are bug locations:\n\nBased on the current context, the bug locations are not definitively identified yet. However, the issue is likely related to the following:\n\n- **Buggy files and methods**:\n  - **File**: `sympy/matrices/common.py`\n  - **Methods**:\n    - `hstack` in the `MatrixShaping` class: Since the issue is directly related to the change in behavior of the `hstack` method.\n    - Potentially, the implementations of `row_join` and `col_join` methods, depending on where they are defined (the exact file and class are not identified without further context).\n\nFurther investigation into the `row_join` and `col_join` methods is needed to accurately pinpoint the bug locations."
