Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the problem, let's consider a different approach. The core issue seems to stem from the mismatch in the number of elements between the original input's index and the transformed data's size. This discrepancy occurs because the aggregation operation changes the number of rows, but the index assignment does not account for this change. A more robust solution would involve ensuring that the index used in `_wrap_in_pandas_container` is always compatible with the transformed data's size.

# Explanation
This modification addresses the index mismatch issue more directly by adding checks to ensure that the index is only applied if its length matches the number of rows in the data to be wrapped. If the lengths do not match, a warning is issued to inform the user, and the index is not set, allowing pandas to generate a default index. This approach prevents the `ValueError` due to index length mismatch while providing feedback to the user about the discrepancy. It handles both cases where `data_to_wrap` is already a DataFrame and when it is an ndarray that needs to be converted to a DataFrame. This solution aims to maintain the integrity of the data structure and provide clear communication to the user when an automatic adjustment is made.
