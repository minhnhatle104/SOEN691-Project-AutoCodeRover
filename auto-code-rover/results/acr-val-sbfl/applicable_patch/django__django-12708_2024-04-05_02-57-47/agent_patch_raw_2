Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, it's clear that indiscriminately deleting all found constraints is not the correct approach. The original issue arises when attempting to delete an `index_together` that has the same fields as a `unique_together`, leading to the discovery of two constraints (an index and a unique constraint) instead of one. The error is thrown because the method expects exactly one constraint to match the criteria.

A more refined approach would involve distinguishing between the types of constraints (index vs. unique) based on the operation being performed. If the operation is to delete an index, the method should only consider index constraints, ignoring unique constraints even if they match the fields. This requires adjusting the logic to filter constraints not just by their names and columns, but also by their type (index vs. unique).

Let's attempt a revised patch with this consideration.

```python
<file>django/db/backends/base/schema.py</file>
<original>    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))
</original>
<patched>    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        # Adjust constraint_kwargs to include 'index': True to ensure only index constraints are considered for deletion
        constraint_kwargs['index'] = True
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        # Process each found index constraint for deletion without raising an error for multiple constraints
        for constraint_name in constraint_names:
            self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_name))
</patched>
```

This revised patch explicitly sets `constraint_kwargs['index'] = True` to ensure that `_constraint_names` only returns index constraints, aligning with the operation's intent to delete an index. This change aims to prevent the method from mistakenly considering unique constraints that match the fields, thereby avoiding the ValueError when multiple constraints are found. Additionally, it iterates over all found index constraints for deletion, which should be safe given the adjusted constraint selection criteria.
