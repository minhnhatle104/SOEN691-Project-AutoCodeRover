Given the feedback and the need to address the issue more effectively, let's refine the approach. The error occurs because the `stream` list ends up containing a `None` element, which cannot be unpacked. The initial patch attempted to prevent appending `None` to `stream`, but considering the feedback, it seems we need a more comprehensive solution.

Upon revisiting the code, it's clear that the issue arises when handling text with empty lines, particularly in the part of the code that processes TTF fonts. The `curr_stream` might not be properly initialized for empty lines or text segments, leading to the attempt to append an uninitialized or `None` `curr_stream` to `stream`.

A more robust approach would ensure that `curr_stream` is always a valid list before any operations are performed on it, including its final append to `stream`. Additionally, ensuring that `stream` only contains valid entries before proceeding to the drawing operations is crucial.

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py</file>
<original>            stream.append(curr_stream)</original>
<patched>            if curr_stream is not None and curr_stream[1]:
                stream.append(curr_stream)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py</file>
<original>        for ps_name, xs_names in stream:</original>
<patched>        for entry in stream:
            if entry is None:
                continue
            ps_name, xs_names = entry</patched>
```

The first modification ensures that `curr_stream` is only appended to `stream` if it is not `None` and if the second element of `curr_stream` (which should be a list of glyph names and positions) is not empty. This change addresses the scenario where an empty line might result in an empty `curr_stream[1]`, which would not be meaningful to append to `stream`.

The second modification adds a safeguard during the iteration over `stream` to skip any `None` entries, preventing the unpacking error. This is a fallback mechanism to ensure robustness against any unforeseen scenarios where `None` entries might still find their way into `stream`.

These modifications together aim to address the root cause of the issue and improve the resilience of the code against similar errors.
