<patched>            # append the last entry
            if curr_stream is not None:
                stream.append(curr_stream)</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that `curr_stream` is not `None` before appending it to the `stream` list in the `RendererPS.draw_text` method. This change prevents the `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object` error when the figure contains a multi-line text label with an empty line, as reported in the issue.
