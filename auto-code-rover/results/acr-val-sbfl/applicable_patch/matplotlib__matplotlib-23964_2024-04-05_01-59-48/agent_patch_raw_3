Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that the initial approach to directly modify the appending logic for `curr_stream` to `stream` and the iteration over `stream` might not fully address the underlying issue or might introduce other problems. Reflecting on the error and the structure of the code, the issue fundamentally arises from handling text with empty lines, which seems to disrupt the expected structure of `stream`.

A more focused approach could involve ensuring that the process of constructing `stream` explicitly handles cases of empty strings or lines in a way that prevents `None` values from being introduced. However, based on the feedback, a different strategy might be necessary.

Given the limitations and the need to provide a solution without further testing feedback or the ability to introduce more complex logic changes, a hypothetical patch (not tested due to the constraints) would aim to ensure the integrity of `stream` throughout its construction and use. Since direct modifications as previously suggested did not resolve the issue, let's consider a conceptual approach that could be explored further:

### Conceptual Patch:

The core idea would be to refine the handling of text segments, especially for cases that might result in empty or malformed `curr_stream` entries. This involves a more granular check during the construction of `stream` to ensure each entry is valid and complete before it's added. Additionally, enhancing the validation of `stream` before its iteration could help catch and address any anomalies.

#### Pseudocode for Enhanced Validation and Handling:

```python
# Before appending curr_stream to stream, ensure it's properly initialized and contains valid data.
if curr_stream is not None and curr_stream[1]:
    stream.append(curr_stream)
else:
    # Handle or log the case where curr_stream is not in the expected state.
    # This could involve initializing curr_stream to a valid state or skipping the append operation.

# Prior to iterating over stream, perform a comprehensive validation to ensure each entry is unpackable.
valid_stream = [entry for entry in stream if entry is not None and len(entry) == 2 and isinstance(entry[1], list)]
for ps_name, xs_names in valid_stream:
    # Proceed with existing drawing logic.
```

#### Explanation:

- **Enhanced Validation Before Appending**: This step ensures that `curr_stream` is not just non-`None`, but also contains meaningful data (`curr_stream[1]` is not empty) before it's added to `stream`. This could help prevent issues related to empty text segments or lines.
  
- **Comprehensive Stream Validation**: Before iterating over `stream`, this conceptual patch proposes filtering `stream` to include only valid entries. A valid entry must not be `None`, should be a tuple of length 2, and its second element (expected to be a list of glyph names and positions) must be a list. This step aims to ensure that the iteration and unpacking operation only encounters well-formed data.

#### Note:

This conceptual approach outlines a direction for further investigation and testing. Given the constraints, it's essential to consider this as a starting point for a solution that would require refinement and validation within the project's development and testing environment.
