Given the complexity of the issue and the initial attempt not resolving the issue as expected, it's crucial to re-evaluate the approach towards handling the `__all__` attribute within the Sphinx autodoc extension. The goal remains to ensure that an empty `__all__` list results in no members being documented, contrary to the current behavior where it's ignored.

Upon further reflection, the modification should perhaps more directly address how members are selected for documentation in the presence of an `__all__` attribute, specifically within the `get_object_members` method of the `ModuleDocumenter` class, which is responsible for determining which members of a module are documented.

                    if member.__name__ not in self.__all__:
                        member.skipped = True

                return False, list(members.values())</original>
<patched>if want_all:
            if self.__all__ is not None:
                # Explicitly defined __all__ should always be respected, even if empty
                filtered_members = [member for member in members.values() if member.__name__ in self.__all__]
                return False, filtered_members
            else:
                # for implicit module members, check __module__ to avoid
                # documenting imported objects
                return True, list(members.values())</patched>
```

This revised modification directly filters out members not listed in `__all__` when `__all__` is explicitly defined, including handling an empty `__all__` by returning an empty list of members to document. This approach ensures that the presence of an empty `__all__` list results in no members being documented, aligning with the expected behavior described in the issue.

The key change here is the introduction of a list comprehension that filters `members.values()` based on whether their names are in `__all__`, which is only applied if `__all__` is explicitly defined (not `None`). This should ensure that an empty `__all__` leads to no members being included in the documentation, addressing the issue more directly than the initial attempt.
