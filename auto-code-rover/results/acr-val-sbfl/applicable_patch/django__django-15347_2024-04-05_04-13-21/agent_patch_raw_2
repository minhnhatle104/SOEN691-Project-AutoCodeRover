Given the feedback, let's revise the approach to ensure that the serialization and deserialization of `extra_tags` correctly handle empty strings without causing test failures. The goal is to maintain the integrity of the `extra_tags` data throughout the process.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py</file>
<original>            if obj.extra_tags:
                message.append(obj.extra_tags)</original>
<patched>            # Explicitly serialize extra_tags, ensuring empty strings are preserved
            message.append(obj.extra_tags or "")</patched>
```

This modification ensures that `extra_tags` is always serialized, even if it is an empty string. The use of `or ""` ensures that `None` values are not converted into empty strings, preserving the original intent only for cases where `extra_tags` is falsy but not `None`.

Given the initial misunderstanding, it appears there was an incorrect assumption about the handling of the deserialization process and the structure of the serialized message object. The original approach to modifying the `process_messages` method in `MessageDecoder` might not have been necessary or was based on an incorrect interpretation of the message structure. Therefore, I'll focus on ensuring the serialization process correctly handles empty strings, as this seems to be the primary source of the issue.

The initial patch attempted to address both serialization and deserialization without a clear indication that deserialization was handling empty strings incorrectly. The failure of tests suggests that the deserialization process might already correctly handle empty strings if they are properly serialized, or that the proposed change introduced a mismatch in how messages are reconstructed.

Given this, the revised patch focuses solely on ensuring that `extra_tags` is correctly serialized, which should, in turn, ensure that it is correctly deserialized without further modifications needed to the `MessageDecoder` class. This approach minimizes changes to the codebase and focuses on the root cause of the issue as identified in the initial analysis.
