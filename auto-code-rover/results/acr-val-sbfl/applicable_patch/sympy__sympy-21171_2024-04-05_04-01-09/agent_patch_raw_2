Given the limitations and the context provided, it's clear that a direct patch cannot be proposed without speculating on the root cause of the issue. However, if we were to hypothesize a potential solution based on common practices for handling unexpected keyword arguments in Python, one approach could be to modify the `_print_SingularityFunction` method to ignore unexpected keyword arguments. This is not a direct solution to the underlying problem but could prevent the error from occurring if the method is indeed being called with an unexpected `exp` keyword argument somewhere within the Sympy printing process.

Here's a hypothetical patch that introduces a mechanism to ignore unexpected keyword arguments in the `_print_SingularityFunction` method. This approach is generally not recommended without a thorough understanding of why the unexpected argument is being passed in the first place, as it may mask deeper issues in the codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>
<original>def _print_SingularityFunction(self, expr):
    shift = self._print(expr.args[0] - expr.args[1])
    power = self._print(expr.args[2])
    tex = r"{\left\langle %s \right\rangle}^{%s}" % (shift, power)
    return tex</original>
<patched>def _print_SingularityFunction(self, expr, **kwargs):
    shift = self._print(expr.args[0] - expr.args[1])
    power = self._print(expr.args[2])
    tex = r"{\left\langle %s \right\rangle}^{%s}" % (shift, power)
    return tex</patched>
```

This modification adds `**kwargs` to the method signature, allowing it to accept and ignore any number of unexpected keyword arguments. This change would prevent the `TypeError` from being raised due to an unexpected `exp` keyword argument. However, it's crucial to emphasize that this is a workaround and not a solution. The proper course of action would be to investigate why the `exp` keyword argument is being passed to this method and to address the root cause of the issue.
