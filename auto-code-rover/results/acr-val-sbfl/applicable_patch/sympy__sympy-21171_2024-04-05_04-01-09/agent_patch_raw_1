Given the context and the error message, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the bug location identification. The `_print_SingularityFunction` method itself does not directly cause the error due to an unexpected keyword argument 'exp'. The method implementation does not inherently support or expect any keyword arguments, and the error message suggests an issue with how the method is called rather than with the method itself.

However, without a clear indication of where or why an unexpected keyword argument is being passed to `_print_SingularityFunction`, we cannot provide a direct patch to this method. The actual issue might lie in the mechanism that invokes this printing function, possibly in the way `LatexPrinter` or its superclass `Printer` handles printing of expressions that involve `SingularityFunction`.

Since we cannot pinpoint a specific location in the code where the error occurs based on the provided information, and without evidence of a misuse of `_print_SingularityFunction`, suggesting a patch would be speculative. A proper fix would require a deeper investigation into how printing functions are dispatched and how keyword arguments are passed around in the printing process, which is not evident from the information provided.

Therefore, without specific code snippets showing the invocation of `_print_SingularityFunction` and without further context on the handling of keyword arguments in the printing process, we cannot propose a meaningful patch. Further investigation would be needed to identify the exact cause of the error and to determine the appropriate modifications to resolve it.
