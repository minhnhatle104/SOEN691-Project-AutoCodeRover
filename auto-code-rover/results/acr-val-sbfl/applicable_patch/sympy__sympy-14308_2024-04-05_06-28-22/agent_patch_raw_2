Given the feedback, let's focus on refining the approach to address the pretty printing issue more directly, especially focusing on the baseline alignment and ensuring the pretty printing doesn't break with vectors. Since the initial patch did not resolve the issue, we'll adjust our strategy, particularly focusing on the pretty printing process itself without altering the multiplication behavior, as that might introduce unintended side effects.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>if o1[0].startswith(u" + "):
    o1[0] = o1[0][3:]
elif o1[0].startswith(" "):
    o1[0] = o1[0][1:]</original>
<patched># Ensure the first element is correctly aligned without unnecessary spaces
if o1 and o1[0].startswith(u" + "):
    o1[0] = o1[0][3:]
elif o1 and o1[0].startswith(" "):
    o1[0] = o1[0][1:]</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>if '\n' in partstr:
    tempstr = partstr
    tempstr = tempstr.replace(vectstrs[i], '')
    tempstr = tempstr.replace(u'\N{RIGHT PARENTHESIS UPPER HOOK}',
                              u'\N{RIGHT PARENTHESIS UPPER HOOK}'
                              + ' ' + vectstrs[i])
    o1[i] = tempstr</original>
<patched># Correctly handle newlines and ensure vector symbols are aligned properly
if '\n' in partstr:
    tempstr = partstr
    # Split the string by newline and align each part
    parts = tempstr.split('\n')
    aligned_parts = []
    for part in parts:
        if vectstrs[i] in part:
            # Calculate the padding for alignment
            symbol_index = part.find(vectstrs[i])
            padding = ' ' * (max(0, symbol_index - 1))
            part = padding + part.strip()
        aligned_parts.append(part)
    o1[i] = '\n'.join(aligned_parts)</patched>
```

These modifications are focused on ensuring that the pretty printing of vectors is handled more robustly, particularly by correcting the initial alignment of expressions and improving the handling of expressions that span multiple lines. The goal is to ensure that the pretty printing output is both correct and visually consistent, addressing the baseline alignment issue without altering the fundamental behavior of vector multiplication.
