Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's revise our approach. The issue revolves around the deprecation warning for using "default.html" in the context of Django formsets, specifically for management forms which typically only require hidden inputs and do not need a full template rendering process that involves "default.html". 

Considering this, a more appropriate solution might involve modifying the rendering process for management forms to bypass the use of "default.html" entirely, rather than changing the default template paths which could have broader implications and cause tests to fail.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/renderers.py</file>
<original>
    form_template_name = "django/forms/default.html"
    formset_template_name = "django/forms/formsets/default.html"
</original>
<patched>
    # Keep the original default templates as is to avoid affecting other forms/formsets
    form_template_name = "django/forms/default.html"
    formset_template_name = "django/forms/formsets/default.html"
    # Introduce a minimal template for management forms to bypass the deprecation warning
    management_form_template_name = "django/forms/formsets/management_form_minimal.html"
</patched>
```
This modification reverts any changes to the default template paths to their original state to avoid unintended side effects that could cause tests to fail. It introduces a new template specifically for management forms, aiming to use a minimal template that does not trigger deprecation warnings.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/forms/formsets.py</file>
<original>
    @cached_property
    def management_form(self):
        # Management form logic
</original>
<patched>
    @cached_property
    def management_form(self):
        # Adjust the management form to use the new minimal template for rendering
        form = self._management_form
        # Check if the formset is being rendered with the deprecated default.html and switch to the minimal template
        if hasattr(form, 'template_name') and form.template_name.endswith("default.html"):
            form.template_name = "django/forms/formsets/management_form_minimal.html"
        return form
</patched>
```
This modification adjusts the `management_form` property to check if the `template_name` is set to the deprecated "default.html". If so, it switches to using the newly introduced minimal template for management forms. This approach targets the specific scenario described in the issue without altering the rendering process for other forms or formsets.

These modifications aim to directly address the issue by ensuring that management forms bypass the deprecated "default.html" template, thus avoiding the deprecation warning, while minimizing the impact on other parts of the application and avoiding the failures observed in tests.
