Based on the issue described and the context retrieved, here's a proposed patch to address the deprecation warning related to the use of "default.html" in Django formsets, particularly focusing on the management forms. This patch assumes that the use of "default.html" is deprecated and suggests an update to avoid this deprecation warning by specifying an alternative template or handling for management forms.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/forms/renderers.py</file>
<original>
    # form_template_name = "django/forms/div.html"
    # formset_template_name = "django/forms/formsets/div.html"
    form_template_name = "django/forms/default.html"
    formset_template_name = "django/forms/formsets/default.html"
</original>
<patched>
    # Updated to use non-deprecated templates
    form_template_name = "django/forms/div.html"
    formset_template_name = "django/forms/formsets/div.html"
</patched>
```

This modification updates the default template names to avoid using "default.html", assuming "div.html" and its formset counterpart are not deprecated. This change is made in the `django/forms/renderers.py` file, where the default template names are defined.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/forms/formsets.py</file>
<original>
    template_name_div = "django/forms/formsets/div.html"
    template_name_p = "django/forms/formsets/p.html"
    template_name_table = "django/forms/formsets/table.html"
    template_name_ul = "django/forms/formsets/ul.html"
</original>
<patched>
    template_name_div = "django/forms/formsets/div.html"
    template_name_p = "django/forms/formsets/p.html"
    template_name_table = "django/forms/formsets/table.html"
    template_name_ul = "django/forms/formsets/ul.html"
    # Added a specific template for management forms to avoid deprecation warning
    management_form_template_name = "django/forms/formsets/management_form.html"
</patched>
```

In this modification, a specific template name for management forms is introduced in the `BaseFormSet` class within `django/forms/formsets.py`. This allows for a separate handling of management forms, which can be useful if the deprecation warning is specifically tied to the rendering of these forms.

# modification 3
```python
<file>django/forms/formsets.py</file>
<original>
    @cached_property
    def management_form(self):
        # Existing implementation
</original>
<patched>
    @cached_property
    def management_form(self):
        # Adjusted to use the new management form template
        form = self._management_form
        form.template_name = self.management_form_template_name
        return form
</patched>
```

This modification adjusts the `management_form` property in the `BaseFormSet` class to use the newly introduced `management_form_template_name`. This ensures that when the management form is rendered, it uses a template that is not deprecated, thus avoiding the deprecation warning.

These modifications aim to address the issue by avoiding the use of a deprecated template ("default.html") and providing a clearer separation of template handling for management forms in Django formsets.
