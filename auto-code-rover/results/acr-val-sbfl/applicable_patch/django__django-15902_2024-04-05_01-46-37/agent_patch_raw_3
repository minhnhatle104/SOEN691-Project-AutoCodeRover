Given the constraints and the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, it's clear that a different approach is needed. The core of the issue is the deprecation warning raised due to the use of "default.html" for rendering management forms in Django formsets, which are inherently simple and do not require complex templates since they typically consist only of hidden inputs.

To address this without affecting other parts of the system or relying on specific template changes, we can consider a solution that directly addresses the rendering process of the management form to ensure it does not invoke the deprecated template mechanism. This approach would involve modifying the rendering logic to either bypass the template system for management forms or ensure that a non-deprecated method is used.

Since the detailed implementation of the rendering process and the mechanism for raising deprecation warnings are not fully outlined in the provided context, the following patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate a possible direction for resolving the issue:

# Conceptual Patch:

```python
<file>django/forms/formsets.py</file>
<original>
@cached_property
def management_form(self):
    # Original management form logic
</original>
<patched>
@cached_property
def management_form(self):
    # Conceptually adjust the management form rendering to bypass deprecated template usage
    form = self._management_form
    # Instead of setting a template_name that might be deprecated, directly render the required HTML for management forms
    # This is a conceptual patch; the actual implementation would need to adhere to Django's form rendering practices
    form.render = lambda: mark_safe(u''.join([
        u'<input type="hidden" name="%s-TOTAL_FORMS" value="%s">' % (self.prefix, self.total_form_count()),
        u'<input type="hidden" name="%s-INITIAL_FORMS" value="%s">' % (self.prefix, self.initial_form_count()),
        u'<input type="hidden" name="%s-MIN_NUM_FORMS" value="%s">' % (self.prefix, self.min_num),
        u'<input type="hidden" name="%s-MAX_NUM_FORMS" value="%s">' % (self.prefix, self.max_num),
    ]))
    return form
</patched>
```

This conceptual patch modifies the `management_form` property in the `BaseFormSet` class to directly render the hidden inputs required for management forms, bypassing the use of any template (and thus avoiding the deprecated "default.html"). The `render` method is overridden with a lambda function that returns the necessary HTML as a safe string, ensuring that the management form's HTML is generated without invoking the deprecated template system.

Please note, this patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate a potential direction. The actual implementation may require adjustments to fit within Django's form rendering framework and practices, ensuring compatibility and avoiding side effects.
