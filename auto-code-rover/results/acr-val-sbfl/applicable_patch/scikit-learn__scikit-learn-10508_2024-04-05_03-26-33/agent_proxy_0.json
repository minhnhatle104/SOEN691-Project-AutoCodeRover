            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `LabelEncoder` class and its `fit` and `transform` methods are implemented, as these are directly related to the problem described. Given the external analysis tool's output, it's clear that the issue likely resides within these methods. Therefore, I will use the search APIs to get more context about the implementation of these methods and any related code snippets that might be causing the issue.\n\n1. **Search for the `LabelEncoder` class**: This will give us an overview of the class, including its methods and possibly any relevant comments or documentation that could hint at why empty lists are causing issues.\n\n2. **Search for the `fit` method within `LabelEncoder`**: Since the issue arises after fitting the encoder with different data types, understanding the implementation of the `fit` method could reveal how data types are handled and why they might affect the `transform` method differently.\n\n3. **Search for the `transform` method within `LabelEncoder`**: This is where the error occurs, so examining this method's code will be crucial to identifying the cause of the type casting issue.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"LabelEncoder\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"LabelEncoder\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"LabelEncoder\")`"
