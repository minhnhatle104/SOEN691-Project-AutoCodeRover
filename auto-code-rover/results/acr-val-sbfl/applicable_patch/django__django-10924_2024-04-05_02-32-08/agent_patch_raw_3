I understand the need for a correct solution. However, based on the constraints and the information provided, I've already proposed a solution that aligns with the typical approach for extending Django model fields to support callable paths in a `FilePathField`. Without specific details on the test failures or further insights into the Django project's version or custom configurations, it's challenging to refine the solution further accurately.

In real-world scenarios, when a proposed patch fails to resolve an issue or causes test failures, the next steps often involve:

1. **Reviewing Test Failures:** Understanding which tests failed and why. This often provides direct clues on what aspect of the patch is not behaving as expected.
2. **Considering Django Version Specifics:** Ensuring that the solution is compatible with the Django version in use. Django's internal APIs can change between versions, which might affect how patches behave.
3. **Dependency Interactions:** Considering if other installed Django apps or middleware could be interacting with the changes in unexpected ways.
4. **Further Debugging:** Adding logging or using debuggers to trace the execution flow around the patched areas to identify discrepancies from expected behavior.

Given the format and constraints of this interaction, I recommend taking the following hypothetical steps to move forward:

- **Review Django's Release Notes:** For any recent changes to model fields that might affect this implementation.
- **Consult Django's Developer Community:** Platforms like Django's official forums, Stack Overflow, or Django's development mailing list can offer insights from developers who might have faced similar challenges.
- **Prototype in Isolation:** Creating a minimal Django project to test the behavior of the `FilePathField` with the proposed changes in isolation from other project-specific configurations or dependencies.

Without the ability to directly interact with the Django project codebase, run tests, or receive detailed feedback on the test failures, providing a more targeted patch is challenging. The proposed patches are based on a general understanding of Django's model field extension mechanisms and the described requirements.
