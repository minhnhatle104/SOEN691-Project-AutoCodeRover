Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, let's refine the approach to address the pretty printing improvements for the `Product` class more accurately. The goal remains to make the product symbol less "fat", remove the unnecessary extra line at the bottom, and possibly extend the top bar for a better appearance, all while ensuring compatibility with both Unicode and ASCII modes.

# modification 1 (Revised)
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>            sign_lines.append(corner_chr + (horizontal_chr*width) + corner_chr)
            for i in range(func_height + 1):
                sign_lines.append(vertical_chr + (' '*width) + vertical_chr)</original>
<patched>            sign_lines.append(corner_chr + (horizontal_chr*(width)) + corner_chr)
            for i in range(func_height):
                sign_lines.append(vertical_chr + (' '*width) + vertical_chr)</patched>
```
This modification aims to remove the extra line at the bottom by adjusting the loop to iterate `func_height` times instead of `func_height + 1`. The width of the horizontal lines remains unchanged from the original suggestion, as the adjustment might have been too aggressive.

# modification 2 (Revised)
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>        if self._use_unicode:
            # use unicode corners
            horizontal_chr = xobj('-', 1)
            corner_chr = u'\N{BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DOWN AND HORIZONTAL}'</original>
<patched>        if self._use_unicode:
            # use unicode corners
            horizontal_chr = xobj('-', 1)
            corner_chr = xobj('\N{BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DOWN AND HORIZONTAL}', 1)</patched>
```
This modification corrects the Unicode representation for the corner character to ensure it's properly handled as a `xobj` object. The adjustment for the vertical character is removed from this patch, as it may not directly contribute to resolving the issue and could have contributed to the test failures.

# modification 3 (Revised)
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>            width = (func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 2</original>
<patched>            width = max((func_height + 2) * 3 // 4 - 1, 1)  # Adjust width calculation to make the product symbol less "fat"</patched>
```
This revised modification aims to adjust the width calculation more conservatively than the previous attempt, seeking a balance that reduces the "fatness" of the product symbol without causing layout issues that could lead to test failures. The goal is to ensure the product symbol is visually appealing in both Unicode and ASCII modes without compromising the integrity of the layout.

These revised modifications take a more cautious approach to altering the pretty printing of the `Product` class, aiming to address the issue while minimizing the risk of unintended consequences that could lead to test failures.
