Given the constraints and the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue or led to test failures, it's clear that a more careful approach is needed, especially considering the delicate balance between making the `Product` symbol less "fat" and maintaining the integrity of the pretty printing across various expressions. Let's focus on a simpler and more direct approach to address the specific concerns raised in the issue description.

# modification 1 (Simplified)
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>            for i in range(func_height + 1):
                sign_lines.append(vertical_chr + (' '*width) + vertical_chr)</original>
<patched>            for i in range(func_height):
                sign_lines.append(vertical_chr + (' '*width) + vertical_chr)</patched>
```
This modification directly addresses the concern about the extra unnecessary line at the bottom of the product symbol by adjusting the loop to iterate `func_height` times instead of `func_height + 1`. This should remove the extra line without affecting the overall layout significantly.

# modification 2 (Simplified)
```python
<file>sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py</file>
<original>            width = (func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 2</original>
<patched>            width = max((func_height + 2) * 5 // 4 - 1, 1)</patched>
```
This simplified modification aims to slightly reduce the width of the product symbol, addressing the concern that the symbol is too "fat". The adjustment is more conservative than previous attempts, aiming to strike a balance that improves the appearance without introducing layout issues.

Given the complexity of pretty printing and the variety of expressions that the pretty printer must handle, these simplified modifications focus on the most direct feedback from the issue: removing the extra line and slightly reducing the width of the product symbol. This approach minimizes the risk of unintended consequences in the pretty printing of other expressions.
