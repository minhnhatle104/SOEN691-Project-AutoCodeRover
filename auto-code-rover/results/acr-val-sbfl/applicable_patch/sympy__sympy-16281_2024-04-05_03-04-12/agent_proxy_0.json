            "content": "To address the issue with the pretty printing of the `Product` class, I will need to gather more information about how the pretty printing is implemented in the project. Given the details in the issue, I will focus on finding the relevant class and methods that handle pretty printing. Specifically, I will look for the `Product` class and any methods related to pretty printing, such as a method that might be named `pprint` or similar. Additionally, since the issue mentions the appearance of the output with and without Unicode, it would be useful to find any methods or code snippets that handle these cases.\n\nHere are the API calls I will make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Product\")`: This will help me find the `Product` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods it might contain for pretty printing.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"pprint\", \"Product\")`: This will help me find any pretty print method specifically within the `Product` class, if it exists.\n\n3. `search_code(\"use_unicode\")`: Since the issue mentions the appearance changes with the `use_unicode` flag, searching for this code snippet will help me find where in the codebase this flag is checked and how it affects the output.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding how pretty printing is currently implemented for the `Product` class and how it might be improved."
