Since the initial search for `format_cursor_data` in the specified file path was unsuccessful, I'll adjust the approach to locate this method within the broader codebase, which could provide insights into how it's implemented and how it should handle instances of `BoundaryNorm`.\n\nTo refine the bug location and gather more context, I propose the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"format_cursor_data\")`: This will help locate the `format_cursor_data` method within the entire codebase, providing a broader search scope than the initial, file-specific search.\n\nThese searches aim to identify the precise interaction causing the crash and to explore potential modifications or error handling that could resolve the issue."
