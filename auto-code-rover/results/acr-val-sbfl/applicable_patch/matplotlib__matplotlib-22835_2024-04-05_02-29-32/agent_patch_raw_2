Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's consider an alternative approach. Since the root cause of the issue is the attempt to use the `inverse` method on `BoundaryNorm`, which is not designed to be invertible, we need to handle this specific case differently. Instead of attempting to calculate the inverse and catching a `ValueError`, we could check if the norm is a `BoundaryNorm` and, if so, bypass the inverse calculation altogether or provide a meaningful default behavior.

This modification introduces a more nuanced approach to handling the scenario where the norm is not invertible. It first checks if the `norm` object has an `inverse` method, aiming to preemptively catch cases where calling `inverse` would lead to a `ValueError`. If the norm does not support inversion, it enters the `except` block, where a fallback strategy is employed. This strategy uses a default precision for formatting the data string but also attempts to provide a more meaningful default for norms that have a 'scaled' attribute, suggesting an effort to approximate the behavior for invertible norms. This approach aims to maintain the user interaction without crashing, providing a more robust handling of non-invertible norms.
