The identified location is as follows:\n\n- **Buggy File**: `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`\n- **Buggy Method**: `Artist.format_cursor_data`\n\nThis method attempts to use the `inverse` method of a normalization instance (`self.norm`), which, when `BoundaryNorm` is used, leads to a crash due to `BoundaryNorm` being intentionally not invertible. The analysis provided outlines the nature of the bug and suggests potential approaches for resolution.\n\nGiven the information at hand, this location and method are identified as the source of the reported issue. Further clarification or correction regarding the identification of the bug location may require additional context or details not currently available or may depend on insights from the Matplotlib development team or additional diagnostic tools."
