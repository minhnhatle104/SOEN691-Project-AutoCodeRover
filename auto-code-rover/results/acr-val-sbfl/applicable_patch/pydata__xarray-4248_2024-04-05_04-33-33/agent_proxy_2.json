            "content": "Given the constraints and the need for further context to implement the feature request accurately, it appears my previous suggestion for a search API call was not correctly formatted according to the available options. Since we are particularly interested in how the dataset's representation is constructed, and assuming that this logic is encapsulated within a method that generates the string representation of the dataset, a more appropriate search might involve looking for methods related to formatting or representing the dataset in `xarray/core/dataset.py`. However, without the ability to directly invoke such a specific search API call here, I recommend manually investigating the `Dataset` class's representation methods in the `xarray/core/dataset.py` file, specifically looking for `__repr__` or any method that constructs the string representation of datasets. This manual investigation would aim to identify where and how to integrate the display of units into the dataset overview."
