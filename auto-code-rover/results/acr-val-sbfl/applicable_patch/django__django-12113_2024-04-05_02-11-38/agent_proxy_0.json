Search for the `DatabaseCreation` class to understand its responsibilities and how it might be involved in handling SQLite databases during tests:\n   - `search_class(\"DatabaseCreation\")`\n\n2. Search for the `is_in_memory_db` method within the `DatabaseCreation` class to see how it determines if a database is in-memory, which could affect locking behavior:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"is_in_memory_db\", \"DatabaseCreation\")`\n\n3. Search for the `_get_test_db_name` method within the `DatabaseCreation` class to understand how test database names are determined and if this could be related to the locking issue:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_get_test_db_name\", \"DatabaseCreation\")`\n\n4. Since the issue mentions a failure during `setUpClass` which involves database operations, it would be useful to see how the `DefaultConnectionProxy` class is implemented, particularly its `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` methods which could be involved in database connection handling:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__getattr__\", \"DefaultConnectionProxy\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__setattr__\", \"DefaultConnectionProxy\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the potential causes of the \"database is locked\" error when using persistent SQLite databases for tests."
