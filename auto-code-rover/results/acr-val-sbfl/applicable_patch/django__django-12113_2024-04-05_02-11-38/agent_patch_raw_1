Given the context and the analysis, the primary issue seems to stem from how persistent SQLite databases are handled during tests, especially when using the `--keepdb` option. The locking issue suggests that there might be a problem with either the database connection not being properly closed or concurrent access not being correctly managed. However, without specific details on the exact cause of the lock (e.g., whether it's due to concurrent access or lingering connections), the patch will focus on ensuring that persistent SQLite databases are correctly handled to minimize locking issues.

Since the detailed analysis pointed towards the `_get_test_db_name` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py` as a critical area, but the provided code snippets and analysis do not directly indicate a flaw in this method or in the `DefaultConnectionProxy` methods, the patch will instead suggest an enhancement to ensure that connections to persistent SQLite databases are properly managed during testing.

        test_database_name = self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['NAME'] or ':memory:'
        if test_database_name == ':memory:':
            return 'file:memorydb_%s?mode=memory&cache=shared' % self.connection.alias
        else:
            # Ensure the database file is closed properly after each test to prevent locking issues
            if self.connection.is_open():
                self.connection.close()
        return test_database_name
</patched>
```

This modification attempts to ensure that if a persistent database is being used (`test_database_name` is not `':memory:'`), the connection to the database is checked and closed before returning the database name for the test. This is a simplistic approach and might need further refinement based on the exact lifecycle of database connections in Django's test suite, especially with `--keepdb` and parallel testing.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on the analysis provided. The actual implementation might require a more nuanced approach, especially considering Django's complex handling of database connections and transactions during testing. Further testing and validation would be necessary to ensure this patch does not introduce other issues, especially in terms of test performance and database connection management.
