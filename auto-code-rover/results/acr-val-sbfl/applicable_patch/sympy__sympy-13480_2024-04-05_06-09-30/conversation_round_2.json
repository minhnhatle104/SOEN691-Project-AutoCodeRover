        "content": "Based on the issue description and the analysis of the suspicious methods provided by the external tool, the error occurs when substituting certain integral values into the expression involving `coth(log(tan(x)))`. The error message indicates an issue with a variable `cotm` not being defined within the `eval` method of the `coth` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet of the `coth` class's `eval` method, we can observe a few key points:\n\n1. The `eval` method attempts to simplify the `coth` function under various conditions, including handling specific numeric values, infinity, and complex infinity.\n\n2. The error likely originates from the block handling the case when `arg` is an addition (`arg.is_Add`). In this block, there's a reference to `cotm` in the condition `if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:`. However, `cotm` is not defined anywhere in the provided code snippet. Instead, the variable `cothm` is defined and used in the line just above.\n\n3. The error message and the code snippet suggest that the issue is a simple typo: `cotm` should be `cothm`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the patch should involve correcting the typo in the `eval` method of the `coth` class. Specifically, the reference to `cotm` should be changed to `cothm` to match the variable that is actually defined and used in the calculation.\n\nThis typo correction should resolve the error encountered when substituting certain integral values into the expression involving `coth(log(tan(x)))`."
