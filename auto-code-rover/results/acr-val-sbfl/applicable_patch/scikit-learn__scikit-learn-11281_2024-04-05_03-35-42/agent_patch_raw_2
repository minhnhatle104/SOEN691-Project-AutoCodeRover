Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, it's important to reconsider the approach while ensuring backward compatibility and not introducing breaking changes. The initial attempt to rename `n_components` to `n_clusters` directly in the constructor might have caused issues with existing code that relies on `n_components`. Additionally, adding `labels_` directly in the `predict` method without considering all use cases might not be the best approach. Let's adjust the strategy while keeping the original API intact as much as possible.

        return self.predict(X)</patched>
```

In this revised approach, the focus is on maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring that no existing functionality is broken. The `n_components` parameter is kept unchanged to avoid issues with existing codebases that rely on this parameter. The `predict` method remains side-effect free, and the `fit_predict` method is added for convenience without altering the class's state in an unexpected manner. This approach should minimize the risk of breaking changes while addressing the issue's core concerns.
