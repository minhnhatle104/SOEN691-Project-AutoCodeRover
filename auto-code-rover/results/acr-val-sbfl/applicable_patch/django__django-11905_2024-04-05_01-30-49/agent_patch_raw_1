This patch introduces a check within the `get_lookup` method of the `MultiColSource` class to ensure that if the `__isnull` lookup is used, it does not proceed without a proper boolean value check. However, please note that this patch is a conceptual solution based on the provided context. The actual implementation might require additional considerations, such as ensuring the value passed to `__isnull` is accessible at this point in the code and handling the check in a way that aligns with Django's design principles and error handling conventions. Further testing and validation within the Django framework would be necessary to ensure the patch's effectiveness and compatibility.
