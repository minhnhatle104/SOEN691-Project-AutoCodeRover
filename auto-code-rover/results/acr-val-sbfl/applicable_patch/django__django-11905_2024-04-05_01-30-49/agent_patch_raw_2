Given the feedback and the need to ensure that the `__isnull` lookup specifically checks for boolean values, a more refined approach is required. The initial attempt might not have addressed the core issue, which is ensuring that the value passed to `__isnull` is indeed a boolean. Let's adjust the strategy to include a way to validate the value associated with the `__isnull` lookup more directly.

Since the `get_lookup` method is used to fetch the lookup logic but does not directly handle the values passed to lookups, we need to ensure that the validation occurs at a point where the lookup value is processed. This might involve adjusting the logic where the lookup is applied rather than where it's fetched.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py</file>
<original>    def get_lookup(self, lookup):
        return self.output_field.get_lookup(lookup)
</original>
<patched>    def get_lookup(self, lookup):
        # Assuming the lookup value can be validated here is incorrect
        # as this method is about fetching the lookup logic, not processing the lookup values.
        return self.output_field.get_lookup(lookup)
</patched>
```

Given the realization that the original patch did not address the issue correctly, let's propose a new modification that targets the validation of the `__isnull` lookup value at a more appropriate location in the codebase. This requires identifying where the lookup values are actually processed or applied.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/sql/where.py</file>
<original>...</original>
<patched>from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

class WhereNode(BaseWhereNode):
    def add(self, data, connector):
        if data.lookup_name == '__isnull' and not isinstance(data.value, bool):
            raise ValidationError("__isnull lookup requires a boolean value.")
        super().add(data, connector)
</patched>
```

This modification is conceptual and assumes the existence of a `WhereNode` class or a similar structure within Django's ORM where lookup conditions are added and processed. The idea is to intercept the addition of a `__isnull` lookup condition and validate the associated value to ensure it's a boolean. This approach targets the issue more directly by validating the lookup value at the point of use.

Please note, the actual implementation details, such as the correct class and method to modify, may vary based on the specific version of Django and its internal architecture. This solution is based on a conceptual understanding of how Django's ORM might process lookup conditions and would need to be adapted to fit the actual code structure and conventions of the Django project.
