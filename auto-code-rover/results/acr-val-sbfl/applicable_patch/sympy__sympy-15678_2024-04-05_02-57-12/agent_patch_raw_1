These modifications aim to address the issues with `idiff` not supporting `Eq` and handling function symbols like `f(x)` properly. The first modification allows `idiff` to recognize function symbols as valid inputs. The second modification adjusts the substitution logic to correctly handle cases where the input is already a function of `x`. The third modification ensures that function symbols are included in the dependency set, allowing `idiff` to process them correctly.
