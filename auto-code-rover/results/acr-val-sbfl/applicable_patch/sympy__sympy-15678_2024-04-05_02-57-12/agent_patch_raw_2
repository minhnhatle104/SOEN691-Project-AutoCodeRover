Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to address the core issues more accurately. The primary goal is to ensure `idiff` correctly handles both `Eq` objects and expressions involving function symbols like `f(x)` without causing test failures. 

Upon reevaluation, it appears that the initial approach might have been too broad or misaligned with the internal workings of `idiff`. A more precise intervention is needed, focusing on correctly interpreting `Eq` objects and function expressions within the existing logic of `idiff`.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/geometry/util.py</file>
<original>if is_sequence(y):
        dep = set(y)
        y = y[0]
    elif isinstance(y, Symbol):
        dep = {y}
    else:
        raise ValueError("expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s" % y)</original>
<patched>if is_sequence(y):
        dep = set(y)
        y = y[0]
    elif isinstance(y, Symbol) or (isinstance(y, Function) and y.func != Function):
        dep = {y}
    else:
        raise ValueError("expecting x-dependent symbol(s) or a function but got: %s" % y)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sympy/geometry/util.py</file>
<original>eq = eq.subs(f)</original>
<patched>if isinstance(eq, Eq):
        eq = eq.lhs - eq.rhs
    eq = eq.subs(f)</patched>
```

These modifications aim to refine the handling of inputs to the `idiff` function:

- **Modification 1** adjusts the input validation to correctly recognize function expressions as valid dependent variables. This change ensures that `idiff` can process inputs like `f(x)` without immediately raising a `ValueError`.

- **Modification 2** adds handling for `Eq` objects by converting them into expressions that `idiff` can process. This is done by subtracting the right-hand side from the left-hand side of the equation, turning it into a form that represents `eq == 0`, which aligns with the assumption stated in the `idiff` documentation.

These changes are designed to address the specific issues reported while minimizing the impact on existing functionality and passing all relevant tests.
