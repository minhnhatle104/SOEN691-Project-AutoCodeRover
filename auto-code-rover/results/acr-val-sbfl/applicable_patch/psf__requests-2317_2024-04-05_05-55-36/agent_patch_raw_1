```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>        method = builtin_str(method)</original>
<patched>        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('utf-8')
        else:
            method = str(method)</patched>
```

This patch addresses the issue by checking if the `method` variable is an instance of bytes. If it is, it decodes the bytes to a UTF-8 string, which is the expected format for the HTTP method. If it's not a bytes instance, it converts the method to a string using the standard `str()` function, ensuring compatibility with both Python 2 and 3 without changing the behavior for non-binary string inputs. This approach avoids the problem of converting a binary string like `b'GET'` into its literal string representation `"b'GET'"`, which was causing the issue.
