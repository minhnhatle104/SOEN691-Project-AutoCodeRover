Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and led to tests timing out, it's possible that the approach needs to be refined. Considering the nature of the problem, the goal is to ensure that binary strings are correctly handled without adversely affecting the performance or functionality of the `requests` library. Let's attempt a slightly different approach that focuses on minimizing potential side effects and ensuring compatibility across different Python versions.

# modification 1
```python
<file>requests/sessions.py</file>
<original>        method = builtin_str(method)</original>
<patched>        # Check if method is a binary string and decode it to a regular string if so.
        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('ascii')
        else:
            method = str(method)</patched>
```

This revised patch still addresses the core issue of handling binary strings correctly by checking if the `method` variable is a bytes instance and decoding it accordingly. The change to decode using 'ascii' instead of 'utf-8' is made under the assumption that HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) are ASCII-based, which might help in avoiding potential issues with character encoding that could lead to the tests timing out. Additionally, this approach continues to use `str(method)` for non-binary strings to ensure that the method is always in the correct format for further processing within the `requests` library.
