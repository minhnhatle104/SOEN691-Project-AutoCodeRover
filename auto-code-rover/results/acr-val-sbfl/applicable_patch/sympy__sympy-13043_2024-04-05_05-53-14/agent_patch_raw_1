Based on the issue description, the problem lies within the `decompose()` function in the `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` file, where the function returns a list of arbitrary order when `separate=True`. The issue suggests that the return value should be sorted or structured in a way that the order is not arbitrary, to avoid test failures and ensure consistency.

Given the context, I will provide a hypothetical patch for the `decompose()` function in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`. Since the exact implementation details and the structure of the returned dictionary (`poly_dict`) are not provided, the patch will focus on sorting the list of values obtained from `poly_dict.values()` before returning it. This approach assumes that the elements of the list can be compared and sorted in a meaningful way, which is common for numerical or simple object types.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/integrals/intpoly.py</file>
<original>
return list(poly_dict.values())
</original>
<patched>
return sorted(list(poly_dict.values()))
</patched>
```

This modification applies a `sorted()` function to the list of values obtained from `poly_dict.values()`, ensuring that the returned list has a consistent order. This should resolve the issue of arbitrary order affecting test outcomes.

Please note, this patch assumes that the values within `poly_dict` are of a type that supports comparison and sorting. If the values are of a complex type that doesn't support direct comparison, or if a specific sorting criterion is needed (e.g., sorting based on a specific attribute of the objects), the sorting logic would need to be adjusted accordingly, potentially using the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function to specify how the elements should be compared.

Additionally, if the intention behind using `list(poly_dict.values())` was to return a collection without concern for order, and if maintaining the order is not critical beyond resolving the test failures, converting the return type to a `set` or directly addressing the test expectations might be alternative solutions worth considering. However, these approaches would require a deeper understanding of the intended use cases and the impact on the rest of the codebase.
