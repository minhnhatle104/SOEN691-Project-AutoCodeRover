Given that the straightforward sorting approach did not resolve the issue and led to test failures, it suggests that either the elements in `poly_dict.values()` cannot be directly sorted due to their complexity, or the order of elements is not the only factor causing the issue. Considering this, a more nuanced approach might be required to ensure consistency in the output of the `decompose()` function.

If the elements within `poly_dict.values()` are complex objects that do not support direct comparison, or if they need to be sorted based on a specific attribute or method, we can adjust the patch to sort based on a key that is consistent across all elements. Alternatively, if maintaining the exact order of insertion is important (which might be the case given that arbitrary order is causing issues), using an `OrderedDict` for `poly_dict` or ensuring the list is returned in a predictable manner might be the solution.

Let's assume the elements in `poly_dict` need to be sorted based on a specific attribute or method result, and we'll provide a patch based on this assumption. If `poly_dict` is expected to maintain insertion order and Python version used is below 3.7 where dictionaries do not guarantee order, converting `poly_dict` to an `OrderedDict` might be necessary. However, since Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order, so simply ensuring elements are added in a consistent order should suffice.

return list(poly_dict.values())

<patched>
# Assuming elements in poly_dict.values() have an attribute or method that can be used for sorting
# Example: elements have an attribute 'sort_key' or a method 'get_sort_key()' that returns a sortable value
return sorted(list(poly_dict.values()), key=lambda x: x.sort_key)
# If using a method:
# return sorted(list(poly_dict.values()), key=lambda x: x.get_sort_key())
</patched>
```

This patch assumes that the objects in `poly_dict.values()` have a sortable attribute or method. The `lambda` function in the `key` argument of `sorted()` specifies that the list should be sorted based on this attribute or method result. This approach requires knowledge of the structure of the objects in `poly_dict.values()` to apply the correct sorting criterion.

If the issue is not about the sortability of the elements but rather about maintaining the order of insertion, and if `poly_dict` does not inherently maintain this order due to the Python version or the way it's constructed, consider ensuring that `poly_dict` is either an `OrderedDict` or that its construction guarantees consistent order.

Please adjust the patch based on the actual structure of the elements in `poly_dict.values()` and the specific requirements for order consistency in the `decompose()` function's output.
