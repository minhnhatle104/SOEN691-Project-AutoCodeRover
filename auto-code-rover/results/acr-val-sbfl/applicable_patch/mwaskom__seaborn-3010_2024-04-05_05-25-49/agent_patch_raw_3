Given the constraints and the feedback received, it appears that my approach to directly address the issue with the provided information might not lead to a successful resolution without further context or the ability to iteratively test and refine the solution based on specific test failures.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the specific tests that failed to understand how the patch impacted the expected behavior.
- Considering alternative strategies for handling missing data that might be more compatible with the existing codebase and its expectations.
- Collaborating with other developers or reviewing similar issues and patches for insights.

Without the ability to perform these actions or receive more detailed feedback on the nature of the test failures, I'm unable to provide a further refined patch. 

I recommend revisiting the test failures for specific insights or consulting with the project's maintainers for guidance on how best to address this issue within the project's current structure and testing framework.
