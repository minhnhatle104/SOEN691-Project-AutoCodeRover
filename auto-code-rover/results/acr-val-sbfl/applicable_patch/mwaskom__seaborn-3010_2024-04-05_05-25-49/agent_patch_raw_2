Given the feedback, let's refine the approach to ensure that the patch not only handles missing data but also maintains compatibility with the rest of the seaborn functionality and passes all tests. A possible oversight could be in how empty arrays are handled or the return structure when there's insufficient data after filtering out missing values. Let's adjust the patch to ensure it gracefully handles these scenarios.

# modification 1
```python
<file>seaborn/_stats/regression.py</file>
<original>    def _fit_predict(self, data):

        x = data["x"]
        y = data["y"]
        if x.nunique() <= self.order:
            # TODO warn?
            xx = yy = []
        else:
            p = np.polyfit(x, y, self.order)
            xx = np.linspace(x.min(), x.max(), self.gridsize)
            yy = np.polyval(p, xx)

        return pd.DataFrame(dict(x=xx, y=yy))
</original>
<patched>    def _fit_predict(self, data):
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np

        # Ensure data for 'x' and 'y' is not None and drop rows with missing values
        valid_data = data.dropna(subset=["x", "y"])
        x = valid_data["x"]
        y = valid_data["y"]

        # Initialize xx and yy as empty arrays in case of early return
        xx = np.array([])
        yy = np.array([])

        # Proceed only if there are enough unique x values and data is not empty
        if not x.empty and x.nunique() > self.order:
            p = np.polyfit(x, y, self.order)
            xx = np.linspace(x.min(), x.max(), self.gridsize)
            yy = np.polyval(p, xx)

        # Return a DataFrame even if xx and yy are empty, to maintain consistent return type
        return pd.DataFrame(dict(x=xx, y=yy))
</patched>
```

This revised patch ensures that:
- Missing data is filtered out without affecting rows where both 'x' and 'y' are present.
- The function returns a DataFrame with empty 'x' and 'y' columns if there's insufficient data after filtering, which should help maintain compatibility with the expected return type and structure in seaborn's plotting functions.
- The check for `x.empty` ensures that we only attempt polynomial fitting if there's actual data to work with, avoiding potential errors from `np.polyfit` when called with empty arrays.
