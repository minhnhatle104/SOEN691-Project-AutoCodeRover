Based on the provided context and the issue of "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" warnings after upgrading to Sphinx 3.3, the patch should address the scenario where a table (or any figure) does not get a number assigned, yet a `numref` is attempted to be resolved. The warning is generated in the `_resolve_numref_xref` method when a figure number cannot be found. To resolve this issue, we can enhance the warning message to provide more context about the missing number assignment and suggest potential fixes or checks for the documentation author.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/domains/std.py</file>
<original>logger.warning(__("no number is assigned for %s: %s"), figtype, labelid,
                           location=node)</original>
<patched>logger.warning(__("no number is assigned for %s: %s. Ensure that the figure/table is properly labeled and that numbering is enabled for the type of figure/table."), figtype, labelid,
                           location=node)</patched>
```

This patch enhances the warning message to provide more actionable advice to the user. It suggests ensuring that the figure or table is properly labeled and that numbering is enabled for its type, which are common reasons why a number might not be assigned. This change doesn't alter the logic of how numbers are assigned or how references are resolved but aims to make the warning more helpful to users encountering this issue.

Note: The actual implementation might require adjustments or additional context based on the full Sphinx codebase and its localization practices, especially for the warning message.
