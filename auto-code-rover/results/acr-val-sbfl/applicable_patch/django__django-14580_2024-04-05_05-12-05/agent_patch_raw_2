Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and caused some tests to fail, let's revise the approach. The goal remains to ensure that the necessary import for `models` is included when custom model fields or mixins derived from `models.Model` are serialized. A more refined approach is needed to accurately include imports without affecting other parts of the system negatively.

Considering the original issue where the `models` import is missing in migrations involving custom fields or mixins, a potential oversight could be in how we determine when to add `"from django.db import models"` specifically for custom types. The original patch attempted to address this by modifying the handling of special cases and adding a check for the `"django.db.models"` module. However, this approach might be too broad or not accurately target the scenario described.

Let's attempt a more targeted patch that focuses on ensuring custom fields and mixins correctly trigger the inclusion of the necessary `models` import without introducing broader changes that could impact other serialization scenarios.

        special_cases = [
            (models.Model, "models.Model", []),
            (type(None), 'type(None)', []),
        ]
        for case, string, imports in special cases:
            if case is self.value:
                return string, set(imports)
        if hasattr(self.value, "__module__"):
            module = self.value.__module__
            if module == builtins.__name__:
                return self.value.__name__, set()
            else:
                return "%s.%s" % (module, self.value.__qualname__), {"import %s" % module}
</original>
<patched>    def serialize(self):
        special_cases = [
            (models.Model, "models.Model", ["from django.db import models"]),
            (type(None), 'type(None)', []),
        ]
        # Adjusting the handling of special cases to include necessary imports
        for case, string, imports in special_cases:
            if isinstance(self.value, case):
                import_statements = {"import %s" % imp for imp in imports}
                return string, import_statements
        # Enhanced logic to handle custom model fields or mixins extending models.Model
        if hasattr(self.value, "__module__") and issubclass(self.value, models.Model):
            return "%s.%s" % (self.value.__module__, self.value.__qualname__), {"from django.db import models"}
        elif hasattr(self.value, "__module__"):
            module = self.value.__module__
            if module == builtins.__name__:
                return self.value.__name__, set()
            else:
                return "%s.%s" % (module, self.value.__qualname__), {"import %s" % module}
</patched>
```

This revised patch includes a more careful handling of custom model fields and mixins. It introduces a check to determine if the value being serialized is a subclass of `models.Model`, which should cover custom fields and mixins. If this condition is met, the patch ensures that `"from django.db import models"` is included in the set of imports. This approach aims to be more precise in addressing the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
