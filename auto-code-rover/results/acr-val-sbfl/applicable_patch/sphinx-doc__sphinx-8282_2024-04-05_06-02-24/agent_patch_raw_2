Given the constraints and the information provided, creating a speculative patch without a clear indication of where the logic fails is challenging. However, based on the understanding that the issue revolves around the handling of `autodoc_typehints` for overloaded functions, I'll provide a hypothetical patch aimed at ensuring that overloaded functions respect the `autodoc_typehints` setting. This patch is speculative and would need to be validated and possibly adjusted in the actual codebase.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>if self.analyzer and '.'.join(self.objpath) in self.analyzer.overloads:
    # Use signatures for overloaded functions instead of the implementation function.
    overloaded = True
else:
    overloaded = False
    sig = super().format_signature(**kwargs)
    sigs.append(sig)</original>
<patched>if self.analyzer and '.'.join(self.objpath) in self.analyzer.overloads and self.env.config.autodoc_typehints != 'none':
    # Use signatures for overloaded functions instead of the implementation function, respecting the autodoc_typehints setting.
    overloaded = True
else:
    overloaded = False
    sig = super().format_signature(**kwargs)
    sigs.append(sig)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py</file>
<original>if app.config.autodoc_typehints != 'description':
    return</original>
<patched>if app.config.autodoc_typehints == 'none':
    # Skip processing typehints if autodoc_typehints is set to 'none'
    return
elif app.config.autodoc_typehints != 'description':
    # Additional logic here to handle overloaded functions when autodoc_typehints is not 'none'
    # This is a placeholder for potential logic adjustment
    pass</patched>
```

These modifications are based on the assumption that the handling of `autodoc_typehints` for overloaded functions needs to be explicitly considered in the logic of `sphinx.ext.autodoc`. The first modification ensures that the processing of overloaded functions' signatures respects the `autodoc_typehints` setting by not using the overloaded signatures if `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'none'. The second modification is a placeholder for potentially more complex logic that might be needed in `merge_typehints` to handle overloaded functions appropriately based on the `autodoc_typehints` setting.

Please note, these patches are speculative and based on the assumption of where the issue might lie. Actual implementation and testing in the Sphinx codebase would be necessary to validate and refine these changes.
