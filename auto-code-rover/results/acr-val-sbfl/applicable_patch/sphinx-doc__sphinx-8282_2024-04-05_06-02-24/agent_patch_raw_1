Given the context and the nature of the issue, it seems the primary concern is ensuring that the `autodoc_typehints` setting is respected for overloaded functions. The provided code snippets do not directly show where the handling of `autodoc_typehints` fails for overloaded functions, but they do provide insight into where adjustments might be necessary. 

Since the issue is with overloaded callables not being documented according to the `autodoc_typehints` setting, a potential patch would involve ensuring that overloaded signatures are correctly processed when `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'none'. However, without a clear bug in the provided snippets, the patch would be speculative. 

A speculative approach to address this could involve ensuring that when `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'none', the documentation generation process either skips the type hints for overloaded functions or handles them in a way that aligns with the user's settings. This might involve adjusting how overloaded signatures are collected and processed in `format_signature` methods and possibly in `merge_typehints`.

However, without a clear indication of a malfunction in the provided code snippets and without the ability to test changes, proposing a specific code patch is challenging. A general approach would involve reviewing and possibly adjusting the logic in `format_signature` methods for overloaded functions and in `merge_typehints` to respect the `autodoc_typehints` setting.

Given these constraints, I recommend further investigation into how `autodoc_typehints` interacts with the processing of overloaded functions within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension, specifically in the areas highlighted by the provided code snippets. This would likely involve debugging to pinpoint where the current logic fails to apply the setting as expected and then making targeted adjustments based on those findings.

For a concrete patch, one would need to identify the specific logic that fails to respect the `autodoc_typehints` setting for overloaded functions, which is not clearly evident from the provided snippets.
