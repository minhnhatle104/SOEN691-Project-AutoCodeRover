Given the complexity of the issue and the speculative nature of the previous patches, it's clear that a more nuanced approach is needed to address the problem effectively. The issue at hand involves ensuring that the `autodoc_typehints` setting is respected for overloaded functions, which requires a careful adjustment to how Sphinx processes these functions during documentation generation.

Given the limitations in directly identifying the malfunctioning logic from the provided snippets and the failure of the speculative patches, a more general and conceptual patch will be proposed. This patch aims to provide a direction for further investigation and adjustment in the Sphinx codebase.

# Conceptual Patch

The goal is to ensure that when `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'none', Sphinx does not include type hints for overloaded functions in the generated documentation. This requires adjustments in how overloaded functions are detected and how their signatures are processed in relation to the `autodoc_typehints` setting.

## Modification 1: Ensuring Overloaded Signatures Respect `autodoc_typehints`

```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>if overloaded:
    __globals__ = safe_getattr(self.object, '__globals__', {})
    for overload in self.analyzer.overloads.get('.'.join(self.objpath)):
        overload = evaluate_signature(overload, __globals__,
                                      self.env.config.autodoc_type_aliases)

        sig = stringify_signature(overload, **kwargs)
        sigs.append(sig)</original>
<patched>if overloaded and self.env.config.autodoc_typehints != 'none':
    __globals__ = safe_getattr(self.object, '__globals__', {})
    for overload in self.analyzer.overloads.get('.'.join(self.objpath)):
        overload = evaluate_signature(overload, __globals__,
                                      self.env.config.autodoc_type_aliases)

        # Only append the signature if autodoc_typehints is not set to 'none'
        sig = stringify_signature(overload, **kwargs)
        sigs.append(sig)
else:
    # Handle the case where autodoc_typehints is 'none'
    # Potentially skip adding signatures or handle differently</patched>
```

## Modification 2: Adjusting `merge_typehints` for Overloaded Functions

Given that the `merge_typehints` function does not directly show handling for overloaded functions, and considering the speculative nature of changes, a conceptual adjustment is proposed to ensure that type hints for overloaded functions are processed according to the `autodoc_typehints` setting.

```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py</file>
<original>if app.config.autodoc_typehints != 'description':
    return</original>
<patched># Conceptual adjustment to include logic that checks for overloaded functions
# and ensures their type hints are processed according to autodoc_typehints setting.
if app.config.autodoc_typehints == 'none':
    # Specific logic to handle or ignore type hints for overloaded functions
    # This could involve skipping the merge of type hints or adjusting how they are presented
else:
    # Existing logic for when autodoc_typehints is 'description' or other values</patched>
```

These conceptual modifications aim to provide a direction for addressing the issue with `autodoc_typehints` and overloaded functions. The exact implementation would require a deeper understanding of the Sphinx codebase and thorough testing to ensure compatibility and correctness. The proposed changes highlight the need to conditionally process overloaded functions based on the `autodoc_typehints` setting and suggest areas in the code where such logic might be implemented or adjusted.
