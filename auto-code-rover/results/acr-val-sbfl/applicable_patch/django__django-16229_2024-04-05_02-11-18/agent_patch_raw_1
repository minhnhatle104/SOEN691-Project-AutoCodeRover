Given the issue description and the analysis, the problem seems to revolve around how formsets, particularly inline formsets with `ArrayField`, handle default values and validation states upon form resubmission in the Django admin. Since the specific cause of the issue is not directly pinpointed in the provided context, the patch will focus on ensuring that default values are correctly managed and that validation errors properly prevent form dismissal upon resubmission.

Please note, without the ability to directly test and validate the patch in the context of the full Django project and the specific issue at hand, the following proposed patch is speculative and aims to address the described behavior based on the analysis.

        """
        Yield formsets and the corresponding inlines.

        for inline in self.get_inline_instances(request, obj):
            yield inline.get_formset(request, obj), inline
</original>
<patched>    def get_formsets_with_inlines(self, request, obj=None):
        """
        Yield formsets and the corresponding inlines.
        Ensure that formsets correctly handle default values and validation errors.
        """
        for inline in self.get_inline_instances(request, obj):
            formset_class = inline.get_formset(request, obj)
            formset = formset_class(request.POST or None, instance=obj)
            if request.method == 'POST':
                # Ensure default values are correctly set on form resubmission
                for form in formset.forms:
                    if not form.has_changed() and form.instance.pk is None:
                        form.instance = form._meta.model(**form.initial)
            yield formset, inline
</patched>
```

This modification aims to address the issue by ensuring that upon a POST request, if a form within the formset has not changed and is associated with a new instance (i.e., `form.instance.pk is None`), the form instance is reinitialized with the initial values. This approach attempts to ensure that default values are correctly propagated and maintained upon form resubmission, especially in scenarios where validation errors occur.

Please be aware that this patch is speculative and should be thoroughly tested in a development environment before being applied to a production environment. It's also recommended to review the Django project's contribution guidelines and consider submitting the issue and the proposed patch for review by the Django community or project maintainers, as they can provide valuable insights and feedback.
