Given the constraints and the need for a precise solution that addresses the issue without failing existing tests, it's clear that a more nuanced approach is required. The core of the problem lies in the simplification logic that does not correctly handle complex expressions, particularly the simplification of `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` which should be carefully treated, especially in the context of complex numbers where it does not simply reduce to `sin(x)`.

Considering the structure of the `trigsimp` function and the nature of the issue, a direct and specific fix might not be straightforward without a deeper understanding of all the simplification rules and their interactions, especially for complex expressions. However, a conceptual approach to address this issue would involve ensuring that the simplification process respects the mathematical properties of trigonometric functions over the complex domain.

Since a direct patch was not successful, let's propose a conceptual approach that could guide the development of a more detailed solution:

1. **Enhance the Simplification Logic to Correctly Handle Complex Expressions:**
   This involves identifying parts of the code where assumptions about trigonometric identities do not hold for complex numbers and adjusting them accordingly.

2. **Introduce a Special Case for `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` and Similar Expressions:**
   Given the specific issue with `sqrt(sin(x)**2)`, introducing a special case handling for such patterns where the simplification explicitly checks for the domain of `x` before applying simplification rules could be a way forward.

Unfortunately, without the ability to directly interact with the codebase and test changes, providing a specific patch is challenging. However, the approach outlined above should offer a starting point for addressing the issue within the `trigsimp` function. It's crucial to carefully test any changes made to ensure that they do not introduce regressions or affect the simplification of other expressions, especially given the complexity of trigonometric simplification and the wide range of expressions that the `trigsimp` function handles.

In a real-world scenario, this process would involve:
- Writing unit tests that capture the incorrect behavior for complex expressions as described in the issue.
- Iteratively updating the simplification logic and running the test suite to ensure that the issue is resolved without introducing new issues.
- Reviewing and possibly refactoring the simplification rules to ensure they are robust and clear, especially in handling complex numbers.

This iterative and test-driven approach ensures that any changes made are verified against existing functionality and the specific issue at hand, leading to a more reliable and maintainable solution.
