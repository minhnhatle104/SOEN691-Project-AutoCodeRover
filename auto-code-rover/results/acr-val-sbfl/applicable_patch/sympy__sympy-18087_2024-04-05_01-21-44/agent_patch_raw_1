Given the nature of the issue, which involves incorrect simplification of trigonometric expressions involving complex numbers, the patch should ensure that the simplification process respects the mathematical properties of trigonometric functions over the complex domain. Specifically, the simplification of `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` should not automatically simplify to `cos(x) + sin(x)` without considering the domain of `x`.

However, without specific details on the incorrect behavior within the `trigsimp` function's logic or a clear indication of where the bug originates from the provided code snippet, proposing an exact patch is challenging. A general approach to address this issue would involve adding a check to ensure that the simplification process accounts for the domain of the input expression, especially when dealing with square roots and trigonometric functions.

Below is a conceptual patch that introduces a hypothetical check to handle expressions involving `sqrt` and trigonometric functions more cautiously. This is a high-level suggestion and might require adaptation to fit into the actual SymPy codebase structure and conventions.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py</file>
<original>return trigsimpfunc(expr)</original>
<patched># Before applying the final simplification, check if the expression involves complex numbers
# and adjust the simplification logic accordingly. This is a conceptual patch.
if expr.has(sqrt) and any(expr.has(func) for func in (sin, cos)):
    # Hypothetical function to handle complex domain considerations
    expr = handle_complex_trig_simplification(expr)
return trigsimpfunc(expr)</patched>
```

Please note, the `handle_complex_trig_simplification` function is hypothetical and represents a function that would need to be implemented to specifically address the issue of simplifying trigonometric expressions involving complex numbers correctly. This function would include logic to correctly handle expressions like `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` based on the domain of `x`.

This patch is conceptual and aims to highlight the direction for a fix rather than provide a ready-to-use solution, given the complexity of the issue and the need for a deep understanding of the `trigsimp` function's internals and the mathematical properties involved.
