Given this, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. `search_method(\"trigsimp\")`: This will help us find where the `trigsimp` method is defined in the codebase, which is crucial for understanding how it currently simplifies trigonometric expressions and identifying where the bug might be.\n\n2. `search_code(\"cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2)\")`: By searching for the specific expression mentioned in the issue, we might find test cases or examples in the codebase that are related to this bug. This could provide insights into how the expression is handled or should be handled by `trigsimp`.\n\nThese API calls should give us a good starting point for diagnosing and fixing the issue."
