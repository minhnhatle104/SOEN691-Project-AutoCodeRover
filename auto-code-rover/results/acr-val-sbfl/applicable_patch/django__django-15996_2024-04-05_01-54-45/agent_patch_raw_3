Given the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach to decomposing and serializing combined Enum flags. Since the direct approach and the refined attempt did not resolve the issue, let's consider a different strategy that might align better with Django's serialization framework and the nature of Enum flags.

This time, I'll focus on a more generic approach that doesn't rely on checking specific Enum or Flag types but rather works based on the value itself, which should be more flexible and potentially avoid issues identified in the tests.

<file>django/db/migrations/serializer.py</file>
<original>    def serialize(self):
        enum_class = self.value.__class__
        module = enum_class.__module__
        return (
            "%s.%s[%r]" % (module, enum_class.__qualname__, self.value.name),
            {"import %s" % module},
        )
</original>
<patched>    def serialize(self):
        enum_class = self.value.__class__
        module = enum_class.__module__
        # Attempt to directly use the name attribute for single Enum values
        try:
            enum_name = self.value.name
            return (
                "%s.%s.%s" % (module, enum_class.__qualname__, enum_name),
                {"import %s" % module},
            )
        except AttributeError:
            # For combined Enum flags, which do not have a direct .name attribute
            # Serialize by reconstructing the combined value from its individual flags
            flags = [flag for flag in enum_class if flag.value & self.value == flag.value]
            combined_expression = " | ".join(["%s.%s.%s" % (module, enum_class.__qualname__, flag.name) for flag in flags])
            return (
                combined_expression,
                {"import %s" % module},
            )
</patched>
```

This modification takes a different approach by first trying to access the `.name` attribute of the Enum value, which would work for single Enum values. If this fails (due to an `AttributeError` which would occur for combined Enum flags without a direct `.name` attribute), it falls back to a method that iterates through the Enum class's members to find those flags that contribute to the combined value. This is done by checking if the bitwise AND (`&`) of the flag's value and the combined value equals the flag's value, indicating the flag is part of the combination. The serialization then constructs the combined expression by joining these individual flags with the bitwise OR operator (`|`).

This approach aims to be more robust by handling both single and combined Enum flags appropriately, ensuring compatibility with Django's serialization framework while addressing the issue outlined.
