Given the feedback, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the application of the patch or an oversight in its formulation. Let's revise the approach to ensure the issue is correctly addressed. The goal is to prevent the `is_upper` method from attempting to access indices that are out of bounds for matrices where the number of rows exceeds the number of columns. Here's a revised patch that takes a closer look at the logic and aims to correct the issue more accurately.

```

This revised patch correctly limits the range of the inner loop to the minimum of the current row index `i` and the total number of columns `self.cols`, ensuring that the method does not attempt to access columns outside the matrix's bounds. This should address the issue of `IndexError` for matrices with more rows than columns while maintaining the intended functionality of checking if the matrix is upper triangular.
