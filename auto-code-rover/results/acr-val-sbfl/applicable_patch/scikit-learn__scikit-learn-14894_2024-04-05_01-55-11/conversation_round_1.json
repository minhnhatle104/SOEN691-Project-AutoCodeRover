This error is triggered during the construction of the `dual_coef_` sparse matrix.\n\nThe relevant portion of the code is as follows:\n\n```python\nif hasattr(self, \"classes_\"):\n    n_class = len(self.classes_) - 1\nelse:  # regression\n    n_class = 1\nn_SV = self.support_vectors_.shape[0]\n\ndual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)\ndual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,\n                             dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)\nself.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(\n    (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),\n    (n_class, n_SV))\n```\n\nThe error occurs because `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class` results in a division by zero when `n_class` is 1 (in the case of regression) and `n_SV` (the number of support vectors) is 0. This situation arises when there are no support vectors, which can happen with certain datasets and SVM configurations.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that division by zero is avoided by checking if `n_SV` is zero and handling this case appropriately. If `n_SV` is zero, we should set `self.dual_coef_` to an empty sparse matrix, as expected in the issue description.\n\nA patch needs to be developed to address this specific scenario in the `_sparse_fit` method. Let's proceed to draft a solution for this problem."
