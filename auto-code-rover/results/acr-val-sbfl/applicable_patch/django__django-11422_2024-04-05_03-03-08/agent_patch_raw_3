Given the constraints and the feedback that the previous patches did not resolve the issue, it's clear that a direct modification to ensure `manage.py` is included in the watched files or enhancing logging for troubleshooting did not address the root cause of the problem. Without specific details on the failure of the tests and without being able to directly identify why `manage.py` changes are not triggering the autoreloader in Django 2.2.1, providing a precise patch is challenging.

However, considering the nature of the issue, a potential oversight could be in how the autoreloader is set up initially. If `manage.py` is not being tracked, it might be due to its absence in the initial set of files that the autoreloader is configured to monitor. Since direct modifications to include `manage.py` explicitly or to enhance logging did not solve the issue, and without further specific diagnostic information or error messages, we're left to speculate on a solution that could potentially address a broader range of scenarios where files might not be detected by the autoreloader.

Given this, I must clarify that without the ability to directly interact with the codebase, run tests, or see the specific errors from the failed tests, any proposed solution from this point is highly speculative and should be considered as a conceptual approach to troubleshooting and potentially resolving the issue.

# Conceptual Approach for Further Investigation

1. **Review Initial Setup of Autoreloader**: It's crucial to ensure that the autoreloader's initial setup correctly includes all relevant files, including `manage.py`. This might involve reviewing how the list of files to be monitored is generated and ensuring it's comprehensive.

2. **Ensure Comprehensive File Monitoring**: Beyond just including `manage.py`, ensure that the mechanism for detecting changes is robust and accounts for all types of file changes, including creations, modifications, and deletions.

3. **Test with Different Environments**: Since the issue was reported on OSX 10.11, testing the autoreloader's behavior on different operating systems and environments could help identify if the issue is environment-specific.

4. **Review Changes Between Django Versions**: Given that the issue was introduced in Django 2.2.1, reviewing the changes made to the autoreload mechanism between versions 2.1.8 and 2.2.1 could provide insights into what might have caused the regression.

5. **Engage with Django Community**: If the issue persists, engaging with the Django community, including reporting the issue on Django's issue tracker (if not already done) and seeking insights from Django developers, could provide additional perspectives and potential solutions.

Without the ability to directly propose a code patch that resolves the issue based on the provided information and the constraints of this interaction, these conceptual steps are recommended for further investigation and troubleshooting of the issue with the autoreloader not tracking changes in `manage.py`.
