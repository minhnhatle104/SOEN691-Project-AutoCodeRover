Given the context and the nature of the issue, the most straightforward "patch" in this scenario would be more of a documentation or usage guidance update rather than a code change. The underlying issue is not a bug in the code but a change in the naming convention for seaborn styles within matplotlib, which requires users to update their code accordingly. However, for the sake of exercise, let's assume we want to introduce a backward compatibility feature that allows users to use the old seaborn style names without encountering a `KeyError`.

```

This modification introduces backward compatibility by automatically mapping the old seaborn style names to their new names prefixed with "seaborn-v0_8-". Additionally, it issues a warning to the user about this automatic mapping, encouraging them to update their style names for future compatibility. This approach allows existing code to run without modification while clearly communicating the need for updates to align with the new naming convention.
