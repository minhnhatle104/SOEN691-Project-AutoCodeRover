The external analysis tool has highlighted a few suspicious methods that could be contributing to this issue. Let's focus on the methods within `GoogleDocstring` that are most likely to affect the rendering of attribute names:\n\n1. `_parse_attributes_section` - This method seems directly related to how attributes are parsed and could be where the overescaping occurs.\n2. `_escape_args_and_kwargs` - Given its name, this method might be responsible for unnecessary escaping, including the trailing underscore issue.\n\nWe will start by examining these methods to understand their implementation and identify where the bug might be.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(method_name=\"_parse_attributes_section\", class_name=\"GoogleDocstring\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(method_name=\"_escape_args_and_kwargs\", class_name=\"GoogleDocstring\")`"
