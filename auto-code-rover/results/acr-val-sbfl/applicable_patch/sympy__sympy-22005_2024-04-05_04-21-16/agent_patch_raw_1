Based on the issue description and the context retrieved, the issue arises from the handling of polynomial systems that potentially have an infinite number of solutions. The provided patch in the issue description suggests a condition to ensure that the system only attempts to solve univariate systems (systems with one equation and one generator) directly. This is to prevent incorrect handling of systems that should report an infinite number of solutions but don't.

Given the context from the `solve_generic` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, the modification needs to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles cases where the system is not zero-dimensional, thus potentially having an infinite number of solutions.

Here is the proposed patch based on the analysis:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/solvers/polysys.py</file>
<original>
if len(univariate) == 1:
    f = univariate.pop()
else:
    raise NotImplementedError(filldedent('''
        only zero-dimensional systems supported
        (finite number of solutions)
        '''))
</original>
<patched>
if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == len(system):
    f = univariate.pop()
else:
    raise NotImplementedError(filldedent('''
        only zero-dimensional systems supported
        (finite number of solutions)
        '''))
</patched>
```

This modification ensures that the check for whether to solve the system directly or raise a `NotImplementedError` takes into account both the number of univariate equations and the total number of generators in the system. This aligns with the issue's description, where the problem was that the system incorrectly handled cases by not considering the total number of generators versus the number of equations, leading to incorrect assumptions about the system's dimensionality.

Please note, this patch is based on the understanding derived from the issue description and the provided context. Further testing and validation in the actual codebase are necessary to ensure that this patch correctly addresses the issue without introducing new problems.
