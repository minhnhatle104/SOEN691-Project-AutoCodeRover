Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, it's clear that a different approach or a more nuanced fix is required. Considering the original issue revolves around the handling of systems that potentially have an infinite number of solutions, and the initial patch aimed to refine the conditions under which the system decides it can solve a set of equations directly, let's re-evaluate and propose a revised patch.

The core of the issue seems to be in the determination of when a system is considered solvable by the `solve_generic` function, specifically in relation to the dimensionality of the system. The initial attempt focused on adjusting the condition within the `_solve_reduced_system` method but might have missed addressing the fundamental logic flaw or did not cover all edge cases.

Upon further reflection, a more accurate approach would involve ensuring that the system's dimensionality is correctly assessed before attempting to solve it, particularly ensuring that the system does not attempt to solve systems with more variables than equations, which could imply an infinite number of solutions.

Here is a revised patch based on this understanding:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/solvers/polysys.py</file>
<original>
if len(univariate) == 1:
    f = univariate.pop()
else:
    raise NotImplementedError(filldedent('''
        only zero-dimensional systems supported
        (finite number of solutions)
        '''))
</original>
<patched>
if len(univariate) == 1 and len(system) >= len(gens):
    f = univariate.pop()
else:
    raise NotImplementedError(filldedent('''
        only zero-dimensional systems supported
        (finite number of solutions). Ensure the number of equations is not less than the number of variables.
        '''))
</patched>
```

This modification adjusts the condition to not only check if there is one univariate equation but also ensures that the number of equations in the system is not less than the number of variables (generators). This change aims to address the issue by preventing the solver from attempting to solve systems where the number of variables exceeds the number of equations, which could lead to an infinite number of solutions, thus requiring a `NotImplementedError` to be raised with a more descriptive message.

This patch is crafted with the intention of addressing the described issue more accurately. However, it's crucial to conduct thorough testing with various cases, including those with equal numbers of equations and variables, more equations than variables, and more variables than equations, to ensure the patch effectively resolves the issue without introducing unintended side effects.
