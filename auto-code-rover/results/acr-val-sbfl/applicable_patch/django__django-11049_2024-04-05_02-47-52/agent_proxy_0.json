Given the external analysis tool's output, we should focus on the `DurationField` class and related methods that might be responsible for validating the input and generating the error message. Additionally, understanding how durations are parsed could provide insight into how the error message should be formatted.\n\nLet's start by examining the `DurationField` class and the `parse_duration` function, as these are directly related to the issue described:\n\n1. **Examine the `DurationField` class**: This will help us understand how durations are handled and where the error message might be generated or defined.\n   - `search_class(\"DurationField\")`\n\n2. **Examine the `parse_duration` function**: Since this function is likely responsible for parsing the string input into a duration, it might contain logic that enforces or expects a specific format, which could be related to the error message.\n   - `search_method(\"parse_duration\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue and identifying where changes might need to be made."
