Based on the context retrieved and the analysis of the issue with the `Subquery.as_sql` method generating invalid SQL by removing the first and last characters of the `subquery_sql` string, here is a proposed patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>        template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql[1:-1]</original>
<patched>        # Ensure that subquery_sql is only modified if it starts and ends with parentheses
        if subquery_sql.startswith('(') and subquery_sql.endswith(')'):
            template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql[1:-1]
        else:
            template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql</patched>
```

This patch modifies the `Subquery.as_sql` method to ensure that the `subquery_sql` string is only stripped of its first and last characters if it indeed starts and ends with parentheses. This approach aims to prevent the generation of invalid SQL by preserving the integrity of the `subquery_sql` string when it does not conform to the expected format. This change addresses the issue described, ensuring that the output SQL is valid regardless of the initial state of the `subquery_sql` string.
