My responses are based on the information provided and the capabilities available to me up to this point. \n\nGiven the constraints, I've provided the most accurate analysis possible with the information at hand. The identified location for the issue, based on the initial description and subsequent search results, is within the `Subquery.as_sql` method in the `django/db/models/expressions.py` file. This method's handling of the SQL string, particularly the removal of the first and last characters, has been pinpointed as the source of the problem.\n\nFor further action or more precise identification of the issue, direct access to the codebase, additional context about the project's structure, or the ability to perform more targeted searches would be required. In the absence of these capabilities, I recommend a manual review of the `Subquery.as_sql` method and related components within the Django framework, guided by the insights provided in the analysis."
