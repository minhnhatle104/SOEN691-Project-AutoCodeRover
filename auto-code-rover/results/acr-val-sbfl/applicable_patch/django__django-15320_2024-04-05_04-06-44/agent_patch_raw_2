Given the feedback that the initial patch did not resolve the issue and some tests have failed, let's consider an alternative approach. The issue might not solely be about the presence of parentheses but rather how the `Subquery` is integrated into the larger SQL statement. A more robust solution might involve ensuring that the `Subquery` is correctly recognized and handled as a subquery in all contexts, possibly by explicitly marking it as such and adjusting the handling in `as_sql` accordingly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>        self.query = getattr(queryset, 'query', queryset)
        self.extra = extra
        super().__init__(output_field)</original>
<patched>        self.query = getattr(queryset, 'query', queryset)
        self.extra = extra
        # Explicitly mark this query as a subquery
        self.query.subquery = True
        super().__init__(output_field)</patched>
```

This modification explicitly sets the `subquery` attribute to `True` on the `query` object within the `Subquery` constructor. This change aims to ensure that the query is always recognized as a subquery by the rest of the Django ORM, potentially influencing how it's handled in SQL generation and avoiding the need for string manipulation that leads to errors.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
<original>        template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql[1:-1]</original>
<patched>        # Check if explicit subquery marking is present and adjust SQL accordingly
        if hasattr(self.query, 'subquery') and self.query.subquery:
            template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql
        else:
            template_params['subquery'] = subquery_sql[1:-1]</patched>
```

This second modification adjusts the `as_sql` method to respect the `subquery` attribute if present. If the query is explicitly marked as a subquery, it no longer attempts to strip the first and last characters from the `subquery_sql` string, addressing the issue of invalid SQL generation by preserving the original formatting.

Together, these modifications aim to resolve the issue by ensuring that subqueries are correctly identified and handled within the Django ORM, thus generating valid SQL without resorting to potentially error-prone string manipulation.
