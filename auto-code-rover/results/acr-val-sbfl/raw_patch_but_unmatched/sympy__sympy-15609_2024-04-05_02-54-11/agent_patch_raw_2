Given the nature of the issue and the code provided, it seems the problem lies in how the LaTeX representation of matrix element subscripts is generated, particularly when dealing with summation indices in matrix multiplication. However, the exact code responsible for generating the LaTeX string with the incorrect subscript format was not directly provided in the snippets retrieved. 

The issue described involves an incorrect LaTeX representation (`_i_1` instead of `i_1` or similar), which suggests a problem in the naming or formatting of temporary variables (indices) in the LaTeX output. Without direct access to the LaTeX generation code, a precise patch cannot be formulated. 

However, a conceptual approach to address this issue would involve locating the code responsible for generating LaTeX representations of `MatrixElement` objects and ensuring that indices are formatted correctly there. This would likely be in a method responsible for converting symbolic expressions into LaTeX code, possibly in a file related to LaTeX printing or symbolic expression formatting, rather than in the `__getitem__` or `__new__` methods of `MatrixExpr` or `MatrixElement` classes.

Given the limitations, I recommend reviewing the LaTeX printing functionality within SymPy, particularly focusing on how indices for matrix elements are converted into LaTeX code. The goal would be to ensure that temporary indices in summations are formatted correctly, avoiding double subscripts or other formatting issues that LaTeX cannot compile. 

For a more targeted approach, developers should look into the `latex` function or method within SymPy that handles the conversion of symbolic expressions to LaTeX strings, specifically how it deals with `MatrixElement` objects and their indices.
