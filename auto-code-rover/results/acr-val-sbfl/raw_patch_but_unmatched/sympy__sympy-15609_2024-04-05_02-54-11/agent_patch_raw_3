Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears that a direct patch cannot be provided without specific insight into the LaTeX generation code for matrix expressions in SymPy. The issue at hand involves the generation of LaTeX code that results in a double subscript error when compiling. This problem likely stems from the way matrix element indices are handled during the generation of LaTeX strings, particularly in expressions involving sums over indexed elements.

Without direct access to the specific part of the code that generates these LaTeX strings, I can only suggest a conceptual approach to resolving the issue:

1. Locate the part of the SymPy codebase responsible for generating LaTeX representations of matrix expressions, particularly those involving indexed elements and summations.
2. Modify the LaTeX generation logic to ensure that temporary indices in summations are formatted correctly, avoiding LaTeX syntax that would result in compilation errors (e.g., double subscripts).

A hypothetical patch might look something like this, assuming the existence of a method responsible for generating LaTeX strings for matrix elements:

# Hypothetical modification
```python
<file>sympy/printing/latex.py</file>  # Hypothetical file path
<original>
# Hypothetical original code snippet that incorrectly formats the indices, leading to double subscript errors.
</original>
<patched>
# Corrected code that properly formats the indices, ensuring the generated LaTeX string is compilable.
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the LaTeX string generation for matrix expressions is handled in a file similar to `sympy/printing/latex.py`, and that the issue can be resolved by adjusting how indices are formatted in the generated LaTeX code.

To effectively address the issue, developers should:
- Identify the specific method(s) in the SymPy codebase that generate LaTeX strings for matrix expressions.
- Review and adjust the logic for formatting indices in these LaTeX strings, ensuring compatibility with LaTeX compilation requirements.

I apologize for the inability to provide a direct patch without more specific information on the code responsible for the LaTeX string generation. The resolution of this issue will require a detailed review of the SymPy codebase, particularly the parts responsible for LaTeX output.
