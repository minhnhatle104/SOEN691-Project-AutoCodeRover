Given the nature of the issue with `KernelPCA` and the analysis that the observed behavior (differences in signs of the results) is not a bug but an inherent characteristic of the PCA process, there's no direct "bug" to patch in the traditional sense. The eigenvectors' signs can indeed flip without changing the overall solution's correctness due to the mathematical properties of eigendecomposition.

However, for users who require consistent sign orientation across different runs for interpretability or other reasons, one could consider implementing a feature or utility function that post-processes the `KernelPCA` results to ensure consistent sign orientation based on a chosen convention. This is not fixing a bug per se but providing a tool for users to achieve their specific needs.

Below is a hypothetical patch that introduces a utility function to adjust the signs of the `KernelPCA` components (`alphas_`) based on the first non-zero element in each component being positive. This approach is one of many possible conventions.

```python
<file>sklearn/decomposition/_kernel_pca.py</file>
<original></original>
<patched>def adjust_kpca_signs(kpca):
    """
    Adjusts the signs of the KernelPCA components to ensure the first non-zero element of each component is positive.

    Parameters:
    kpca: KernelPCA
        The KernelPCA object after fitting.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    for i in range(kpca.alphas_.shape[1]):
        column = kpca.alphas_[:, i]
        first_non_zero_idx = np.where(column != 0)[0][0]
        if column[first_non_zero_idx] < 0:
            kpca.alphas_[:, i] = -1 * column
</patched>
```

Please note, this patch does not directly modify the `KernelPCA` class but provides an additional utility function that can be used after fitting `KernelPCA` to adjust the signs of the components. Users would need to call this function manually after fitting their model. This approach ensures that the core functionality of `KernelPCA` remains unchanged and backward compatible, while still offering a solution for users needing consistent sign orientation. 

This patch is conceptual and would need to be tested and validated within the sklearn development environment, including adherence to sklearn's contribution guidelines, code style, and integration with the existing sklearn testing suite.
