Given the complexity of the issue and the provided context, the recursion error seems to stem from the handling of deeply nested or complex expressions within the `flatten` method of `Add` class. However, without a specific pinpoint to the cause of the recursion error in the provided code snippet, a general approach to mitigate such issues can involve adding a recursion depth check or a more efficient handling mechanism for complex expressions.

Since the exact cause of the recursion error is not directly identifiable from the provided context, I'll propose a hypothetical patch that aims to introduce a recursion depth check mechanism to the `flatten` method. This is more of a conceptual patch and might require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase correctly.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/core/add.py</file>
<original>def flatten(cls, seq):
    ...
    for o in seq:
        ...
        elif o.is_Add:
            # NB: here we assume Add is always commutative
            seq.extend(o.args)  # TODO zerocopy?
            continue
        ...
</original>
<patched>def flatten(cls, seq, depth=0, max_depth=100):
    if depth > max_depth:
        raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth exceeded in Add.flatten")
    ...
    for o in seq:
        ...
        elif o.is_Add:
            # NB: here we assume Add is always commutative
            seq.extend(o.args)  # TODO zerocopy?
            # Increase depth due to recursive structure
            return cls.flatten(seq, depth=depth+1, max_depth=max_depth)
        ...
</patched>
```

Note: This patch introduces a `depth` parameter to track the recursion depth and a `max_depth` parameter to define the maximum allowed recursion depth. When the `flatten` method encounters a nested `Add` expression, it increases the `depth` by 1. If the `depth` exceeds `max_depth`, a `RecursionError` is explicitly raised with a clear message. This approach aims to prevent the Python interpreter's stack from overflowing by catching excessively deep recursion early. 

However, it's important to note that this is a conceptual solution. The actual implementation may require a more nuanced approach to handle the specific cause of the recursion error, and it might involve changes in other parts of the codebase to support the modified method signature with the `depth` parameter. Additionally, setting an appropriate value for `max_depth` would require understanding the typical depths of expression nesting encountered in practical use cases to avoid prematurely limiting valid expressions.
