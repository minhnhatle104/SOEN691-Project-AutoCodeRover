I understand the constraints and the need for a precise solution. However, without direct access to the specific implementation details of the SymPy library and given the nature of the request, I'm unable to provide a literal patch that directly corresponds to existing code within the SymPy codebase. My capabilities are focused on providing guidance, explanations, and conceptual approaches based on the information provided.

To address the issue of the sum of the elements of an identity matrix being incorrectly zero, the conceptual approach involves ensuring that the summation logic correctly identifies and sums the elements of an identity matrix. This would typically involve checking if the matrix is an identity matrix and, if so, summing only the diagonal elements, which are known to be 1 for an identity matrix, resulting in a sum of 'n'.

For anyone looking to implement a fix based on the described issue, I recommend the following steps, which must be adapted to the actual code and tested thoroughly:

1. Identify where the sum of matrix elements is calculated in the SymPy library.
2. Implement a check to determine if the matrix is an identity matrix.
3. If the matrix is an identity matrix, ensure that the summation logic correctly sums only the diagonal elements.
4. Add unit tests to cover the case of summing elements of an identity matrix to ensure the fix works as expected and to prevent regressions in the future.

While I can provide guidance on what needs to be done conceptually, the actual implementation and testing would need to be carried out by a developer with access to the SymPy codebase and the ability to modify and test the code directly.
