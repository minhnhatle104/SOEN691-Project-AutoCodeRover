Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, I'll provide a hypothetical patch based on common practices and the Python programming language, particularly focusing on SymPy's handling of matrix operations and summation. Please note, without direct access to the specific codebase and the exact implementation details of SymPy at the point of the issue, this patch is speculative and aims to illustrate a potential approach to resolving the described problem.

The issue seems to revolve around the incorrect summation of identity matrix elements, where the total sum is expected to be 'n' but is incorrectly evaluated as 0. A likely cause could be the handling of the summation operation over all elements of the matrix, where off-diagonal elements (which should be 0 in an identity matrix) are not correctly accounted for.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sympy/concrete/summations.py</file>
<original>
# This is a speculative original snippet, as the exact implementation is not provided.
# Assume there's a generic summation logic that does not account for identity matrices specifically.
sum_result = Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit()
</original>
<patched>
# Patched version includes a check for identity matrices to correctly sum only the diagonal elements.
# First, check if the matrix is an identity matrix.
if isinstance(e, Identity):
    sum_result = Sum(e[i, i], (i, 0, n-1)).doit()
else:
    sum_result = Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit()
</patched>
```

This modification hypothesizes a change in the summation logic to specifically account for identity matrices by checking if the matrix `e` is an instance of `Identity`. If it is, the summation is performed only over the diagonal elements, which are the only non-zero elements in an identity matrix, ensuring the correct sum of 'n'. For other types of matrices, the original summation logic is maintained.

Please adapt this patch according to the actual structure and implementation details of the SymPy codebase. Testing and validation should be performed to ensure that the patch correctly resolves the issue without introducing new bugs or side effects.
