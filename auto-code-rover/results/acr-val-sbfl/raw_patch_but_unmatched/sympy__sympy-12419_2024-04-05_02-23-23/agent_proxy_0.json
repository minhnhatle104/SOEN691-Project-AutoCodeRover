This will help in understanding how identity matrices are handled in the codebase, which is crucial for addressing the issue described. The methods mentioned are `_eval_transpose`, `_eval_inverse`, and `conjugate`, all within the `Identity` class. Additionally, I will search for the `Sum` method usage, as the issue specifically mentions an unexpected result when calculating the total sum of the elements of an identity matrix.\n\nHere are the API calls I will make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Identity\")` - This will help in understanding how identity matrices are defined and handled.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_eval_transpose\", \"Identity\")` - To see how the transpose of an identity matrix is evaluated.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_eval_inverse\", \"Identity\")` - To understand how the inverse of an identity matrix is calculated, which could be relevant to the issue since the matrix M.T * M is expected to be an identity matrix.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"conjugate\", \"Identity\")` - To check how the conjugate of an identity matrix is handled, which might influence the sum calculation.\n5. `search_method(\"Sum\")` - To understand how the `Sum` method is implemented, which is directly related to the bug since the issue arises when calculating the total sum of the elements of an identity matrix."
