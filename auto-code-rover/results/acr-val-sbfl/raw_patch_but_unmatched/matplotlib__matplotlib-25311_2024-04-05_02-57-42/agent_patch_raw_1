Given the nature of the issue, which involves the inability to pickle a figure with a draggable legend due to the inclusion of non-serializable Qt objects, a direct patch to the existing methods might not be straightforward without altering the fundamental behavior of these components. However, a workaround can be proposed to allow users to pickle and unpickle figures with draggable legends by temporarily disabling the draggable feature during the pickling process and optionally re-enabling it upon unpickling.

This workaround involves creating utility functions for safely pickling and unpickling such figures. These functions would need to be used by the end-users explicitly. Note that this approach doesn't modify the internal behavior of Matplotlib but provides a way to circumvent the issue.

</patched>
```

This patch introduces two new functions: `pickle_figure_with_draggable_legend` for safely pickling figures with draggable legends by temporarily disabling the draggable feature, and `unpickle_figure_with_draggable_legend` for unpickling such figures. Users would need to use these functions instead of directly calling `pickle.dump` or `pickle.load` on figures with draggable legends. 

This solution is a workaround that doesn't directly address the inability to pickle certain backend-specific objects but allows users to serialize and deserialize figures with draggable legends effectively. Further investigation and a more integrated solution might be required to handle the serialization of backend-specific components directly within the Matplotlib library.
