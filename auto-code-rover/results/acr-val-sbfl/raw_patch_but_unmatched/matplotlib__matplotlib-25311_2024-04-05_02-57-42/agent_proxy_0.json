Since the issue specifically mentions problems with pickling when the legend is set to draggable, we'll focus on these areas. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `set_draggable` method within the `Legend` class to understand its implementation and any potential issues related to pickling.\n2. Search for any method or class related to pickling figures in Matplotlib to understand how the figure is being serialized and why it might fail with `FigureCanvasQTAgg` objects.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"set_draggable\", \"Legend\")`\n- `search_class(\"FigureCanvasQTAgg\")`"
