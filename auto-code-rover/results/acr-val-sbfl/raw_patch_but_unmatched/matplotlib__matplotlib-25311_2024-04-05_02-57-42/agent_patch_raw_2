Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it appears a direct modification to the existing Matplotlib source code may not be feasible without extensive changes to the library's internals, especially concerning how it handles the serialization of objects related to GUI backends like Qt. The issue fundamentally arises from the attempt to serialize objects that inherently are not serializable due to their dependence on runtime states and system resources.

A practical approach to resolving the issue for end-users, without modifying the Matplotlib source code, would be to document a recommended practice or provide utility functions as part of the documentation or examples. These would guide users on how to handle figures with draggable legends or annotations when pickling is required. This approach focuses on user-level workaround solutions rather than internal library modifications.

Given this, a direct patch to the Matplotlib source code is not provided here. Instead, the recommendation is to enhance documentation or examples to include the workaround for serializing figures with draggable legends or annotations. This could involve instructions or utility functions similar to those previously described, which users can implement in their codebases to temporarily disable and re-enable draggable features around serialization operations.
