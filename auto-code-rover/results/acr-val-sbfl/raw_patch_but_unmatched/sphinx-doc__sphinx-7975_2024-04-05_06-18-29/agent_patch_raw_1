Given the constraints of our interaction, I don't have direct access to the actual source code of the Sphinx project or the specific details of the implementation related to the issue of duplicate "Symbols" sections in the HTML output. However, based on the general understanding of the issue and common practices in handling index entries and HTML generation in documentation tools like Sphinx, I can propose a hypothetical patch that could address the problem described. This patch is speculative and should be adapted to the actual codebase.

### Hypothetical Patch

The issue described involves the handling of index entries with special symbols, leading to two "Symbols" sections in the HTML output. A likely cause could be the sorting or categorization logic that does not uniformly handle all symbols, possibly treating some symbols differently due to their ASCII values or other characteristics.

Without access to the specific code, let's assume the logic for categorizing index entries into sections (including a "Symbols" section) is found in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`, and it might look something like this:

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py</file>
<original>
def categorize_index_entries(entries):
    # Hypothetical function for categorizing index entries
    symbol_section = []
    for entry in entries:
        if entry[0] in ['@', '£', '←']:  # This is a simplified condition
            symbol_section.append(entry)
    # Other categorization logic
    return sections
</original>
<patched>
def categorize_index_entries(entries):
    # Updated function for categorizing index entries
    symbol_section = []
    for entry in entries:
        if entry[0].isalnum():  # Change condition to check for alphanumeric characters
            continue  # Skip alphanumeric characters
        else:
            symbol_section.append(entry)
    # Other categorization logic
    return sections
</patched>
```

This hypothetical patch changes the logic for determining which entries go into the "Symbols" section. Instead of explicitly listing symbols that should be included, it checks if the first character of an entry is not alphanumeric (using `isalnum()`). If it's not alphanumeric, it's considered a symbol. This approach should ensure that all symbols are grouped together, potentially resolving the issue of duplicate "Symbols" sections by not splitting symbols based on specific characters.

Please note, this patch is speculative and based on a general understanding of the issue. The actual implementation in Sphinx may differ significantly, and the actual code will need to be reviewed and modified accordingly.
