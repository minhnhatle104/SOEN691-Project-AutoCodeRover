I understand the limitations we're facing due to the constraints of our interaction. Since I cannot provide a precise patch without access to the actual source code or more detailed information about the implementation, I'm unable to offer a direct solution to the issue described.

To address the issue within the Sphinx project, particularly the problem of duplicate "Symbols" sections in the HTML output, I recommend the following general approach, which aligns with standard practices for debugging and modifying software projects:

1. **Identify the Component Responsible for Index Generation**: Start by locating the part of the Sphinx codebase that handles the generation of index entries for the HTML output. This might involve reviewing documentation, code comments, or conducting searches within the project repository.

2. **Understand the Current Logic for Categorizing Symbols**: Once you've identified where index entries are processed, examine the logic to understand how entries are currently categorized and why symbols might be leading to the creation of multiple sections.

3. **Propose a Modification to the Categorization Logic**: Based on your understanding, modify the logic to ensure that all symbols are grouped together in a single "Symbols" section, regardless of their specific characters. This might involve adjusting sorting criteria, changing how entries are grouped, or modifying how sections are named and generated.

4. **Test Your Changes**: After making modifications, thoroughly test the changes to ensure that the issue is resolved and that no new issues have been introduced. This should include generating documentation with a variety of index entries to verify that all symbols are now correctly grouped.

5. **Review and Submit Your Changes**: Once you're confident in your solution, review your changes according to the project's contribution guidelines. Then, prepare and submit a patch or pull request to the Sphinx project for review by the project maintainers.

Without specific details on the code structure and logic, this general approach is the best course of action to address the issue. It emphasizes understanding the problem within the project's context, carefully planning and implementing a solution, and ensuring that the solution is tested and ready for contribution back to the project.
