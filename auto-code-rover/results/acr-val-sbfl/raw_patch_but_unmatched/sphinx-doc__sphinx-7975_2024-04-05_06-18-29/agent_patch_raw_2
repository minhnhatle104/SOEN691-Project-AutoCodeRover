Given the constraints of our interaction and the lack of direct access to the specific implementation details within the Sphinx project, I'm unable to provide an exact patch that directly corresponds to the actual source code. My previous response was a speculative approach based on common patterns in handling such issues within documentation generation tools, intended to illustrate a potential strategy for resolving the described problem.

Without the ability to view the actual source code or the specific implementation details related to the handling of index entries and the generation of HTML output in Sphinx, any attempt to provide a precise patch would be purely hypothetical and might not accurately reflect the structure or logic of the Sphinx codebase.

To contribute effectively to resolving the issue, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Review the Relevant Source Code**: Directly examine the files and methods identified as potentially related to the issue, such as `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`, focusing on the logic for processing and categorizing index entries.

2. **Identify the Specific Logic**: Look for the specific logic that determines how index entries are categorized into sections, especially how entries with special symbols are handled. This could involve sorting functions, categorization conditions, or the generation of section headers and anchors in the HTML output.

3. **Consult Sphinx Documentation and Community**: The Sphinx documentation for developers, as well as forums or community discussions, might provide insights into common issues and recommended practices for handling index entries and HTML output.

4. **Develop and Test a Patch**: Based on your understanding of the issue and the Sphinx codebase, develop a patch that addresses the problem. Test the patch thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems.

5. **Contribute Back**: If your patch successfully resolves the issue, consider contributing it back to the Sphinx project through the appropriate channels, such as a pull request on the project's repository, following the project's guidelines for contributions.

I apologize for any confusion and hope these recommendations help guide your efforts to resolve the issue within the Sphinx project.
