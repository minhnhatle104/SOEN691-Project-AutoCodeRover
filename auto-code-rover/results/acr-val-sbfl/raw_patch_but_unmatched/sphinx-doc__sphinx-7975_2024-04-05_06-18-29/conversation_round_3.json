The issue description suggests that the problem lies in how different symbols are being sorted or grouped in the index, leading to two separate \"Symbols\" sections. Given the external analysis tool's output, it seems that the issue might not be directly related to the methods listed, as they pertain to EPUB building rather than HTML output or index generation.\n\nHowever, to get a better understanding of where the issue might be stemming from, we should look into how the index is generated and how symbols are handled. Since the issue specifically mentions the HTML output and the handling of symbols in index entries, we should focus on classes or methods that are likely involved in index generation or HTML output formatting.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the nature of the issue, the following API calls could provide valuable insights:\n\n1. Search for classes or methods related to index generation or handling of symbols in index entries. This might involve classes or methods responsible for sorting, categorizing, or generating index sections.\n2. Since the issue mentions HTML output, it would also be useful to look for methods involved in generating or formatting HTML content, especially those that might be responsible for creating sections or anchors.\n\nGiven the lack of specific class or method names related to index generation or HTML formatting in the issue description or the tool output, we'll start with a broad search that might help narrow down the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n- search_code(\"index generation\")\n- search_code(\"HTML output\")\n- search_code(\"Symbols section\")\n\nThese searches aim to find code snippets related to the generation of the index and handling of symbols, which could lead to identifying the parts of the code responsible for the issue."

However, the search for \"HTML output\" yielded several results, indicating potential areas of interest for further investigation. The files mentioned could be involved in generating HTML content, including the index or handling of special characters and symbols in the HTML output.\n\nHere's a summary of the files where \"HTML output\" was found, which might be relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **sphinx/addnodes.py** - This file could contain custom nodes used by Sphinx in generating documentation, possibly including nodes related to index entries or symbols.\n2. **sphinx/application.py** - This file might deal with the Sphinx application's overall behavior, including how it processes and outputs HTML.\n3. **sphinx/domains/__init__.py** - Domains in Sphinx are a way of grouping related functionality, such as Python objects, C++ objects, etc. This file might contain generic functionality related to domains that could affect HTML output.\n4. **sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py** - The autosummary extension generates summary listings of functions, classes, etc. It could be involved in how index entries are summarized or displayed in HTML.\n5. **sphinx/environment/collectors/title.py** - This file might be involved in collecting titles for use in the HTML output, which could include handling of symbols or special characters in titles.\n\nGiven this context, the next step would be to investigate these files further to understand how they might contribute to the issue of having two \"Symbols\" sections in the HTML output. Specifically, we should look for how index entries are processed, how symbols are categorized or sorted, and how sections and anchors in the HTML output are generated and named.\n\nTo proceed, we can focus on the files that are most likely to contain relevant code related to the issue:\n\n- **sphinx/addnodes.py** and **sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py** seem like promising starting points, as they could directly deal with how index entries and summaries are generated, including handling of symbols.\n\nLet's perform more targeted searches within these files to find relevant code snippets or methods:\n\n- search_code_in_file(\"index\", \"sphinx/addnodes.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"symbols\", \"sphinx/addnodes.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"index\", \"sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"symbols\", \"sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py\")\n\nThese searches aim to narrow down the investigation to specific sections of the code that might be responsible for the observed issue."

Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n1. **sphinx/addnodes.py**: \n   - This file contains references to \"index\" both outside of functions and within a `setup` function. However, there were no findings related to \"symbols\" in this file. The presence of \"index\" related code suggests that `sphinx/addnodes.py` could be involved in handling index-related functionality, which might be relevant to the issue of duplicate \"Symbols\" sections in the HTML output.\n\n2. **sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py**: \n   - No references to \"index\" or \"symbols\" were found in this file. This suggests that the autosummary extension might not be directly involved in the issue at hand, or the keywords used for the search did not match the relevant code sections.\n\nGiven the above findings, the most promising lead appears to be within `sphinx/addnodes.py`, particularly the references to \"index\" found both outside of functions and within the `setup` function. Since there were no direct references to \"symbols\", the issue might not be explicitly about how symbols are handled but rather how index entries are processed and categorized, leading to the unintended creation of two \"Symbols\" sections.\n\n### Analyzing Collected Context\n\nThe absence of direct references to \"symbols\" handling in the search results suggests that the issue might be more subtle, possibly related to how index entries are sorted or categorized rather than explicit handling of symbol characters. The presence of index-related code in `sphinx/addnodes.py` indicates that this file plays a role in index generation or manipulation, which could be where the issue originates.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the current context, the next step would be to closely examine the code in `sphinx/addnodes.py`, especially the parts outside of functions and within the `setup` function that reference \"index\". Understanding how index entries are processed in these sections could reveal why two \"Symbols\" sections are being generated.\n\n### Bug Locations\n\nBased on the analysis, the likely location of the bug is within:\n\n- **Buggy File**: `sphinx/addnodes.py`\n- **Buggy Methods/Sections**: References to \"index\" both outside of functions and within the `setup` function.\n\nTo move forward, a detailed review of these sections in `sphinx/addnodes.py` is necessary to identify the specific code responsible for the issue and to devise a suitable patch."
