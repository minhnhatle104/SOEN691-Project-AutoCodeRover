Given the constraints and the nature of the request, creating a precise patch without direct access to the specific codebase or the exact implementation details is challenging. However, I can guide you on the general approach to resolving the issue based on Django's migration system and common practices for addressing deprecation warnings related to `Meta.index_together` transitioning to `Meta.indexes`.

Since a direct patch cannot be accurately provided without the actual code, I recommend the following steps to manually address the issue in your Django project:

### Step 1: Update Model Meta
For any models using `index_together`, update them to use `Meta.indexes` with `models.Index`. This change directly addresses the deprecation warning by using the recommended approach for defining indexes in Django.

### Example Change in a Model Definition
Before:
```python
class MyModel(models.Model):
    # model fields

    class Meta:
        index_together = [["field1", "field2"]]
```

After:
```python
class MyModel(models.Model):
    # model fields

    class Meta:
        indexes = [models.Index(fields=['field1', 'field2'], name='my_custom_index_name')]
```

### Step 2: Modify Migration Files
For existing migration files that reference `index_together`, consider manually editing them to use the `AddIndex` operation from `django.db.migrations.operations` instead, if the automatic migration does not handle this transition smoothly.

### Example Migration Modification
Before:
```python
# Generated migration file
operations = [
    migrations.AlterIndexTogether(
        name='mymodel',
        index_together=set([("field1", "field2")]),
    ),
]
```

After:
```python
# Manually updated migration file
from django.db import migrations, models

operations = [
    migrations.AddIndex(
        model_name='mymodel',
        index=models.Index(fields=['field1', 'field2'], name='my_custom_index_name'),
    ),
]
```

### Step 3: Squashing Migrations
If you're squashing migrations and encounter issues with deprecation warnings, ensure that the squashed migrations correctly use the `Meta.indexes` approach. This might involve manually editing the squashed migration file to ensure it's using the updated index definition method.

### General Note
These steps are a general guide and should be adapted based on the specific details of your project and the Django version you are using. Always test migration changes thoroughly in a development environment before applying them to production to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce issues.

This approach aims to guide you through manually resolving the issue described, given the limitations of providing a direct patch without access to the specific codebase.
