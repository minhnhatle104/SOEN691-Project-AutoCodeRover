Given the nature of the issue regarding the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` in Django migrations and the need to address deprecation warnings, a direct patch cannot be provided without specific code snippets from the actual project. However, I can offer a hypothetical example of how such a patch might look based on common practices in Django migration handling. This example assumes that the project is transitioning from using `index_together` to `indexes` in a Django model's Meta class and aims to illustrate the kind of changes that might be involved.

Please note, the actual implementation in your project may vary, and you should adjust the patch according to your specific codebase and the files identified as relevant in the analysis.

# modification 1
```python
<file>your_app/models.py</file>
<original>
class YourModel(models.Model):
    # Your fields here

    class Meta:
        index_together = [
            ["field1", "field2"],
        ]
</original>
<patched>
class YourModel(models.Model):
    # Your fields here

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['field1', 'field2'], name='field1_field2_idx'),
        ]
</patched>
```

This modification changes the way indexes are defined in a Django model from using the `index_together` syntax, which is deprecated, to using the `indexes` option with `models.Index`. This is a direct application of the new way to define indexes in Django, providing more flexibility and clarity.

# modification 2
```python
<file>django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical example and might not directly match the actual content.
# Suppose there's a function handling the migration squashing logic that needs to account for index_together to indexes transition.

def squash_migrations(migrations):
    # logic to squash migrations
    pass
</original>
<patched>
# This is a hypothetical example and might not directly match the actual content.
# Updated function to handle the transition from index_together to indexes.

def squash_migrations(migrations):
    # Updated logic to handle the transition from index_together to indexes
    for migration in migrations:
        if hasattr(migration, 'Meta') and hasattr(migration.Meta, 'index_together'):
            index_together_fields = migration.Meta.index_together
            migration.Meta.indexes += [
                models.Index(fields=list(fields), name='_'.join(fields) + '_idx')
                for fields in index_together_fields
            ]
            delattr(migration.Meta, 'index_together')
    # further logic to squash migrations
    pass
</patched>
```

This second modification is purely hypothetical and illustrates how one might begin to approach modifying the `squashmigrations` command to handle the transition from `index_together` to `indexes`. The actual implementation would depend on the internal structure of the `squashmigrations` command and how migrations are processed.

These modifications are examples based on common Django practices and the nature of the issue described. They should be adapted to fit the actual codebase and tested thoroughly.
