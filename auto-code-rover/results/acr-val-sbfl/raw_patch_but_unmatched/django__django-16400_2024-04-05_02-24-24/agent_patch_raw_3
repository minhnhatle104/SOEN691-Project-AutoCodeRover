Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, it seems we're facing a conceptual misunderstanding in applying a direct patch to the provided snippets, primarily because the issue lies in the interaction between Django's migration system and the custom database routing logic, rather than a straightforward bug within the provided code snippets.

The issue described involves the Django migration command not respecting the specified database parameter when interacting with the database, particularly in the context of a multi-tenant application with custom middleware and database routers. The provided code snippets and the analysis suggest that the problem might not be within these snippets themselves but rather in how the custom database router and possibly Django's migration framework handle the database parameter.

Given this understanding, a direct patch to the provided snippets might not be feasible without a broader context of the Django migration command's implementation and the custom database router's logic. However, the initial suggestion aimed to ensure that the custom database router respects the database parameter by checking for a 'database' hint within its methods. This approach remains conceptually valid but cannot be directly applied without seeing the exact implementation of the custom database router and how it's invoked during migrations.

Therefore, without the ability to directly modify Django's internal mechanisms or the full implementation details of the custom database router, we're at an impasse in providing a patch that directly addresses the issue as described.

In real-world scenarios, addressing such an issue might involve:
- Reviewing the custom database router's implementation to ensure it properly handles the 'database' parameter or hint passed during migrations.
- Investigating how Django's migration framework invokes database routers and whether it correctly passes the 'database' parameter or any hints that could be used by the router to determine the correct database.
- Consulting Django's documentation or source code to understand better how database parameters should be handled during migrations and whether there are known limitations or behaviors in multi-tenant setups.

This situation highlights the complexities of working with custom implementations and extensions within frameworks like Django, where issues might arise from the interaction between custom logic and the framework's expected behaviors.
