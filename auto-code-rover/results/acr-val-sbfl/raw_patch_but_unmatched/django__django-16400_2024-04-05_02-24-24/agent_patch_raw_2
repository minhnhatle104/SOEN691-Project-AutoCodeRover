Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, it appears a direct patch to the provided code snippets may not fully address the underlying problem, which seems to involve the broader interaction between Django's migration system and the custom database routing logic in a multi-tenant setup. Without direct access to modify Django's internal handling of database connections during migrations or a clear indication that the provided snippets are where the fault lies, we're somewhat speculative.

However, understanding the importance of providing a meaningful direction, let's conceptualize an adjustment that could potentially mitigate the issue by ensuring that Django's migration command respects the specified database parameter. This involves ensuring that the custom database router (not fully shown in the snippets) properly handles the database alias during migrations.

Since the exact mechanism by which the `migrate` command passes the database alias to the router isn't detailed in the snippets provided, and given the complexity of Django's ORM and migration system, any modification is somewhat speculative. However, a general approach could involve ensuring that the custom database router checks for a migration-specific hint or context that specifies the target database.

Assuming that the custom database router (`TenantDatabaseRouter`) might be missing logic to respect the database alias provided during migrations, and acknowledging that the exact implementation details are speculative, below is a conceptual approach to modifying the router to consider a migration-specific hint:

# modification 1
```python
<file>utils/tenant_db_router.py</file>
<original>def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
    print("read", hints)
    return self._default_db()

def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
    print("write", hints)
    return self._default_db()</original>
<patched>def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
    # Attempt to respect a specified database alias during migrations
    if 'database' in hints:
        return hints['database']
    print("read", hints)
    return self._default_db()

def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
    # Attempt to respect a specified database alias during migrations
    if 'database' in hints:
        return hints['database']
    print("write", hints)
    return self._default_db()</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the `hints` dictionary, which is passed to the `db_for_read` and `db_for_write` methods of the database router, can include a 'database' key specifying the database alias to use, particularly during operations initiated by the migration command. This approach is speculative and based on the assumption that such a mechanism could be utilized to ensure the specified database parameter is respected throughout the migration process.

Please note, this is a conceptual patch based on the information provided and the understanding of Django's migration and database routing systems. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific project setup, Django's version, and how the migration command interacts with database routers in the context of the project.
