Given the constraints and the context provided, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the request for a direct patch application. Since the actual original code snippet from `sympy/printing/latex.py` was not provided, the "original" section was filled with a placeholder comment, which does not match any existing code in the file. Therefore, a direct patch cannot be applied in the format requested without the exact original code to modify. 

However, the proposed solution still stands as a conceptual fix for the issue. To integrate this fix into the project, a developer would need to:

1. Open the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file.
2. Add the provided `_print_Trace` method implementation to the appropriate class handling LaTeX printing, typically a subclass of `Printer` or a similar class designed for LaTeX output in SymPy.

This method does not directly replace an existing snippet but adds new functionality to handle `Trace` objects correctly in LaTeX printing. Therefore, the exact location within the file where this method should be added depends on the structure of the `latex.py` file and the specific class responsible for LaTeX printing. 

For a more precise application, one would need to review the `latex.py` file, identify the correct class for LaTeX printing (often `LatexPrinter` or similar), and add the new method there.
