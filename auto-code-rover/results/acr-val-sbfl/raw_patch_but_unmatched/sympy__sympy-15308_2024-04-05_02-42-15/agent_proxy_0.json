The external analysis tool has pointed out several suspicious methods that could be related to this issue. Given this information, we will perform the following API calls to get more context:\n\n1. Search for the `Trace` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that might be involved in LaTeX printing.\n2. Search for the method `__new__` in the `Trace` class to see how `Trace` objects are instantiated, which might give us clues on how they are processed for LaTeX printing.\n3. Search for any LaTeX printing related methods or functions in the codebase to understand how expressions are converted to LaTeX format.\n\nTherefore, the API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"Trace\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__new__\", \"Trace\")`\n- `search_code(\"latex\")`"
