<patched>def _print_Trace(self, expr):
    from sympy.printing.latex import latex
    # Use the LaTeX representation for the argument of Trace
    arg_latex = latex(expr.arg)
    # Format it as Trace with the argument in LaTeX form
    return '\\mathrm{Tr}\\left(' + arg_latex + '\\right)'</patched>
```

Explanation:
This patch adds a new method `_print_Trace` to `sympy/printing/latex.py` for handling the LaTeX printing of `Trace` objects. Since the issue was that `Trace` expressions were not being printed correctly in LaTeX format, this method explicitly formats such expressions with the LaTeX command for trace (`\mathrm{Tr}`) and applies LaTeX formatting to the argument of the `Trace` object. This ensures that `Trace` expressions and their inner expressions are correctly recognized and printed in LaTeX format.
