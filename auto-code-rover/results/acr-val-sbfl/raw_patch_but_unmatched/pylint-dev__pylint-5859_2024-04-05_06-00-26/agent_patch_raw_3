Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, it's clear that providing a direct and applicable patch to the pylint codebase is not feasible without specific details on the implementation and structure of the code. My previous attempts were conceptual and aimed to illustrate the general approach one might take to address the issue described. However, without access to the actual code and its precise structure, these conceptual patches cannot be directly applied.

To truly resolve the issue described, a developer would need to:

1. **Review the actual implementation** of the `_validate` function in `pylint/config/option.py` to understand how it handles the validation of option values, particularly for the `--notes` option. Adjustments may be needed to ensure that punctuation-based note tags are not improperly filtered out or invalidated.

2. **Examine the logic** within `pylint/checkers/misc.py` that is responsible for generating `W0511` warnings based on note tags. This would involve understanding how the `--notes` option values are processed and ensuring that punctuation-based tags are correctly identified and trigger warnings as expected.

Given these steps, the resolution would involve modifying the validation logic to correctly handle punctuation-based note tags and adjusting the warning generation logic to ensure these tags are recognized and processed as intended.

Unfortunately, without the ability to directly view and interact with the pylint codebase through this platform, I cannot provide a more specific or directly applicable patch. The resolution of this issue would best be pursued within the development environment with access to the pylint source code, enabling detailed analysis and testing.
