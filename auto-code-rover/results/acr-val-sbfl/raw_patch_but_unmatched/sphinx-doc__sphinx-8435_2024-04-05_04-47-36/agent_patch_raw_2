Given the limitations and the context provided, creating an exact patch without direct access to the specific implementation details for handling variables and attributes in the Sphinx codebase is challenging. The issue described involves `autodoc_type_aliases` not affecting variables and attributes, but the provided snippets focus on functions, methods, and classes without showing how variables and attributes are documented.

Since the exact code handling variables and attributes documentation—where the application of `autodoc_type_aliases` is missing or failing—was not provided, I cannot offer a precise patch. A proper fix would require modifying the part of the Sphinx autodoc extension that processes documentation for variables and attributes to ensure `autodoc_type_aliases` are applied. This would likely involve identifying where type annotations for variables and attributes are retrieved and formatted, then ensuring `autodoc_type_aliases` are considered in this process.

Without specific code snippets showing how variables and attributes are currently handled, any proposed patch would be speculative. The correct approach to resolving the issue would involve:

1. Identifying the code within the Sphinx autodoc extension that handles the documentation of variables and attributes.
2. Modifying this code to apply `autodoc_type_aliases` to the type annotations of variables and attributes, similar to how it's done for function and method parameters.

Developers working on this issue should review the Sphinx autodoc extension's source code to locate the relevant sections and implement the necessary changes. This process would also involve testing the modifications to ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` are correctly applied to variables and attributes in the generated documentation, without introducing any regressions or unintended behavior.
