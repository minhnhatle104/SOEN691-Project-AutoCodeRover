Given the context and the issue at hand, the core problem seems to be that `autodoc_type_aliases` is not being applied to variables and attributes documentation. The provided code snippets primarily focus on functions, methods, and classes. To address the issue, we need to ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` is also considered when Sphinx autodoc processes variables and attributes.

However, based on the provided code snippets, there's no direct indication of where variables and attributes are specifically handled or where the application of `autodoc_type_aliases` to them is missing or failing. A common approach in such documentation tools is to handle variables and attributes in a similar manner to function and method parameters, but the provided snippets do not show this part of the code.

Given this limitation, I'll propose a hypothetical patch that would extend the use of `autodoc_type_aliases` to variables and attributes. This patch assumes there's a part of the code responsible for handling the documentation of variables and attributes, similar to how parameters and return types are handled in functions and methods.

# modification 1
```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original code snippet where variables and attributes are processed
# without considering `autodoc_type_aliases`, as the specific implementation details are not provided.
def document_variable_or_attribute(self, obj):
    # Hypothetical method for documenting a variable or attribute
    type_annotation = get_type_annotation(obj)
    return format_annotation(type_annotation)
</original>
<patched>
from typing import get_type_hints

def document_variable_or_attribute(self, obj):
    # Updated method to consider `autodoc_type_aliases` when documenting a variable or attribute
    type_annotation = get_type_annotation(obj)
    # Retrieve the global type aliases from the Sphinx configuration
    type_aliases = self.config.autodoc_type_aliases
    # Apply type aliases to the type annotation if applicable
    resolved_annotation = resolve_type_annotation(type_annotation, type_aliases)
    return format_annotation(resolved_annotation)

def resolve_type_annotation(annotation, type_aliases):
    # Utility function to apply type aliases to a given annotation
    if annotation in type_aliases:
        return type_aliases[annotation]
    return annotation
</patched>
```

This modification is purely illustrative and assumes a specific structure and method names that might not exist in the actual Sphinx codebase. The real implementation would require identifying the exact location and mechanism through which Sphinx processes and documents variables and attributes, and then applying a similar logic to ensure `autodoc_type_aliases` are considered.

Without direct access to the specific parts of the code where variables and attributes are documented, it's challenging to provide an exact patch. The modification above serves as a conceptual guide on how to approach the issue based on the patterns observed in the handling of functions, methods, and classes within the provided snippets.
