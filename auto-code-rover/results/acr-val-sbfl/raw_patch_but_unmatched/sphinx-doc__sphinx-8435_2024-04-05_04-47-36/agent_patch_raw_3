Given the constraints and the nature of the issue with `autodoc_type_aliases` not affecting variables and attributes in Sphinx documentation, and without direct access to the specific parts of the code that handle the documentation generation for variables and attributes, it's challenging to provide a precise and applicable patch.

The issue at hand suggests a need for a modification in the Sphinx autodoc extension to ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` are applied not just to function signatures but also to variables and attributes. However, the provided code snippets and the analysis focus on functions, methods, and classes, without direct references to the handling of variables and attributes.

In the absence of specific code handling the documentation of variables and attributes, a hypothetical approach to address the issue would involve ensuring that wherever Sphinx's autodoc extension processes type annotations for variables and attributes, it also considers the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration.

A general approach to creating a patch would involve:

1. Identifying the part of the Sphinx autodoc extension that retrieves and processes type annotations for variables and attributes.
2. Modifying this part to apply the `autodoc_type_aliases` mapping to the type annotations before they are used in the documentation.

Since we cannot provide a direct patch without the specific implementation details, the recommendation for developers facing this issue is to trace the documentation generation process for variables and attributes within the Sphinx autodoc extension. Once the relevant code is identified, developers should ensure that `autodoc_type_aliases` is consulted and applied to type annotations during the documentation generation process.

This approach would ensure that the documentation reflects the type aliases as defined in the `conf.py` file, thereby resolving the issue. Developers would also need to add or modify existing tests to cover this case, ensuring that the application of `autodoc_type_aliases` to variables and attributes works as expected and does not introduce regressions.
