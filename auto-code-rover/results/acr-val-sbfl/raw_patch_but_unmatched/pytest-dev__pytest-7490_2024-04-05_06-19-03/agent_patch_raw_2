Given the constraints and the information provided, creating a direct and applicable patch without access to the full source code and without a clear indication of the bug's root cause in the provided snippets is challenging. The issue described involves dynamically adding `xfail` markers not being recognized correctly in pytest 6.0.0rc0, which suggests a problem with the marker processing system or the test execution protocol.

Without specific lines of code that directly relate to the handling of dynamically added markers or without a clear indication of what changed from pytest 5.x to 6.0.0rc0 that could cause this issue, any attempt to provide a patch would be speculative.

In a real-world scenario, the next steps would involve:
- Reviewing the pytest changelog and commit history between 5.x and 6.0.0rc0 to identify changes related to marker processing or test execution.
- Debugging the pytest codebase with a focus on how markers are added to test items and how these markers influence the test execution protocol.
- Engaging with the pytest development community for insights or known issues related to this behavior in 6.0.0rc0.

Given these limitations, I cannot provide a direct and actionable patch. I recommend further investigation based on the steps outlined above.
