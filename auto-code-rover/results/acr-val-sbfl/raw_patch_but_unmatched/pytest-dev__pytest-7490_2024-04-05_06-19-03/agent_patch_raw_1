Given the context and the issue at hand, the problem seems to revolve around the dynamic addition of `xfail` markers not being properly recognized in pytest 6.0.0rc0. The provided code snippets do not directly show how markers are processed or how the dynamic addition of markers is handled. However, based on the understanding of pytest's architecture and the issue described, a plausible approach to patching this issue would involve ensuring that dynamically added `xfail` markers are correctly recognized and processed during the test collection and execution phases.

Since the exact cause of the issue is not directly visible in the provided snippets and without the ability to run and test the code, I will propose a conceptual patch that could be applied to the pytest framework to address issues related to marker processing. This patch assumes that the problem might be related to the integration between the marker system and the assertion rewriting system, which does not properly account for dynamically added markers.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/mark/structures.py</file>
<original>
def add_marker(self, marker):
    """Adds a marker to this node."""
    self.own_markers.append(marker)
</original>
<patched>
from _pytest.nodes import Item

def add_marker(self, marker):
    """Adds a marker to this node and reevaluates the item's markers if it's a test item."""
    self.own_markers.append(marker)
    if isinstance(self, Item):
        self._reevaluate_dynamic_markers()

def _reevaluate_dynamic_markers(self):
    """Reevaluates dynamic markers for this test item."""
    for marker in self.iter_markers(name="xfail"):
        if marker.kwargs.get("condition", True):
            self.add_marker(pytest.mark.xfail(reason=marker.kwargs.get("reason", "")))
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/main.py</file>
<original>
def pytest_runtest_protocol(item, nextitem):
    ...
    # Existing code for running test protocol
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def pytest_runtest_protocol(item, nextitem):
    ...
    # Ensure dynamic markers are reevaluated before test execution
    if hasattr(item, "_reevaluate_dynamic_markers"):
        item._reevaluate_dynamic_markers()
    ...
    # Existing code for running test protocol
    ...
</patched>
```

These modifications are conceptual and aim to illustrate a potential approach to ensuring that dynamically added `xfail` markers are processed correctly. The first modification introduces a method to reevaluate dynamic markers on a test item, specifically looking for `xfail` markers added dynamically and ensuring they are processed. The second modification ensures that this reevaluation happens before the test execution protocol runs.

Please note, these patches are hypothetical and would need to be tested and refined within the actual pytest codebase. The actual implementation may require adjustments based on the pytest's internal architecture and the specifics of how markers and test items are managed.
