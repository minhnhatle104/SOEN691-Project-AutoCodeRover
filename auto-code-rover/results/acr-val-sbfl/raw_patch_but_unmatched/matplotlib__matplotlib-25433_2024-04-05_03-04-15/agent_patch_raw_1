Based on the issue described and the context retrieved, the problem seems to stem from how the figure is cleared (`pyplot.clf()`) and redrawn (`pyplot.draw()`) within the `on_changed` callback of a `RangeSlider`, which affects the state and event bindings of widgets. A direct patch to the Matplotlib library might not be the most appropriate solution, as the issue is more about how these methods are used rather than a bug in their implementation. However, a workaround can be suggested for the user's code to avoid the problem.

The user's code could be modified to selectively update the figure without completely clearing it, which would preserve the state of existing widgets and their event bindings. This approach involves removing specific elements that need to be updated and then redrawing the figure, rather than clearing the entire figure.

Here's a conceptual patch for the user's code, assuming the goal is to update the content of the figure without losing widget functionality:

# modification 1
```python
<file>user_code.py</file>
<original>
pyplot.clf()
addElements()
pyplot.draw()
</original>
<patched>
# Assuming `addElements` is designed to add new elements to the figure,
# modify it to first remove specific elements that need to be updated.
# This avoids using pyplot.clf() which clears the entire figure and resets its state.

# Example modification inside the addElements function:
# Instead of clearing the figure, remove specific elements.
for artist in list(ax.figure.gca().get_children()):
    if isinstance(artist, matplotlib.widgets.Slider) or isinstance(artist, matplotlib.widgets.Button):
        artist.remove()
addElements()
pyplot.draw()
</patched>
```

This modification assumes that the `addElements` function is responsible for adding widgets to the figure. The patch suggests modifying `addElements` to first remove specific elements (e.g., old sliders or buttons) that need to be updated, rather than clearing the entire figure with `pyplot.clf()`. This way, the figure's state and the event bindings of existing widgets are preserved.

Note: This is a conceptual patch and might require adjustments based on the full context of the user's code. The actual implementation might vary depending on how the figure and its elements are managed in the user's application.
