Given the context of the issue and the analysis we've conducted, let's draft a hypothetical patch to add a `version_info` tuple to Matplotlib. This patch assumes the current structure of Matplotlib's codebase based on the provided information and standard Python practices.

### Modification 1: Define `version_info` in `_version.py`

This modification introduces the `version_info` tuple in the `_version.py` file, which is assumed to be responsible for managing version-related information.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
# Assuming the file contains a version string like:
__version__ = "3.4.2"
</original>
<patched>
# Importing the necessary library for LooseVersion, if decision favors LooseVersion over version_info tuple.
from distutils.version import LooseVersion

__version__ = "3.4.2"
# Adding a version_info tuple based on the __version__ string.
version_info = tuple(int(x) for x in __version__.split('.')[:3])

# Alternatively, if LooseVersion is preferred:
# version = LooseVersion("3.4.2")
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Utilize `version_info` in `__init__.py` for Version Checks

This modification updates the `__init__.py` file to utilize the newly introduced `version_info` for internal version checks, replacing or supplementing string-based comparisons.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# Example of a version check using the __version__ string.
if __version__ < "3.4.0":
    raise ImportError("Matplotlib version 3.4.0 or higher is required")
</original>
<patched>
# First, ensure that version_info is imported at the top of the file.
from . _version import version_info

# Then, update the version check to use version_info.
if version_info < (3, 4, 0):
    raise ImportError("Matplotlib version 3.4.0 or higher is required")
</patched>
```

### Modification 3: Document the Introduction of `version_info`

This modification suggests updating the documentation to include information about the `version_info` tuple, guiding users on how to use it for version comparison.

```python
<file>doc/users/whats_new.rst</file>
<original>
# Assuming there's a section for new features in the documentation.
</original>
<patched>
# Adding a new section or paragraph about version_info.
New in 3.4.3: Matplotlib now includes a `version_info` tuple in `matplotlib._version`, which provides a structured way to compare version numbers. You can use this tuple like so:

```python
from matplotlib import version_info
if version_info < (3, 4, 0):
    print("Update Matplotlib to use this feature.")
```
</patched>
```

These modifications provide a hypothetical approach to addressing the issue of adding easily comparable version information to Matplotlib, enhancing usability for version checks.
