I understand the situation and the limitations we're working within. Given that we're operating in a hypothetical scenario without access to the actual Matplotlib codebase and cannot directly apply or test patches, let's focus on providing a conceptual solution that outlines the necessary steps and considerations for adding a `version_info` tuple to Matplotlib. This conceptual solution aims to guide someone with access to the Matplotlib codebase on how to implement this feature.

**Conceptual Solution for Adding `version_info` to Matplotlib**

1. **Define `version_info` in `_version.py`**

   - **Objective**: Introduce a `version_info` tuple based on the current version string (`__version__`).

   - **Rationale**: A tuple allows for easy comparison of version numbers in a more structured and Pythonic way.

   - **Example Change**:
     ```python
     __version__ = "3.4.2"
     version_info = tuple(int(part) for part in __version__.split('.')[:3])
     ```

2. **Utilize `version_info` in Version Checks**

   - **Objective**: Replace or supplement string-based version comparisons with tuple-based comparisons using `version_info`.

   - **Rationale**: Tuple comparisons are more reliable and readable, especially for numerical version parts.

   - **Example Change**:
     ```python
     from ._version import version_info

     if version_info < (3, 4, 0):
         raise ImportError("Matplotlib version 3.4.0 or higher is required")
     ```

3. **Document the Introduction of `version_info`**

   - **Objective**: Update the Matplotlib documentation to include information about the `version_info` tuple.

   - **Rationale**: Documentation will help users understand how to use the new version comparison method.

   - **Example Change**:
     ```rst
     New in version 3.4.3: Matplotlib now includes a `version_info` tuple in `matplotlib._version`, providing a structured way to compare version numbers. This feature allows for more precise version checks.
     ```

4. **Testing**

   - **Objective**: Ensure that the new `version_info` tuple works as expected and does not introduce any regressions.

   - **Rationale**: Testing is crucial to verify the functionality and maintain the stability of the library.

   - **Example Approach**: Write unit tests that compare `version_info` against known version tuples to ensure correct behavior.

5. **Backward Compatibility**

   - **Objective**: Maintain the existing `__version__` string for backward compatibility.

   - **Rationale**: External scripts and libraries may rely on the `__version__` string for version checks.

   - **Consideration**: Ensure that both `__version__` and `version_info` are maintained and updated together in future releases.

This conceptual solution provides a roadmap for adding a `version_info` tuple to Matplotlib, focusing on the steps and considerations necessary to implement this feature in a way that enhances usability and maintains backward compatibility.
