Given the constraints and the hypothetical nature of this task, let's revise the approach to crafting a patch for adding a `version_info` tuple to Matplotlib, considering the typical structure of Python projects and common practices. Since we cannot directly match the original program's exact code structure, this revised patch will focus on a general approach that could be adapted to the specific implementation details of Matplotlib.

### Modification 1: Define `version_info` in `_version.py`

This modification introduces the `version_info` tuple in the `_version.py` file. This file is assumed to manage version-related information for Matplotlib.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/_version.py</file>
<original>
# This is a hypothetical original snippet, assuming the file primarily defines __version__.
__version__ = "3.4.2"
</original>
<patched>
__version__ = "3.4.2"
# Introduce version_info based on __version__
version_info = tuple(int(part) for part in __version__.split('.')[:3])
</patched>
```

### Modification 2: Utilize `version_info` in `__init__.py` for Version Checks

This modification suggests a hypothetical change in the `__init__.py` file to utilize the `version_info` for internal version checks, aiming to replace or supplement string-based comparisons.

```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical original snippet showing a string-based version comparison.
if __version__ < "3.4.0":
    raise ImportError("Matplotlib version 3.4.0 or higher is required")
</original>
<patched>
# Assuming version_info is imported at the beginning of the file.
from ._version import version_info

# Updated version check using version_info.
if version_info < (3, 4, 0):
    raise ImportError("Matplotlib version 3.4.0 or higher is required")
</patched>
```

### Modification 3: Document the Introduction of `version_info`

This modification involves updating the documentation to include information about the `version_info` tuple, guiding users on how to use it for version comparison.

```python
<file>doc/users/whats_new.rst</file>
<original>
# Hypothetical placeholder for where new features are documented.
</original>
<patched>
# Documenting the introduction of version_info.
New in version 3.4.3: Matplotlib introduces a `version_info` tuple in `matplotlib._version`, providing a structured way to compare version numbers. This feature allows for more precise version checks:

```python
from matplotlib import version_info
if version_info < (3, 4, 0):
    print("Please update Matplotlib to use newer features.")
```
</patched>
```

Please note, these patches are based on a hypothetical scenario and may need adjustments to fit the actual codebase of Matplotlib. The intention is to illustrate a general approach to implementing the requested feature.
