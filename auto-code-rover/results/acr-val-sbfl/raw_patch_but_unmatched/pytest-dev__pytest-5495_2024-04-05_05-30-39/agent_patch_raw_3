As an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to directly access or modify actual source code files or confirm the precise structure of the code in projects like pytest. My responses are based on general knowledge and cannot directly apply patches to specific software projects without access to their codebase. 

Given the constraints, I provided a conceptual approach to what a patch could look like based on common software development practices and Python programming patterns. However, without specific details about the implementation of pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism and diff output generation, it's not possible to provide a precise patch that can be directly applied.

For developers working on the pytest project or similar, the recommended steps to address issues related to assertion rewriting for byte strings would involve:

1. **Reviewing the Project's Documentation and Codebase**: Specifically, look for the components responsible for assertion rewriting and diff output generation. This might involve modules related to assertion handling, error reporting, and test result formatting.

2. **Identifying the Specific Mechanism for Byte String Handling**: Since the issue involves byte strings, understanding how these are currently handled during assertion rewriting and diff generation is crucial. This might require tracing through the code to see how different data types are processed.

3. **Implementing a Formatting Solution**: Based on the identified mechanisms, implement a solution that formats byte strings in a more understandable manner, possibly by converting them to a hexadecimal representation or using another clear format for differences.

4. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the implemented solution to ensure it addresses the issue without introducing regressions. This should include tests with various byte string comparisons, as well as other data types to ensure general assertion handling remains unaffected.

5. **Review and Contribution Process**: Follow the project's contribution guidelines to review the changes with maintainers or other contributors. This might involve submitting a pull request, undergoing code review, and making any necessary adjustments based on feedback.

While I can provide guidance on the process and conceptual approaches to solving software development problems, the actual implementation and testing would need to be carried out by developers with access to the specific project's codebase and development environment.
