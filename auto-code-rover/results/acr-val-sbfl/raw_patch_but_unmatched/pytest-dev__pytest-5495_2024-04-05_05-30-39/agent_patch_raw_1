Given the constraints and the lack of specific details on the implementation of assertion rewriting and diff output generation for byte strings in pytest, I'll provide a hypothetical patch. This patch is based on a general understanding of how such features might be implemented in a testing framework like pytest. The goal is to improve the clarity of assertion failure messages involving byte strings by ensuring that differences in byte values are presented in a more understandable manner.

Please note, the following patch is speculative and intended as an illustrative example based on common practices and the context provided. It may not directly apply to pytest's actual codebase without modification.

# modification 1
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py</file>
<original>
def _compare_eq_iterable(left, right):
    diff = difflib.ndiff(pprint.pformat(left).splitlines(), pprint.pformat(right).splitlines())
    return '\n'.join(diff)
</original>
<patched>
import difflib
import pprint

def _format_byte_string(bs):
    """Format byte string for clearer diff output."""
    return ' '.join(f'{b:02x}' for b in bs)

def _compare_eq_iterable(left, right):
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        left_formatted = _format_byte_string(left)
        right_formatted = _format_byte_string(right)
        diff = difflib.ndiff([left_formatted], [right_formatted])
    else:
        diff = difflib.ndiff(pprint.pformat(left).splitlines(), pprint.pformat(right).splitlines())
    return '\n'.join(diff)
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```python
<file>src/_pytest/assertion/util.py</file>
<original>
def assertrepr_compare(config, op, left, right):
    # Existing code handling comparison and generating representation
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def assertrepr_compare(config, op, left, right):
    # Check if the comparison involves byte strings and enhance readability
    if op == "==" and isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        left_repr = ' '.join(f'{b:02x}' for b in left)
        right_repr = ' '.join(f'{b:02x}' for b in right)
        return [f'assert {left_repr}', f'       {op}', f'       {right_repr}']
    # Existing code handling other types of comparison and generating representation
    ...
</patched>
```

This hypothetical patch introduces a more readable format for byte strings in assertion failure messages by converting byte values to their hexadecimal representation. This approach aims to make the differences between expected and actual byte string values clearer to the user.

Remember, applying this patch would require thorough testing to ensure compatibility with existing functionality and to validate that it effectively addresses the issue without introducing new problems.
