Given the constraints and the nature of our interaction, I'm unable to directly access or modify actual source code files or confirm the precise structure of the code in the pytest project or any other. Therefore, creating a patch that directly matches the existing codebase without access to the specific implementation details is not feasible.

However, I can suggest a conceptual approach to addressing the issue based on common practices in software development and my understanding of Python and testing frameworks like pytest. This approach can guide developers familiar with the project in creating an actual patch.

### Conceptual Approach to Patching

The goal is to improve the assertion failure messages for byte strings by making the diff output more understandable. This involves formatting byte strings in a way that highlights their differences more clearly, possibly by representing them in hexadecimal format.

1. **Identify Where Byte String Comparisons are Handled**: 
   - Find the part of the code responsible for generating diff outputs for assertion failures. This might be in a utility module related to assertion handling or diff generation.

2. **Enhance Byte String Formatting**:
   - Implement a function to format byte strings into a more readable format (e.g., hexadecimal) before they are compared or when the diff is generated.

3. **Integrate the Formatting into the Assertion Workflow**:
   - Modify the assertion handling or diff generation code to use the new formatting function for byte strings.

### Conceptual Patch

```python
# Assuming a utility function for diff generation exists
def format_byte_string_for_diff(byte_string):
    """Format a byte string into a hexadecimal representation for clearer diffs."""
    return ' '.join(f'{b:02x}' for b in byte_string)

# Assuming there's a point in the code where diffs are generated
def generate_diff(expected, actual):
    # Conceptual check for byte strings
    if isinstance(expected, bytes) and isinstance(actual, bytes):
        expected_formatted = format_byte_string_for_diff(expected)
        actual_formatted = format_byte_string_for_diff(actual)
        # Generate and return the diff using the formatted byte strings
        # This part would involve the actual diff generation logic
    else:
        # Handle other types as before
```

This conceptual patch outlines a strategy for improving byte string diffs in pytest assertion failures. Actual implementation would require access to the pytest codebase, understanding of the specific modules and functions involved in assertion handling and diff generation, and adherence to pytest's coding standards and practices.

Developers looking to implement this patch should:
- Review the pytest codebase to locate the relevant modules and functions.
- Ensure compatibility with existing pytest features and tests.
- Consider the impact on performance and readability.
- Test thoroughly with a variety of byte strings and other data types to ensure the changes improve clarity without introducing regressions.
