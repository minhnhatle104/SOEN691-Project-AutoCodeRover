Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, without direct access to the original program's codebase and paths, I'll provide a conceptual patch based on common Django patterns and the details provided. This patch aims to address the issue of optional URL parameters causing crashes in some view functions when migrating from Django 2.2 to Django 3.0. Please adjust the file paths and code snippets according to your project's structure.

### Conceptual Patch

#### Modification 1: Adjusting the URL Pattern
To ensure compatibility with Django 3.0 and proper handling of the optional `format` parameter, the URL pattern might need to be adjusted. This adjustment ensures that the `format` parameter is correctly interpreted as optional.

```python
<file>your_project/urls.py</file>
<original>
re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
</original>
<patched>
from django.urls import re_path

urlpatterns += [
    re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>html|json|xml)?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
]
</patched>
```

**Explanation**: The modification simplifies the regex for the optional `format` parameter. The non-capturing group might not be necessary, and ensuring the parameter is correctly defined as optional (`?`) directly after its pattern should suffice. This change aims to make the URL pattern more explicitly compatible with Django 3.0's routing logic.

#### Modification 2: Ensuring Default Parameter Handling in the View
To address the potential issue of the view function receiving more positional arguments than expected, it's crucial to ensure that the `format` parameter is handled as an optional keyword argument with a default value.

```python
<file>your_project/views.py</file>
<original>
def modules(request, format='html'):
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def modules(request, format=None):
    format = format or 'html'
    ...
</patched>
```

**Explanation**: This modification explicitly sets a default value for the `format` parameter within the function body. This approach is more robust against potential issues with how arguments are passed to the function, ensuring that `format` has a default value even if it's not provided in the URL.

Please note that these modifications are conceptual and based on the information provided. You may need to adjust the file paths (`your_project/urls.py` and `your_project/views.py`) and the code snippets to fit the actual structure and content of your Django project. The aim is to address the issue by ensuring compatibility with Django 3.0's expectations for URL patterns and view function parameter handling.
