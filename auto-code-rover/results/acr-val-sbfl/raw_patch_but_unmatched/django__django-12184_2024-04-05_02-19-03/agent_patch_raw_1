Based on the issue described and the context retrieved, the problem seems to stem from the way optional URL parameters are handled in the view function when migrating from Django 2.2 to Django 3.0. The error indicates that the `modules` view function is receiving more positional arguments than expected, likely due to changes in Django's URL routing and parameter handling.

Given this, a potential patch would involve adjusting the URL pattern to ensure compatibility with Django 3.0's expectations for optional parameters and ensuring the view function correctly handles these parameters. Since I don't have access to the actual file paths or the complete original code, I'll provide a conceptual patch based on the information provided:

# modification 1
```python
<file>urls.py</file>
<original>
re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
</original>
<patched>
from django.urls import re_path

urlpatterns += [
    re_path(r'^module/(?:(?P<format>html|json|xml)/)?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
]
</patched>
```
**Explanation**: This modification adjusts the regex in the URL pattern to more explicitly handle the optional `format` parameter, ensuring that it's correctly interpreted as optional by Django 3.0. The use of `?:` in the regex makes the preceding group a non-capturing group, which is useful for grouping parts of the pattern without capturing the group in the resulting match. This change aims to clarify the intention of the optional `format` parameter and ensure compatibility with Django 3.0's URL routing logic.

# modification 2
```python
<file>views.py</file>
<original>
def modules(request, format='html'):
    ...
</original>
<patched>
def modules(request, format=None):
    if format is None:
        format = 'html'
    ...
</patched>
```
**Explanation**: This modification ensures that the `modules` view function explicitly checks for a `None` value for the `format` parameter and sets a default value of `'html'` if necessary. This approach provides additional clarity and control over how optional parameters are handled within the function, making the function's behavior more predictable and easier to debug.

These modifications aim to address the issue by ensuring that the URL pattern is correctly defined for Django 3.0 and that the view function is prepared to handle the optional `format` parameter in a way that matches the expectations of Django's URL routing and parameter passing logic.
