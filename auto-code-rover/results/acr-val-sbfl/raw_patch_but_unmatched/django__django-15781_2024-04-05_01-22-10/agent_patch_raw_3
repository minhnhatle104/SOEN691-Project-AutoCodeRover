Given the constraints and the nature of the feedback, it appears there's a misunderstanding regarding the ability to directly apply patches to an existing codebase or the Django framework itself through this platform. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I can provide guidance, generate code based on descriptions, and offer conceptual solutions, but I cannot directly interact with or modify external codebases, nor can I access or retrieve live data to perform actions such as applying patches in real-time.

The solution provided earlier is intended as a conceptual guide for developers facing similar issues with help text formatting in Django's management commands. It suggests a way to customize the help text formatting by subclassing `BaseCommand` and overriding the `create_parser` method to use a custom formatter class. This approach allows for greater control over the presentation of the help text without requiring modifications to Django's internal code.

For developers looking to implement a fix based on the provided guidance:

1. **Subclass `BaseCommand`**: Create a new management command by subclassing `BaseCommand`. This is a common practice in Django for adding custom management commands.

2. **Override `create_parser` Method**: In your subclass, override the `create_parser` method to specify a custom formatter class. This formatter class can inherit from `argparse` formatters like `RawTextHelpFormatter` or `HelpFormatter` and can be customized to handle multiline help text more gracefully.

3. **Adjust Help Text**: Format your command's help text according to the capabilities of your custom formatter. This might involve using raw string literals for multiline text or formatting the text in a way that's compatible with your formatter's parsing logic.

4. **Test Your Command**: After implementing your custom command and formatter, test the command using Django's management command infrastructure to ensure the help text appears as expected.

This approach provides a flexible and Django-idiomatic way to address issues with help text formatting in custom management commands. It leverages Django's extensibility and the capabilities of the `argparse` library, which Django uses for parsing command-line arguments in management commands.
