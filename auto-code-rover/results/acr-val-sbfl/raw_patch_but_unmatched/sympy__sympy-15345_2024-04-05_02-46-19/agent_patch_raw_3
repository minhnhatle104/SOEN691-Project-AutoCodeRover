Given the limitations and the information available, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be provided without more detailed insight into the `MCodePrinter` class's implementation, particularly how it handles the `Max` function or similar cases. Without access to the actual code structure and implementation details of the `MCodePrinter` within `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`, any attempt to provide a patch would be speculative and may not accurately address the issue.

In scenarios like this, the best course of action would be to directly examine the source code of the `MCodePrinter` class, identify how it handles the `Max` function, and then implement a fix that ensures the function is translated to Mathematica syntax correctly. This would typically involve modifying the method responsible for printing function expressions to handle the `Max` function specifically, ensuring it uses square brackets (`[]`) instead of parentheses (`()`).

Since a precise patch cannot be formulated based on the current constraints and information, I recommend reviewing the `MCodePrinter` class's implementation for the specific handling of the `Max` function and applying a fix based on the actual code structure and logic.
