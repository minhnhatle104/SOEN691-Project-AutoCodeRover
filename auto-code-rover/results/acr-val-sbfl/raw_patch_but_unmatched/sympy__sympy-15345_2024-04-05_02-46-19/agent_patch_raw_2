Given the constraints and the information provided, it appears that a direct patch cannot be formulated without more specific details about the implementation of the `MCodePrinter` class or how it handles the `Max` function specifically. Since the provided context does not include the implementation details of the `MCodePrinter` class or a method directly responsible for handling the `Max` function, the speculative patch cannot be accurately applied.

In a real-world scenario, the next step would involve examining the source code of the `MCodePrinter` class within `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` to identify the method responsible for handling the `Max` function. This would likely involve looking for a method that specifically handles function expressions or a dispatch mechanism that maps specific SymPy functions to their Mathematica counterparts.

Without access to the actual implementation details or the ability to directly query the source code further, it's challenging to provide a precise patch. The resolution to this issue would require access to the source code of the `MCodePrinter` class to make an informed modification that ensures the `Max` function is correctly translated to Mathematica syntax.

In practice, fixing this issue would involve:
1. Identifying the method within `MCodePrinter` that handles the translation of function expressions.
2. Modifying this method (or adding a new case) to ensure that the `Max` function is translated with square brackets (`[]`) instead of parentheses (`()`).

Developers working on the SymPy project would need to review the `MCodePrinter` class's source code to implement an effective patch.
