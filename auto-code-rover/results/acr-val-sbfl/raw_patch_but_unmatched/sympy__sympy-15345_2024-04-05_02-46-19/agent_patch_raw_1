To address the issue with the `mathematica_code` function generating incorrect Mathematica code for the `Max` function, we need to ensure that the `Max` function is correctly translated to Mathematica's syntax, which uses square brackets (`[]`) instead of parentheses (`()`). This involves modifying the `MCodePrinter` class, which is responsible for converting SymPy expressions to Mathematica code. Since the specific handling of the `Max` function within the `MCodePrinter` class was not provided, I'll outline a general approach to patching this issue.

Assuming the `MCodePrinter` class uses a method similar to other printers for handling functions, we would need to add or modify a method within this class to correctly handle the `Max` function. Below is a hypothetical patch that demonstrates how this could be achieved. Note that this patch is speculative and assumes the structure of the `MCodePrinter` class is similar to other function printers in SymPy.

```python
<file>sympy/printing/mathematica.py</file>

# Assuming there's a generic method for handling functions that doesn't correctly handle `Max`
def _print_Function(self, expr):
    func_name = expr.func.__name__
    args = ', '.join(self.doprint(arg) for arg in expr.args)
    return f"{func_name}({args})"
</original>
<patched>
# Add a specific case for handling the `Max` function
def _print_Function(self, expr):
    func_name = expr.func.__name__
    if func_name == "Max":
        args = ', '.join(self.doprint(arg) for arg in expr.args)
        return f"{func_name}[{args}]"  # Use square brackets for Mathematica syntax
    else:
        args = ', '.join(self.doprint(arg) for arg in expr.args)
        return f"{func_name}({args})"
</patched>
```

This patch assumes that the `MCodePrinter` class uses a method named `_print_Function` to handle generic function printing and that this method does not correctly differentiate between functions that should use parentheses and those that should use square brackets, such as `Max`. By adding a specific case for `Max`, we ensure that it is correctly translated to Mathematica's syntax. 

Please note, the actual implementation may vary based on the existing structure of the `MCodePrinter` class, and the class might use a different method or approach to handle specific functions like `Max`. Therefore, the actual patch might need to adapt to the specifics of the `MCodePrinter` implementation.
