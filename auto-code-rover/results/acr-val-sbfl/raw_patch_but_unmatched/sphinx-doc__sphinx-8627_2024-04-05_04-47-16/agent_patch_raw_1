Given the constraints of this environment and the lack of direct access to the Sphinx codebase or specific details about the implementation of the autodoc extension and its handling of type annotations, it's not feasible to write an accurate and applicable patch for the issue described. However, I can provide a hypothetical approach to addressing the issue based on standard practices for extending Sphinx and handling type annotations.

### Hypothetical Patch Approach:

The issue described involves Sphinx's autodoc extension not being able to resolve `struct.Struct` type annotations. A potential solution could involve extending Sphinx's autodoc to better handle or explicitly recognize `struct.Struct` annotations. This might involve creating a custom Sphinx extension or modifying the autodoc extension's source code to include special handling for `struct.Struct`.

### Hypothetical Modification 1: Extending Type Handling in Autodoc

```python
<file>sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</file>
<original>
# This is a placeholder for the original code snippet where type annotations are processed.
</original>
<patched>
from sphinx.util.inspect import safe_getattr
import struct

def process_signature(app, what, name, obj, options, signature, return_annotation):
    # This is a hypothetical function where we extend Sphinx's handling of signatures.
    if return_annotation is struct.Struct:
        # Custom handling for struct.Struct return annotations
        return_annotation = ':class:`struct.Struct`'
    return signature, return_annotation

def setup(app):
    app.connect('autodoc-process-signature', process_signature)
</patched>
```

### Hypothetical Modification 2: Registering a Custom Domain for Struct

```python
<file>sphinx/domains/python.py</file>
<original>
# Placeholder for the section where Python domain objects are registered.
</original>
<patched>
from sphinx.domains.python import PythonDomain

class StructDirective(PythonDomain):
    """
    Directive to handle struct.Struct type annotations explicitly.
    """
    # Implementation details for handling struct.Struct references.

def setup(app):
    app.add_domain(StructDirective, override=True)
</patched>
```

### Conclusion:

These modifications are hypothetical and intended to illustrate a potential approach to solving the issue with `struct.Struct` type annotations in Sphinx documentation. The actual implementation would require a detailed review of the Sphinx source code, specifically the autodoc extension and potentially the Python domain handling within Sphinx. Additionally, testing and validation would be necessary to ensure that these changes effectively resolve the issue without introducing unintended side effects.

For a real-world solution, it's recommended to engage with the Sphinx community, review the Sphinx documentation and source code, and potentially contribute a patch or feature request to the Sphinx project on platforms like GitHub.
