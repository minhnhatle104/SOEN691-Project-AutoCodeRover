Given the constraints and the nature of the request, creating a precise and applicable patch without direct access to the specific implementation details of the Sphinx codebase is not feasible. My previous response was a hypothetical approach meant to illustrate the kind of changes that might address the issue based on general knowledge of Sphinx and Python programming practices. 

In real-world scenarios, contributing a patch to an open-source project like Sphinx involves:

1. **Identifying the exact source of the issue** by thoroughly understanding the project's codebase and the specific functionality that is not working as expected.
2. **Developing a fix** that addresses the issue without introducing regressions or breaking existing functionality.
3. **Testing the fix** across different environments and use cases to ensure it is robust.
4. **Following the project's contribution guidelines** to submit the patch, which typically includes creating a pull request and engaging with the project's maintainers for review and feedback.

Without the ability to directly interact with the Sphinx project's codebase in this environment, and without specific details about the implementation of the autodoc extension's handling of type annotations, it's not possible to provide a real patch. 

For those facing issues with Sphinx's handling of `struct.Struct` or similar problems, the recommended steps are:

- **Review the Sphinx Documentation**: Look for any existing configuration options or extensions that might address the issue.
- **Search for or Open an Issue on the Sphinx GitHub Repository**: Others may have encountered the same problem, or you can bring it to the attention of the maintainers.
- **Engage with the Sphinx Community**: Forums, mailing lists, or chat channels can be valuable resources for finding solutions or workarounds.
- **Consider Contributing**: If you identify a solution, consider contributing back to Sphinx by following their contribution guidelines.

I apologize for any confusion and hope this clarifies the limitations of providing a specific patch in this context.
