Given the constraints and the information provided, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the request for a specific code patch. Since the issue described involves the unexpected presence of a `__dict__` attribute on `Symbol` instances in SymPy version 1.7, despite the use of `__slots__`, and there's no direct indication of a mistake in the provided `Symbol` class definition, a specific code patch cannot be accurately formulated without further investigation into the broader codebase or changes between versions.

The issue likely stems from subtleties in Python's handling of `__slots__` in inheritance or a change elsewhere in SymPy that inadvertently affects `Symbol` instances. Without the ability to inspect the full codebase or the changes introduced in version 1.7, any attempt to provide a patch would be speculative and potentially misleading.

Therefore, I must clarify that without additional context or the ability to analyze the relevant changes in the codebase, I cannot provide a meaningful patch to resolve the described issue. The resolution would require a detailed review of the SymPy codebase, specifically focusing on the implementation and inheritance of the `Symbol` class and any related changes made in version 1.7.
