Explanation:
- The patch proposes a modification to ensure that `Symbol` instances do not inadvertently create a `__dict__` attribute, which contradicts the intended use of `__slots__` for memory efficiency. 
- The `__new__` method is overridden to include a check for the existence of `__dict__` on newly created instances. If `__dict__` exists, it raises an AttributeError, signaling that the instance creation does not align with the expected behavior given the `__slots__` definition.
- This approach maintains the integrity of the `Symbol` class's design, ensuring that instances remain lightweight and that any unintended introduction of `__dict__` is flagged immediately.
- Note: The additional imports and the `with_metaclass` usage are placeholders and should be adjusted based on the actual project structure and Python version compatibility requirements. The core idea is to enforce the absence of `__dict__` in a way that integrates with the class's existing architecture.
