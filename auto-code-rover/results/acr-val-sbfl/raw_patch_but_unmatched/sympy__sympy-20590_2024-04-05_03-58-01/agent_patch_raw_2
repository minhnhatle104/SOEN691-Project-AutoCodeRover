Given the context and the issue described, it appears there's no direct modification needed in the provided code snippet to address the issue of `Symbol` instances unexpectedly having a `__dict__` attribute in version 1.7, as the code correctly uses `__slots__`. The presence of `__dict__` might be due to a deeper issue in the inheritance chain or a change in Python's behavior regarding `__slots__` and inheritance. However, without a clear indication of a mistake in the `Symbol` class definition or a misunderstanding of Python's `__slots__` mechanism, proposing a specific code change to the `Symbol` class itself might not resolve the issue.

Instead, a more thorough investigation into how `Symbol` instances are being created and whether any changes in the inheritance chain or object creation process in version 1.7 could have led to this behavior is warranted. This would require access to the full codebase and a detailed changelog between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7, which is beyond the scope of this simulation.

Therefore, without a specific code snippet identified as causing the issue and based on the provided context, it's not possible to offer a valid patch. The next steps would involve a deeper dive into the SymPy codebase, particularly focusing on changes made around the `Symbol` class and its parent classes, as well as any global changes to class creation or `__slots__` handling in version 1.7.
