Given the nature of the issue, which involves the inability to pickle figures after aligning labels due to the use of a non-pickleable `weakref.ReferenceType` object within the `self._align_label_groups`, a potential patch would involve ensuring that all objects within `self._align_label_groups` are pickleable. However, without direct access to the underlying implementation details of how `self._align_label_groups` is used and managed, a precise patch cannot be provided. 

A general approach to solving this issue would involve either:
1. Ensuring that `self._align_label_groups` does not hold or manage `weakref.ReferenceType` objects in a way that prevents pickling.
2. Implementing custom pickling methods (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`) for the `FigureBase` class to properly handle the pickling of `self._align_label_groups`.

Since the specific implementation details and dependencies of `self._align_label_groups` are not provided, below is a conceptual patch that outlines how one might implement custom pickling methods for the `FigureBase` class to bypass the pickling issue:

# modification 1
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>class FigureBase:
    ...
    def align_labels(self, axs=None):
        ...
</original>
<patched>class FigureBase:
    ...
    def align_labels(self, axs=None):
        ...
    
    def __getstate__(self):
        state = self.__dict__.copy()
        # Remove the non-pickleable entries.
        state['_align_label_groups'] = None
        return state

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        # Restore instance attributes (i.e., filename and lineno).
        self.__dict__.update(state)
        # Reinitialize non-pickleable entries.
        self._align_label_groups = {}
</patched>
```

This patch is conceptual and aims to illustrate how one might approach resolving the pickling issue by removing or handling non-pickleable objects during the pickling process. The actual implementation would need to consider the specific requirements and usage of `self._align_label_groups` within the `FigureBase` class to ensure that label alignment functionality is preserved and that no data is lost during the pickling and unpickling processes.
