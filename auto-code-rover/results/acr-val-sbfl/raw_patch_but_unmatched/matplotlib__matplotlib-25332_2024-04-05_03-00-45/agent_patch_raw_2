Given the constraints and the nature of the issue, a direct patch to the specific problem of pickling figures after using `align_labels()` in matplotlib, which involves handling non-pickleable objects like `weakref.ReferenceType`, cannot be accurately provided without more detailed insight into the internal workings of `self._align_label_groups`. However, a conceptual approach to address similar issues involves implementing custom serialization methods for the class that contains non-pickleable objects. 

Since a direct patch cannot be applied without further context, below is a revised conceptual approach that outlines how one might implement custom serialization methods (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`) for a class to manage non-pickleable objects during the pickling process. This approach is generic and would need adaptation to fit the specific implementation details of the `FigureBase` class in matplotlib.

# Conceptual modification
```python
<file>lib/matplotlib/figure.py</file>
<original>class FigureBase:
    ...
    # Existing implementation of FigureBase without custom pickling methods.
    ...
</original>
<patched>class FigureBase:
    ...
    # Existing methods and attributes of FigureBase.
    ...
    
    def __getstate__(self):
        state = self.__dict__.copy()
        # Assuming '_align_label_groups' contains non-pickleable objects, remove or handle them.
        if '_align_label_groups' in state:
            # Example: Convert non-pickleable objects to a pickleable format or remove them.
            state['_align_label_groups'] = pickleable_version_of(state['_align_label_groups'])
        return state

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        # Restore instance attributes.
        self.__dict__.update(state)
        # Reinitialize or convert back any specially handled objects.
        if '_align_label_groups' in state:
            self._align_label_groups = original_version_of(state['_align_label_groups'])
    
    # Example helper functions to convert to and from a pickleable version.
    # These functions would need to be implemented based on the actual structure and requirements of '_align_label_groups'.
    def pickleable_version_of(self, obj):
        # Convert to a pickleable format.
        return obj

    def original_version_of(self, obj):
        # Convert back to the original format.
        return obj
</patched>
```

This conceptual modification outlines a strategy for handling non-pickleable objects within a class that needs to be serialized. The actual implementation of `pickleable_version_of` and `original_version_of` would depend on the specific requirements and data structures used in `self._align_label_groups`. The goal is to ensure that all parts of the object's state can be pickled and unpickled correctly, preserving the functionality and data integrity of the class across serialization processes.
