Given the constraints and the inability to directly access or modify the actual source code or execute real-time search API calls, I'll provide a conceptual approach to how a patch could be formulated based on the described issue and the analysis provided. This approach is intended to guide developers in investigating and resolving the issue within their development environment.

### Conceptual Patch Approach

The issue described involves extra lines of code being printed in error messages when using assertions in pytest with Python 3.9, which was not the case in Python 3.7. Based on the analysis, the focus is on how the source code range is determined for error messages, particularly looking at the `getstatementrange_ast` function in `src/_pytest/_code/source.py`.

#### Understanding the Issue:
- The problem might stem from how the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is parsed and used to determine the range of source code to display in error messages.
- Differences in AST handling or parsing between Python versions could lead to discrepancies in the determined source code range.

#### Conceptual Patch:
1. **Review and Adjust AST Parsing:**
   - Examine how `getstatementrange_ast` parses the AST and determines the start and end lines for the source code range. Ensure compatibility with changes in the AST structure or behavior introduced in Python 3.9.

2. **Ensure Accurate Line Number Determination:**
   - Verify that the starting line number for the source code range is accurately determined, avoiding the inclusion of unrelated code lines. This might involve adjusting how decorators or multiline statements are handled.

3. **Test Across Python Versions:**
   - Conduct thorough testing across different Python versions, especially focusing on the transition from Python 3.7 to 3.9, to identify any version-specific behavior affecting the issue.

#### Hypothetical Code Adjustments:
While I cannot provide direct code modifications that match the original program, a developer might consider the following areas for adjustments:
- **Adjusting AST Node Handling:** Modify the logic within `getstatementrange_ast` to better accommodate changes in AST node structures or properties introduced in Python 3.9.
- **Enhancing Line Range Calculation:** Implement more robust checks or heuristics to accurately determine the relevant source code range, possibly by refining how the start line is calculated in the presence of decorators or other syntactic elements.

### Final Note:
This conceptual approach aims to guide further investigation and resolution efforts. Developers should review the actual implementation details within their environment, considering the insights and potential areas of focus identified through the analysis.
