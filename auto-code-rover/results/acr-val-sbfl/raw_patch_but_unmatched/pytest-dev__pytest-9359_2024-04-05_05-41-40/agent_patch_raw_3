Given the constraints and the nature of the issue described, I'll provide a conceptual explanation of how a patch might be approached rather than specific code changes, as I cannot directly access or modify the actual source code.

### Conceptual Patch Explanation

The issue involves extra lines of code being printed in error messages when using assertions in pytest with Python 3.9, which suggests a problem with how the traceback is formatted or how the source code range is determined for display in error messages.

#### Key Areas to Investigate:

1. **Traceback Formatting:**
   - The mechanism for formatting tracebacks and including source code snippets in error messages may need to be reviewed. This involves how pytest utilizes the traceback information to construct the error message.

2. **Source Code Range Determination:**
   - The logic for determining the range of source code lines to display in the error message is crucial. The issue suggests that the range might be incorrectly calculated, including lines that should not be part of the error context.

3. **Decorator Handling:**
   - Since the extra lines in the error message are related to a decorator, it's important to investigate how decorators are handled in the context of error reporting. There might be a need to adjust how the starting line of the relevant code block is determined when decorators are involved.

#### Conceptual Approach to Patching:

- **Review Traceback Handling Code:**
  - Examine the code responsible for handling tracebacks and extracting source code snippets. Ensure it correctly identifies the start and end lines for the code block relevant to the error.

- **Adjust Source Code Range Logic:**
  - Modify the logic that calculates the source code range to ensure it accurately identifies the relevant lines, especially in the presence of decorators or other Python constructs that might affect line numbering.

- **Enhance Decorator Handling:**
  - Implement or refine special handling for decorators to ensure they do not incorrectly influence the determination of the source code range for error messages.

- **Test Across Python Versions:**
  - Conduct thorough testing across different Python versions, especially between Python 3.7 and 3.9, to identify any changes in behavior that might affect traceback formatting or source code range determination.

### Note:

This explanation provides a high-level overview of how one might approach resolving the issue based on the information provided. Actual implementation would require access to the specific sections of the pytest codebase where traceback handling and source code range determination are implemented, as well as testing to confirm that the changes address the issue without introducing new problems.
