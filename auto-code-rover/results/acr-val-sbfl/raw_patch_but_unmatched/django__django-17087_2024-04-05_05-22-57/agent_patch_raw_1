Given the context provided and the issue described, it seems the provided code snippets from the search results do not directly relate to the issue at hand, which involves a `Profile` model with a nested `Capability` class and an `ArrayField` using a `default` method from the nested class. Since the exact location of the buggy code was not found through the search results, I will provide a hypothetical patch based on the issue description. This patch assumes the existence of a file containing the described `Profile` model and addresses the issue of correctly referencing the `default` method of the nested `Capability` class in a migration.

# modification 1
```python
<file>appname/models.py</file>
<original>default=appname.models.Capability.default</original>
<patched>default="appname.models.Profile.Capability.default"</patched>
```

Explanation:
- The original code attempts to set the default value for the `capabilities` field in the `Profile` model using `default=appname.models.Capability.default`. However, since `Capability` is a nested class within `Profile`, the correct reference in the migration should include the full path from the outer class to the nested class. Therefore, the patched code changes the reference to `"appname.models.Profile.Capability.default"`. This string-based path is evaluated correctly by Django when applying migrations, ensuring that the `default` method of the nested `Capability` class is used as intended.

Note: The file path `appname/models.py` is hypothetical and should be replaced with the actual path to the file containing the `Profile` model in your project. The Django app name (`appname`) should also be replaced with the actual name of your Django application.
