Given the limitations in the provided context and the inability to directly access the specific code snippet that needs to be patched, I'll provide a conceptual patch based on the issue description. This patch will be based on the general understanding of the problem, which is the incorrect reference to a class method from a nested class in Django migrations. Since the actual code or file path wasn't successfully retrieved, please consider this as a guideline to apply the necessary changes in your project.

# Conceptual Patch

The issue arises from the incorrect reference to the `default` method of the nested `Capability` class within the `Profile` model in the Django migration file. The migration tries to use `appname.models.Capability.default` but should instead reference it through the `Profile` model, as `Capability` is nested within `Profile`.

Since we don't have the exact original code snippet from the migration file or the model definition, the patch below is conceptual and should be adapted to fit the actual codebase.

## For the Django Model Definition (Hypothetical Location: `appname/models.py`)

Ensure the `Profile` model and its nested `Capability` class are defined correctly. The `default` method should be a class method of the nested `Capability` class.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField

class Profile(models.Model):
    class Capability(models.TextChoices):
        BASIC = ("BASIC", "Basic")
        PROFESSIONAL = ("PROFESSIONAL", "Professional")

        @classmethod
        def default(cls):
            return [cls.BASIC.value]

    capabilities = ArrayField(
        models.CharField(choices=Capability.choices, max_length=30, blank=True),
        null=True,
        default=Capability.default
    )
```

## For the Django Migration File (Hypothetical Location: `appname/migrations/000x_auto_....py`)

In the migration file, the reference to the `default` method should be correctly specified. However, since migrations are auto-generated, the primary fix should be applied in the model definition. Ensure that when you generate migrations (`python manage.py makemigrations`), Django correctly interprets the `default` method reference. If the migration file still contains an incorrect reference, you might need to manually adjust the migration file or ensure that the model definition is correctly understood by Django's migration system.

If manual adjustment is needed (which should be done with caution), the reference in the migration file should look something like this:

```python
# This is a conceptual representation and might not match the exact syntax or structure of your migration file.
operations = [
    migrations.AddField(
        model_name='profile',
        name='capabilities',
        field=models.ArrayField(
            base_field=models.CharField(blank=True, choices=[('BASIC', 'Basic'), ('PROFESSIONAL', 'Professional')], max_length=30),
            default='appname.models.Profile.Capability.default',  # Ensure this string path is correctly pointing to the default method.
            null=True,
        ),
    ),
]
```

**Important Note**: Direct manual edits to migration files should be approached with caution. Always back up your database and test the migration in a development environment before applying it to production. The best approach is to ensure the model definition is such that Django's migration system automatically generates the correct reference.
