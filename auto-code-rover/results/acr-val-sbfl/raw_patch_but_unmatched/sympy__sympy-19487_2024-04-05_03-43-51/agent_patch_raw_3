Given the limitations and the context provided, it's clear that a direct and specific patch cannot be accurately formulated without more precise details from the actual Sympy codebase. The attempt to create a hypothetical patch was based on a general understanding of how such an issue might be addressed within the framework of a mathematical software library like Sympy, but without direct access to the specific implementations and the structure of the current codebase, providing a valid patch is not feasible.

In real-world software development, especially in open-source projects, addressing an issue like this would involve several steps that are not possible in this format, including:

1. **Reviewing the Contribution Guidelines**: Understanding the project's guidelines for contributing, which would include how to submit patches, the coding standards, and the testing requirements.

2. **Collaborating with the Community**: Engaging with the project's community, possibly through forums, issue trackers, or pull requests, to discuss the best approach to the issue.

3. **Accessing the Codebase**: Directly accessing the codebase to locate the relevant implementations of the `sign` and `Abs` functions, which would allow for a precise understanding of the current behavior and how best to implement the desired changes.

4. **Testing and Validation**: Implementing the changes in a local development environment, followed by thorough testing to ensure that the changes address the issue without introducing regressions or unintended side effects.

5. **Documentation**: Updating the documentation to reflect any changes in functionality or behavior resulting from the patch.

Given these considerations, the best course of action for someone looking to address this issue in the Sympy project would be to engage directly with the project through its official contribution channels. This would allow for a more effective and collaborative approach to developing a solution that aligns with the project's standards and goals.
