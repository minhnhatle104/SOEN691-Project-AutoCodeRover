Here's a summary of the findings and their implications:\n\n1. **`is_even` Method Not Found**: The search did not find an `is_even` method in the codebase. This suggests that `is_even` might be a hypothetical or external function used for demonstration purposes in the issue description. Since we can't modify or inspect `is_even`, our focus should shift entirely to improving the assertion messages within pytest's framework, specifically for `all` and `any` assertions.\n\n2. **Assertion Rewriter in pytest**: The search found a snippet related to the assertion rewriter mechanism in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`. This is a crucial piece of information because the assertion rewriter is responsible for transforming assert statements into more detailed error messages. The mention of `_reprcompare` attribute and `DebugInterpreter` suggests that there's a mechanism to extend or customize how assertions are rewritten and interpreted. This could be the entry point for enhancing the error messages for `all` and `any` assertions.\n\n3. **No Direct References to Generator Expressions or List Comprehensions**: The absence of specific code related to generator expressions and list comprehensions in the context of assertion rewriting indicates that there might not be specialized handling for these constructs in pytest's current implementation. This aligns with the issue description, which points out the lack of useful failure messages when using `all` or `any` with these constructs.\n\nGiven these insights, the path forward involves diving deeper into the assertion rewriter mechanism (`src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`) to understand how it currently processes assertions. The goal would be to identify a way to enhance this process to \"unroll\" iterables used with `all` or `any` in a manner that provides more informative error messages, similar to the detailed output seen with for-loop assertions.\n\nThe next steps would involve:\n- Examining the implementation details in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` to understand how assertions are currently rewritten.\n- Identifying if there's a way to detect the use of `all` or `any` with iterables within the assertion rewriter and then transform these assertions into a format that would yield more informative error messages upon failure.\n\nThis approach aims to address the core issue without needing direct references to generator expressions or list comprehensions, focusing instead on enhancing the assertion rewriter's capabilities."

The mention of `_reprcompare` and `DebugInterpreter` suggests that these are key elements in how pytest decides to rewrite assertions and possibly how it could be extended or customized.\n\n- **Enhancement Approach**: To address the issue of uninformative error messages when using `all` or `any` with iterables, the enhancement would likely involve extending or modifying the assertion rewriter's behavior.

Although the exact methods or functions to modify were not directly identified, the reference to `_reprcompare` and the `DebugInterpreter` provides a starting point for further investigation.\n\nTo proceed, a developer would need to:\n1. **Examine `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` More Closely**: Dive into the file to understand the current implementation of the assertion rewriter, with particular attention to how `_reprcompare` and `DebugInterpreter` are used.\n2. **Identify Extension Points**: Look for ways the current mechanism can be extended or customized to improve error messages for `all` or `any` assertions. This might involve detecting these specific assertions and applying a transformation to the iterable they operate on, ensuring that failure messages can pinpoint the exact element(s) that caused the assertion to fail.\n3. **Implement and Test the Enhancement**: Develop the necessary modifications to the assertion rewriter to support more informative error messages for `all` or `any` assertions.
