Given the constraints and the information provided, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach to generate a patch directly without having access to the actual source code structure and current implementation details of the `matplotlib` library. Without the ability to directly view and interact with the source code, generating a precise patch is challenging.

However, based on the understanding of the issue and the typical structure of matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities, a general approach to address the visibility issue for 3D subplots in matplotlib could involve ensuring that the visibility of all components associated with the 3D axes (such as axes lines, labels, ticks, etc.) is correctly toggled in accordance with the `set_visible()` method call. This might involve overriding the `set_visible()` method in the `Axes3D` class or adjusting how visibility is handled for 3D components.

Since a direct patch cannot be provided without access to the specific implementation details, I recommend exploring the `Axes3D` class for methods and attributes related to visibility and considering how they interact with the rest of the matplotlib plotting system. Additionally, reviewing how the `set_visible()` method is implemented in the base `Axes` class could provide insights into how to effectively extend or override this functionality for 3D plotting.

For anyone looking to address this issue in the matplotlib library, I suggest:

1. Reviewing the `Axes3D` class to understand how visibility is currently managed.
2. Identifying all 3D components that need to be shown or hidden in accordance with the subplot's visibility state.
3. Implementing or modifying the `set_visible()` method to correctly toggle the visibility of these components.
4. Testing the changes with various 3D plots to ensure that setting visibility to `False` correctly hides the subplot and its components.

This approach outlines a general strategy for addressing the issue based on the description provided and common practices for working with object visibility in graphical applications.
